## 1: Momentary Peace and a New Journey (1)
**Mihono:** Mmmm\~, yummy\! When it comes to crepes, chocolate covered bananas with creme fraiche is such a must have\!  
**Kofuki:** So annoying. Can't you just shut up and eat?  
**Mihono:** Don't you know? When you're eating something yummy, it tastes ten times better when you say it while you eat\!  
**Kofuki:** That's retarded. Don't tell me you believe that.  
**Kiyoka:** But, it really is yummy. My cheeks feel like they're melting.  
**Mihono:** Yeah, yeah, I know what you mean\! What'd you order, Kiyoka?  
**Kiyoka:** Strawberry ice cream with chocolate whipped cream.  
**Mihono:** Ahhh, I wanted that one too\! I spent so long trying to decide between these.  
**Kiyoka:** Want to taste mine?  
**Mihono:** Can I\!?  
**Kiyoka:** Mm... Go ahead.  
**Mihono:** Then, I'll take you up on that\! Om-  
**Mihono:** Mmmhm\~, so yummy\! The cold ice cream and the crepe taste so good together\!  
**Mihono:** Here, to make things even, try some of mine.  
**Kiyoka:** Th-Thank you... I'll try some- Om...  
**Kiyoka:** Mhmm\! This is yummy... It's so yummy, Hono-chan\!  
**Mihono:** I told you\! Ehehe. Want some too, Fukki?  
**Kofuki:** I don't need any.  
**Mihono:** C'mon, just take a bite\!  
**Kofuki:** I said I don't need any\! Leave me alone\!  
**Chie:** Ufufu. Watching them really calms me down.  
**Mirja:** It's good to see everyone so peaceful, but we need to discuss what we'll be doing next.  
**Mirja:** First, we should-  
**Aradama:** GURURUUUUUU...\!  
**Chie:** Aradama\!?  
**Kofuki:** Alright; nothing like some exercise after eating\! You came out just to see me, didn't you? Well I love you too, aradama-chan\!  

## 1: Momentary Peace and a New Journey (1)
**Mirja:** As I was saying before we were interrupted, I believe we should return to Kamakura as part of our mission to locate both the Akabane swords and Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu.  
**Mirja:** Do any of you disagree?  
**Kofuki:** Looking for the Akabane swords means we get to slice up all the aradama-chans that are with them, doesn't it?  
**Mirja:** That goes without saying. Eliminating aradama is our duty as toji.  
**Kofuki:** Hell yeah-\! So long as I get to play around with aradama-chan, I'm down for whatever\!  
**Mihono:** It's all still pretty confusing, so I'll just follow you, Mirja-san.  
**Kiyoka:** I think... I think that's a good plan too.  
**Chie:** ...  
**Mirja:** What do you think, Setouchi Chie?  
**Chie:** If I'm being honest, I still don't trust y- President Souraku.  
**Chie:** But I'll go along with that, for now.  
**Mirja:** Thank you. Then, let's get going.  

## 3: To Kamakura (1)
**Mihono:** I get that we're looking for Kagemitsu, but do we have any clues? Like, "it might be around here\~" or something.  
**Mirja:** I'm afraid to say we're completely in the dark.  
**Kofuki:** You've seriously got nothing?  
**Mirja:** Each lead that we've found so far has been a bust, which has left us with nothing of any note to go off of.  
**Kiyoka:** So we'll just have to look everywhere until we find something...  
**Mirja:** That's all we can do in our current state.  
**Mihono:** So, we should just focus on tracking down Akabane swords right now?  
**Kofuki:** I'm all for it. Wherever those swords are, there's bound to be aradama-chans swarming around.  
**Kofuki:** Sounds way better than a wild goose chase, doesn't it?  
**Kiyoka:** Sigh\~... That means there's lots more fighting in store for us, isn't there...  
**Kofuki:** Don't worry about it. I'll take care of every last aradama-chan. You guys just hang back and relax.  
**Chie:** You know we can't do that. We're all going to work together out there.  
**Kofuki:** I mean it\! I don't want you ruining any of my fun\~.  
*Chie starts drawing her okatana*

  
**Chie:** Ufufu, we're all going to work together, aren't we?  
**Kofuki:** Seriiiously\~...  
**Chie:** We're ALL going to work together, aren't we?  
**Kofuki:** Tch... Fine, whatever.  
**Chie:** Ufufu. Your onee-san's happy you're being so understanding.  
*Chie puts her okatana away*

  
**Mihono:** Chii-nee's kinda scary sometimes, isn't she?  
**Kiyoka:** ...U-Uh huh.  
**Mihono:** By the way, what kinda okatana is this Kagemitsu?  
**Mirja:** It's a tachi, made at the tail end of the Kamakura period by the artisan Kagemitsu of the Bizen Province.  
**Mirja:** In the year 1568, before his invasion of Suruga, Takeda Shingen offered it to the Sengen Shrine.  
**Mihono:** Okay, I get the history, but why is it so good against a great aradama? What makes it different from any other okatana?  
**Mirja:** In that case...  
**Aradama:** SHAAAAAAAAA\!  
**Kofuki:** What's that? You followed me too, huh? You're always welcome, my lovely aradama-chan\!  

## 4: To Kamakura (2)
**Kofuki:** Alright, enough warmup. Let's get going where we're going. Just lead me to the aradama.  
**Mirja:** Be sure not to lose sight of our objective. The missions we were given were simply to locate the Akabane swords and Kagemitsu.  
**Mirja:** Hunting aradama is not our priority. So please refrain yourself from acting so independently.  
**Kofuki:** I got it already... But we're going to end up fighting them anyway, right? So it's all the same.  
**Mirja:** Depending on the circumstances, that may not always be the case. But I can't deny that here and now.  
**Mirja:** Anyway, if we're all prepared, shall we leave for Kamakura now?  
**Mihono:** I'm ready anytime\!  
**Kiyoka:** I-I'm ready to go as well... I think.  
**Kofuki:** Do I have to say it? Let's go already\!  
**Chie:** I don't have any problem with that.  
**Mirja:** Then, let's depart.  

## 5: Unease (1)
**Chie:** (Blindly searching for Kagemitsu like this will get us nowhere. We're only being sent out here to waste time.)  
**Chie:** (And President Souraku surely didn't tell us the whole story. She has to be hiding something.)  
**Chie:** (Until I know what that is, I can't trust President Souraku, and Mirja-san too...)  
**Chie:** (I'd better ask for support from Mokusa in getting to the bottom of this.)  
*phone ringing*

  
**Chie:** .........  
**Chie:** (...? That's strange. No one's answering? There should always be someone responding to the emergency undercover line...)  
**Chie:** (I hope I'm only overthinking this, but I can't help but feel uneasy...)  
**Aradama:** KIKIKIGIGIGIGIGIGI...  
**Chie:** More aradama\!?  
**Kofuki:** More and more-\! I've been waiting for you, aradama-chans\! Come get your love\!  
**Mirja:** Everyone, get ready for combat\! We're going to eliminate all the aradama\!  

## 6: Unease (2)
**Mirja:** Setouchi Chie, your movements lacked their usual responsiveness. Is something bothering you?  
**Chie:** ...I'm fine.  
**Mihono:** But your face is all pale. Are you sure?  
**Chie:** Thanks for worrying about me. But I'm fine.  
**Mihono:** Really? If something's wrong, you can always tell us. I might not be able to help, but I'll do whatever I can\!  
**Chie:** Ufu, you're so kind, Mihono-chan.  
**Mihono:** But you've always been looking out for me, Chii-nee. So let me return the favor sometimes\!  
**Kiyoka:** M-Me too... You can rely on me... I'm always needing your help, after all...  
**Kiyoka:** Ah... S-Sorry... There's probably nothing I could do to help though, is there...  
**Chie:** No, that's not true. I'm glad to see you two becoming more reliable.  
**Mihono:** We're teammates, after all\! When one of us is in trouble, of course the others'll help out\! Right, Fukki?  
**Kofuki:** Why're you dragging me into this? Like I care\!  
**Mihono:** Ehh\~, c'mon\~\!  
**Kiyoka:** The more we trust in each other, the easier it will be to cooperate... And that should mean... Fighting will get easier...  
**Mihono:** Yeah, yeah\! Kiyoka's got the right idea\!  
**Kofuki:** And that doesn't matter to me. I just do what I want.  
**Mihono:** Fukki-, you gotta open up some more\!  
**Kofuki:** Aghh, just leave me out of this\! Go away\! Shoo, shoo\!  
**Chie:** ("Teammates"...)  
**Chie:** (I'm sorry, Mihono-chan. I just can't think of her like that.)  
**Chie:** (At least, for the time being...)  

## 7: Mokusa Under Attack (1)
*phone ringing*

  
**Chie:** .........  
**Chie:** (This shouldn't be happening; I still can't get through to Mokusa. It's clear that something's wrong.)  
**Chie:** (I have a bad feeling about all this... What's going on over there?)  
At the same time, at the Mokusa hideout--

  
**Mai:** Takako-san, hurry and get on\!  
**Yonemura Takako:** ...Leave without me.  
**Mai:** Eh\!? Takako-san\!  
**Takako:** Keep Akane-sama safe.  
**Mai:** Takako-san\!\!  
**Yume:** Ahhh\~, I didn't make it in time, huh...? Too bad.  
**Takako:** ...What happened to the toji at the shrine?  
**Yume:** Toji? That's what they were supposed to be? They barely even put up a fight though...  
**Yume:** Ahh, but the one with this okatana, she wasn't too bad.  
*Yume throws it at Takako's feet*

  
**Takako:** Satomi...\!  
**Yume:** You wanna fight? In that state? I'll wait for you to recover if you want.  
**Takako:** I don't need your pity\!  
**Takako:** I'd never lose to a toji that needs noro to fight\!  
**Yume:** Is that so.  
**Chie:** (Please let everyone be okay...)  
**Aradama:** KIKIKIGIGIGIGIGIGI...  
**Chie:** I really don't need this right now\!  

## 8: Mokusa Under Attack (2)
**Chie:** Pant, pant, pant...  
**Chie:** One more time... If I call Mokusa one more time...  
*phone ringing*

  
**Chie:** .........  
**Chie:** (...Everyone... What am I supposed to do? What can I even do right now...)  
**Chie:** (No good... It's hopeless. If I just knew what's happening to Mokusa...)  
**Mirja:** What's wrong? You're acting nothing like your usual self. What has you so shaken up?  
**Chie:** ...I said it's nothing.  
**Mirja:** I understand if you feel like you can't trust me. But I can't overlook what my teammates are going through.  
**Chie:** Teammates?  
**Mirja:** At least, that's how I feel about you. And... I want to help.  
**Mirja:** If you still won't talk to me, do you think you could open up to Asakura Mihono or one of the others?  
**Mirja:** There are some problems you can't solve by yourself, but when you share it with others you start to see a solution.  
**Chie:** Mirja-san...  

## 9: What Takes Priority (1)
**Chie:** There's something I need to say. Will you all listen to me?  
**Mihono:** What's up? Why are you acting so serious, Chii-nee?  
**Chie:** (I can't shake the way I feel about Mirja-san, but I think I can trust the way she feels about me.)  
**Chie:** (And, as long as I'm worried about Mokusa, my personal feelings will get in the way of our mission. I have to let it all out.)  
**Chie:** First, let me apologize. There's something I've been hiding from all of you. I'm sorry.  
**Kofuki:** What, you've been stealing into our snacks? Your tits have been looking fatter lately.  
**Kiyoka:** U-Uhh... I don't think, with this atmosphere... I think we should... Take this more seriously...  
**Kofuki:** Hey, don't act like I'm the one screwing around. So, what's your deal, Chichie? This is getting annoying, so spit it out already.  
**Chie:** It wasn't a coincidence that I joined this investigation team. On behalf of a certain organization, I was assigned here.  
**Mihono:** ...\! What organization? ...Chii-nee, what are you talking about?  
**Chie:** Do you remember how I told you Osafune had been looking into the experiments with noro the Origami family was doing?  
**Mihono:** ...Y-Yeah. So you're just talking about Osafune?  
**Chie:** To be precise, Osafune is where it all started: the organization "Mokusa".  
**Chie:** Planning to start a revolution against Origami Yukari, and to return okatana and toji to their rightful state, Mokusa was formed. And I'm one of its members.  
**Mihono:** So, uh... What does that mean?  
**Kofuki:** She's a terrorist, right?  
**Kiyoka:** Terro... Eh...?  
**Chie:** Call me a terrorist if you want. But after seeing the results of their experiments with noro, don't you have a problem with the way Origami Yukari has been handling things?  
**Kofuki:** Not my problem. But honestly, I couldn't care less about what you're up to either, Chichie.  
**Mirja:** ...And so you joined this investigation team to feed us information from Mokusa.  
**Mirja:** It was Mokusa's intention to lead us to Suruga, wasn't it?  
**Chie:** Yes, that's right. I was supposed to show you what Origami Yukari was doing, and what she had done.  
**Chie:** In the time we've been together, I've told you all many lies to lead you on.  
**Mihono:** Chii-nee...  
**Chie:** I don't really regret the path I've chosen, but that alone leaves me with a heavy heart... Pretty selfish of me to complain about it though, huh.  
**Mirja:** I now know what you are, but what I don't understand is why you would choose now to reveal this to us.  
**Mirja:** This isn't just because you couldn't bear the guilt, is it. So what is it you want "us" to do?  
**Chie:** For hours now, I haven't been able to contact Mokusa. I've never heard of this happening once before. There's definitely something wrong.  
**Chie:** I want to know what's going on. And to do that... I need your help. That's all I want right now.  
**Chie:** Given everything I've done, I'd understand if you don't want to work with me. But... Still...  
**Mihono:** It's okay, Chii-nee\! I... I trust you, Chii-nee.  
**Mihono:** You might have lied to us. And you might have led us around. But...  
**Mihono:** But you said all of that hurt your heart. And you came clean and told us everything. So I'll trust you, Chii-nee\!  
**Mihono:** I don't really understand what the head of the family is thinking, but I think it's wrong using aradama like that\!  
**Mihono:** Even if everyone else says no, I'm on your side\!  
**Kiyoka:** M-Me too...\! If one of us is in trouble, it's only natural to help each other out...  
**Mihono:** And of course, Fukki's fine with it too, right?  
**Kofuki:** I told you, I don't care what Chichie's up to. All I want is to have a good time with aradama.  
**Kofuki:** If helping Chichie lets me do that, then whatever else doesn't matter.  
**Chie:** Thank you, all of you...  
**Mihono:** What about you, Mirja-san?  
**Mirja:** Considering what the head of the family has been up to recently, I do find it difficult keeping my faith in her.  
**Mirja:** And I suspect it may in some way be the result of what President Souraku explained to us about a great aradama.  
**Mirja:** However, there is far too little information for me to make a clear decision. Until I find out more, I can't confidently ally myself with either side.  
**Mirja:** Therefore, I've decided I'll have to hear Mokusa make their case directly.  
**Mirja:** That's all there is to it, Setouchi Chie. I'll do what I can to aid you.  
**Chie:** Thank you, Mirja-san.  
**Mirja:** You don't need to thank me. I simply believe it's something I need to do.  
**Mihono:** So then-  
**Aradama:** SSSSHHAAAAAAAAAAA\!  
**Mihono:** Come onnn, we're in the middle of a really important conversation here\! Read the mood, aradama\!  

## 10: What Takes Priority (2)
**Mirja:** Let me confirm something, Setouchi Chie. You want to know Mokusa's current status... That's your highest priority right now, isn't it?  
**Chie:** Yes, that's right.  
**Mirja:** I don't have the full picture yet, but from the way you've spoken about Mokusa, it's not a small organization, is it?  
**Mirja:** If that's the case, shouldn't there be other operatives in the field gathering information?  
**Mirja:** I recommend that we get in contact with whichever of them you are aware is closest to us now.  
**Chie:** Ah... That would have worked... "The one I'm aware is closest to us now"...  
**Chie:** I was careless... I was so panicked I couldn't think of something that simple...  
**Chie:** There's a good chance they'll be able to shed some light on this situation...  
**Chie:** Everyone, we're going back to Aoto-kan.
