## 1: Straightforwardness at Summer's End
**Kofuki:** Oiii, you in here-?  
**Tsugumi:** Oh, what brings you by, Shichinosato-san? We don't have any aradama disposal planned for today.  
**Kofuki:** It's too hot outside, so I stopped by to cool off.  
**Kofuki:** You got anything cold in here? Like, ice cream or something.  
**Tsugumi:** It's almost October too, and yet it's still as hot as ever.  
**Tsugumi:** If you're fine with barley tea, I can get some for you.  
**Kofuki:** So that's a no on the ice cream? Fine, that works too.  
**Kofuki:** Ah, but you'd better not put anything weird in it\!  
**Tsugumi:** I've never once put anything weird in anything...  
**Tsugumi:** Here you go.  
**Kofuki:** Try thinking back over the stuff you've done...  
**Tsugumi:** Hmm... I have no memory of that.  
**Tsugumi:** Ah, when you need to, if you could refill it yourself. I'm right at a good point in this report.  
**Kofuki:** Hmmm.  
**Tsugumi:** ......  
**Kofuki:** ......  
**Kofuki:** Hey.  
**Tsugumi:** What is it?  
**Kofuki:** That stuff's all you've been doing lately, huh.  
**Tsugumi:** Hasn't the investigation team been busy over summer break? For that same reason, these reports have been building up.  
**Kofuki:** Hmmm.  
**Kofuki:** ...  
**Tsugumi:** What's the matter?  
**Kofuki:** If you weren't working with the investigation team, you wouldn't have to deal with those, right?  
**Kofuki:** Isn't that a pain in the ass?  
**Tsugumi:** No, I find it fulfilling.  
**Kofuki:** ...Is that right.  
**Tsugumi:** Yes.  
**Kofuki:** My sweat's cooled off, so I'm gonna get going now.  
**Tsugumi:** Sometimes, it seems like you've mistaken this for a cafe, Shichinosato-san.  
**Kofuki:** It's close enough.  
**Kofuki:** Seeya around, Tsugumi.  
**Tsugumi:** ...  
**Tsugumi:** So... you do remember my name.  
**Kofuki:** What're you talking about?  
**Tsugumi:** This is the first time you've called me by name...  
**Tsugumi:** It's startling when you do things like this, so please keep the surprise attacks to a minimum.  
**Kofuki:** Huhh\!? There's no way I haven't said your name at some point\!\!  
**Tsugumi:** No, as far as I can remember, this is the first.  
**Tsugumi:** Here, come on, try saying it one more time.  
**Kofuki:** I'm not gonna\!  
**Tsugumi:** Come on now, "Tsugumi", like that.  
**Kofuki:** Who cares\! "You"'s good enough for somebody like you\!\!  

## 2: An Unchanging Relationship
**Yui:** Today it's just me and you shopping together, Kiyoka-chan\! That makes this... a date, doesn't it\!\!  
**Kiyoka:** Why does it have to be like that... We only came here to do normal clothes shopping.  
**Yui:** Look at you, getting all shy about it\! You know I'll pick out the per\~fect\~ clothes\~ for\~ you\!  
**Kiyoka:** Ughh... It's true that I have faith in your fashion sense...  
**Yui:** I've already inputted Kiyoka-chan's tastes and the current fashion trends\! The only data I'm missing is...  
**Kiyoka:** Wh-What's that look in your eyes for? You're giving me a bad feeling about this...  
**Yui:** The latest specs on Kiyoka-chan's body\!  
**Kiyoka:** Eeeeep\!?  
**Yui:** Where's the harm in it\! Where's the harm in it\!  
**Kiyoka:** There's plenty harm in it\! You're scaring me, so stop it\!  
**Yui:** Ahaha.  
**Yui:** It's been a while since we got to hang out with just the two of us, so I couldn't hold back my excitement.  
**Yui:** I'll pick out clothes normally for you, don't worry.  
**Kiyoka:** ...  
**Kiyoka:** Do you mean it?  
**Yui:** Have a little faith in me\!  
**Yui:** Like, for example... The outfit that's on display there, I bet it'd look great on you\!  
**Kiyoka:** ...It's true that I like the look of it... But this is why you're so...  
**Yui:** Finished putting it on yet-?  
**Kiyoka:** Not yet-. Just wait a little longer-.  
**Yui:** I can't wait\!  
**Kiyoka:** KYAAAAAAAAAAAA\!?  
**Yui:** ...Well, huh. Your clothes are on.  
**Kiyoka:** What were you going to do if they weren't\!?  
**Yui:** I'd apologize\!  
**Kiyoka:** Don't sound so proud about it\!  
**Yui:** Ahaha, sorry, sorry.  
**Yui:** Since it's been so long since we got to do this, I'm so happy I just can't help it.  
**Kiyoka:** ...That's right, it has been a long time.  
**Yui:** Kiyoka-chan?  
**Kiyoka:** ...Sorry, what's gotten into me. Umm, what I mean is, it's just...  
**Kiyoka:** Just...  
**Yui:** You're crying\!? I-I'm sorry, Kiyoka-chan\!  
**Yui:** I went a little too far, didn't I? I didn't mean to make you cry or anything...  
**Kiyoka:** That's not it, that's not why...  
**Kiyoka:** Yui-chan, I'm so glad...  
**Yui:** Huh?  
**Kiyoka:** After you became a Myouga toji and came back... I wasn't sure if we'd ever get to have fun like this again...  
**Kiyoka:** That's why, I really am happy...  
**Yui:** Kiyoka-chan...  
**Kiyoka:** [sniffle...]  
**Kiyoka:** Sorry, I'll be fine now.  
**Yui:** Thanks for that, Kiyoka-chan.  
**Kiyoka:** Yeah.  
**Yui:** You love me as much as I love you, huh\!  
**Kiyoka:** ...Eh?  
**Kiyoka:** No, that's not what I meant...  
**Yui:** Now that I have your consent, I'm going to get even more touchy feely from now on\!  
**Kiyoka:** Just stop doing thattt\!\!  

## 3: Memories in the Lingering Heat
**Aradama:** OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\!\!  
**Yomi:** Shidou-san, Konohana-san, Tsubakuro-san. I've successfully driven the aradama your way.  
**Yomi:** Please take care of the rest.  
**Maki/Suzuka/Yume:** Right./Understood./Leave it to me\!  
**Aradama:** oooooo...  
**Yume:** What, that's all? This is so boringgg.  
**Maki:** Yume, there's no fun or boring when it comes to missions.  
**Suzuka:** She's right, Yume.  
**Yume:** You don't have to tell me that.  
**Yume:** But still, I can't help it if I'm getting bored.  
**Maki:** Honestly...  
**Maki:** Suzuka and I'll go report we've finished suppressing them. Yume, you take Yomi and go on back ahead of us.  
**Yume:** Okaaay.  
**Yomi:** I've returned.  
**Yomi:** ...Where are Shidou-san and Konohana-san?  
**Yume:** Making a report. They said we could go back before them.  
**Yomi:** I see.  
**Yume:** So then, let's go to the beach\!  
**Yomi:** ......What?  
**Yume:** It's the sea-\!  
**Yomi:** Tsubakuro-san, if you're getting in the water, then please take your shoes off at least.  
**Yume:** Got iiit\!  
**Yume:** Ahahaha\! It's tickling the bottom of my feet\!  
**Yomi:** ...Please be careful for jellyfish.  
**Yume:** It's fine, it's fine\! Anyway, you come on in too, Yomi-onee-san\!  
**Yume:** It's nice and cool\!  
**Yomi:** ...Alright then.  
**Yume:** Awww, summer's almost over and we didn't even get to play around that much.  
**Yume:** The four of us have been doing missions this whole time\!  
**Yomi:** It's to improve the reputation of the special defense team.  
**Yume:** I know that and all, but, since the four of us were all here, I wanted to play around a little\!  
**Yomi:** ...So long as I can be useful with this power, that's enough for me.  
**Yume:** You take everything too seriously-.  
**Yomi:** But this is the reason I returned to you all, and joined the special defense team.  
**Yume:** See what I mean, you're being too serious. You could just say you're happy the four of us get to be together.  
**Yomi:** ...It isn't as if I'm not happy to be working together with you again.  
**Yomi:** But, I abandoned all of you before.  
**Yume:** Yeah, you did.  
**Yomi:** And, for her sake, I'm sure I would as many times as I had to...  
**Yume:** I don't really care though. It doesn't matter what you'd do.  
**Yomi:** Eh?  
**Yume:** Cause we all wanna be together with you, Yomi-onee-san.  
**Yomi:** ......  
**Yomi:** Is that so. ...That seems like it will be difficult to repay you for.  
**Yume:** Repay me? If that's how you feel, then play with me a lot\!  
**Yomi:** ...Play with you?  
**Yume:** Yeah\! Not just on missions; come with me to the beach and stuff like this\!  
**Yume:** I like doing things like that more.  
**Yomi:** ...Understood. If that's what you wish, then I'll join you, Tsubakuro-san.  
**Yume:** Great\! Then, I guess we should head back now, Yomi-onee-san\!  
**Yume:** Maki-onee-san and Suzuka-onee-san'll get mad wondering where we've been\!  
**Yomi:** ...Alright then, Tsubakuro-san.
