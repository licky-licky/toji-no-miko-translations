## 1: The Training Camp Runs into Trouble
The Dance Recital; a fine arts festival presented through a collaborative effort by the Five Traditions.

  
**Its main attraction:** a dance performed in miko attire by eleven select toji.  
**This year, the girls chosen were as follows:** Shidou Maki, Konohana Suzuka, Satuki Yomi, Tsubakuro Yume, Etou Kanami, Yanase Mai, Juujou Hiyori, Mashiko Kaoru, Kitora Mirja, Yamashiro Yui, and Shichinosato Kofuki--  
**Maki:** We're going to do a full rehearsal of the performance now. Ban Tsugumi, you're in charge of the music.  
**Tsugumi:** Right, you can leave the supporting role to me. Ready... Starting the music.  
**Tsugumi:** Three, two, one...  
**Maki:** That's wrong, all wrong\! Ban Tsugumi, stop the music\! Yume, Mashiko Kaoru, Shichinosato Kofuki\!  
**Maki:** You weren't keeping the pace\! We're starting again, from the top\!  
**Yume:** Ehh\~, againnn? I'm bored of this already\~.  
**Kaoru:** I thought I'd get a break from dealing with aradama here, but this might be worse...  
**Kofuki:** Hey, how long're we gonna keep doing this for? Isn't this good enough already?  
**Maki:** Until you can deliver a perfect performance for Yukari-sama, of course.  
**Maki:** That's the entire purpose of this training camp. Now, let's keep going...  
**Suzuka:** Wait, Maki-san. It's about time we gave them a break.  
**Yume:** Hooray-\! A break-\!  
**Maki:** Hold it, Yume\! I didn't say we were taking a break yet\!  
**Maki:** Suzuka\! They still have a long way to go before they're ready\! Do you think we have time to stop now\!?  
**Suzuka:** That's exactly why we should.  
**Suzuka:** This training camp will last quite some time. They'll need a degree of rest every now and then, won't they?  
**Maki:** But...  
**Kaoru:** We'll still be practicing tomorrow, won't we? Let us rest a minute.  
**Maki:** That's not your place to decide...  
**Maki:** ...Maybe I have been pushing you too hard though.  
**Maki:** We're taking a break, everyone. You can all rest until Yume, Mashiko Kaoru, and Shichinosato Kofuki can manage that performance.  
**Kaoru/Kofuki/Yume:** Ehh\~\!?  
**Kanami:** Ahh, I'm worn out-.  
**Mai:** We've been dancing all this time, after all.  
**Hiyori:** Maybe it's because we're using different muscles than usual, but I'm feeling a lot more tired than I expected.  
**Mirja:** This seemed likely to happen, so we do have honey lemon slices prepared. Would you all like some?  
**Hiyori:** Honey lemon slices... That would be nice.  
**Kanami:** Thank you, Kitora-san\!  
**Mirja:** Yamashiro Yui, please hand them out.  
**Yui:** I'm on it, Mirja-san\!  
**Yui:** You can eat these soury sweet honeyed lemons right out of my hands\! And you can lick my fingers clean too if you want\!  
**Mirja:** Stop that, it's unsanitary.  
**Mai:** Haha... Thank you, Kitora-san. I can make another batch for everyone tomorrow.  
**Mirja:** Good, I'll tell Ban Tsugumi that she won't need to make any more.  
**Kanami:** Nn\~\! Sweet and sour... And bitter\!? Eh\!? Why's it so bitter\!?  
**Hiyori:** What's this powder mixed in with the honey\!? Though... I feel like dancing now\!  
**Mai:** ...I think I won't eat any after all.  
**Mirja:** ...That may be for the best.  
**Yomi:** Tsubakuro-san, you are moving your hands incorrectly. Mashiko-san, your body has stopped moving. Shichinosato-san, please do not try to fall asleep.  
**Suzuka:** ...The training camp has only just begun and we're already behind schedule.  
**Maki:** I didn't expect it to be such a struggle. There are lots of minor points they aren't able to keep up with, but...  
**Suzuka:** It's the finishing act, isn't it.  
**Maki:** As toji, they should all be skilled enough for this.  
**Maki:** And despite that, for them to be this this incapable of coordinating their performance...  
**Suzuka:** We still have time before the recital. I'd like to believe they can work things out with enough practice.  
**Maki:** Why now, at a time like this...  
**Tsugumi:** Shidou-san, there's a report of an aradama outbreak in the area...  
**Maki:** We'll all go. You'll join us, Ban Tsugumi.  
**Tsugumi:** That's fine, but it's best if we go quickly. Tsubakuro-san and Shichinosato-san have already rushed on ahead.  
**Kofuki:** Nice timing back there, aradama-chan\! I love you for real-\!  
**Yume:** I'm glad we got to leave practice, but these are all weaklings, so it's still boring\!  
**Yume:** ...By the way, Onee-san. Where are we?  
**Kofuki:** Beats me? All I cared about was chasing down the aradama-chan, so I wasn't paying attention.  
**Yume:** Ehh-\!? You're no help at all.  
**Kofuki:** Playing with aradama-chan was bound to be a million times more fun than that lameass dance practice.  
**Maki:** ...Found you\! Don't go running off on your own\!  
**Suzuka:** Is this a theater? Was there a theater this close nearby?  
**Giraffe:** I understand.  
**Yume:** Wah-\!? A talking giraffe\!  
**Kofuki:** Is that an aradama too? Should I cut it up to be sure?  
**Tsugumi:** Please wait, Shichinosato-san. I've never seen an aradama with such a close resemblance to a giraffe before.  
**Tsugumi:** We should attempt to gather information on it through communication first. You can cut it up when we're done.  
**Giraffe:** I am not an aradama, so may I ask you toji not to cut me.  
**Suzuka:** It knows what we are?  
**Giraffe:** Yes.  
**Giraffe:** I wish for you to suppress the aradama, so the audition may resume.  

## 2: ...Could This Be Another World?
**Maki:** All aradama in the area have been defeated. Suzuka, is the spectrum finder showing you anything?  
**Suzuka:** ...No, that should have been all of them just now. However...  
**Maki:** Suzuka? Is something wrong?  
**Tsugumi:** It's not giving any response, Shidou-san. After entering this theater, the spectrum finder didn't react to the aradama at all.  
**Maki:** ...They didn't show up on the spectrum finders?  
**Tsugumi:** Yes, this is a highly fascinating phenomenon\!  
**Tsugumi:** Could they be a new variety of aradama? Though, the structure of their bodies was familiar. Which might mean, the aradama have evolved in some way...  
**Maki:** Get a hold of yourself, Ban Tsugumi. ...Suzuka, is what she said accurate?  
**Suzuka:** Yes, I've confirmed it myself. Ban-san is telling the truth.  
**Maki:** So what's going on here...?  
**Yume:** Maki-onee-san\! Somebody's fighting some aradama over there\!  
**Maki:** Grh, they just keep coming... Move in to help\!  
**??? (Karen):** YAAAAAAAHH\!\!  
**Aradama:** Gyaa...  
**??? (Mahiru):** Wh-What's going on here\!?  
**??? (Hikari):** Think about that later. HAA\!\!  
**Aradama:** GYAAA\!  
**Kanami:** Ehhh\!?  
**Hiyori:** They're killing aradama without okatana\!?  
**Yui:** And they're so cute to boot\!?  
**Mirja:** (As it seems, these are not ordinary aradama here... No, that's not what matters most now.)  
**Mirja:** This is no time for you to fool around, Yamashiro Yui\! Move to support those girls\!  
**Kofuki:** I dunno who you are, but hands off my aradama-chan\!\!  
**??? (Karen):** Thanks for the help\! Those monster looking things came out of nowhere, and we didn't know what to do\!  
**Kanami:** We were just doing our job. We're toji, after all.  
**Kanami:** And anyway, how'd you beat the aradama\!? That's not an okatana, right\!?  
**??? (Karen):** Otakara? [treasure]  
**??? (Nana):** Not treasure, Karen-chan. She said an "okatana".  
**??? (Juuna):** An okatana... Some type of sword? Like the ones you have, right?  
**??? (Karen):** Banana\! And Junjun too\!  
**??? (Mahiru):** Hey, Karen-chan... These girls, they might have something to do with what's happening...  
**??? (Hikari):** I think so too.  
**??? (Karen):** But, since they're here, that makes them stage girls like us\!  
**Kanami:** ..."Stage girls"?  
**Kanami:** Like performers? Does anyone know about them?  
**Hiyori:** Nope, not me.  
**Kanami:** What about you, Mai-chan?  
**Mai:** No, I haven't heard about them either.  
**??? (Juuna):** We're students of Seisho Music Academy. You've heard of that, right?  
**Yume:** Seisho Music Academy? Do you know about it, onee-sans?  
**Yomi:** No, I've never heard of it.  
**Suzuka:** I should be familiar with prestigious music academies, from socializing in those circles...  
**Suzuka:** But the name Seisho Music Academy doesn't ring any bells.  
**Maki:** Maybe it's not all that prestigious?   
**??? (Maya):** I'm not about to let that comment pass.  
**Karen:** There's no Starlight-\!?  
**Kanami:** What do you mean aradama don't exist\!?  
**Claudine:** So, if I'm understanding this correctly, these girls came from another world?  
**Kaoruko:** Could something out of a fairytale like that happen?  
**Futaba:** You fought them yourself, didn't you, Kaoruko? Those, aradama, you called them?  
**Kaoruko:** ...It might have actually happened after all...  
**Kaoruko:** Which all works out then.  
**Kaoruko:** We've been in a pickle. The audition was suspended thanks to these aradama. Could you defeat them for us?  
**Suzuka:** Audition...? I haven't seen any judges here.  
**Juuna:** It's called an audition, but it isn't like any ordinary audition you're thinking of.  
**Juuna:** Stage girls fight amongst each other, aiming to be the top star.  
**Kofuki:** Hmmm. Well, you don't have to ask. I'll get all the aradama-chan myself.  
**Maki:** Shichinosato Kofuki is right. Defeating aradama is our duty as toji.  
**Kaoru:** Duty's great and all, but... If we beat them all, is that gonna send us back to our world?  
**Maya:** I believe things will work out.  
**Maya:** The giraffe asked for you to suppress the aradama. So, once they are all suppressed, he should send you back.  
**Maki:** Then there shouldn't be a problem. You can leave suppressing the aradama to us.  
**Karen:** ...But, is it really okay for us to make Shidou-san and them do all the work?  
**Mahiru:** I feel the same way. It's not like it's the toji's fault the aradama are here...  
**Hikari:** Besides, this is our audition.  
**Maya:** Which leaves us only one option: we will help suppress the aradama too.  
**Maki:** But, it's dangerous\!  
**Maya:** Despite not being toji, we can defeat these aradama, can't we? There should be no issue then.  

## 3: A Shared Resemblance
**Tsugumi:** Shichinosato-san, there's aradama on our 9 o'clock. Did you notice them?  
**Kofuki:** The hell, what is this place, aradama-chan heaven\!? Bring it on\! Just try and keep up\!  
**Tsugumi:** Don't mind me; go all out.  
**Kaoru:** Look at them go-. At this point, can't we just leave everything to those two?  
**Nene:** Nene\!  
**Kanami:** You know we can't do that\! So long as aradama are here, they're causing problems for Karen-chan and the others\!  
**Mai:** That's right, Kaoru-chan.  
**Mai:** And besides, if we don't get back soon... I'm sure Sayaka-chan and the others will be worried sick.  
**Maki:** Worried, huh...  
**Suzuka:** ...You're losing focus, Maki-san.  
**Maki:** Does it look that way?  
**Suzuka:** There's no other way of looking at it. Wouldn't you ordinarily be leading the charge against the aradama?  
**Suzuka:** But there are three concerns causing you to falter. Will we be able to go home? How is Yukari-sama reacting to this?  
**Suzuka:** And also... about the dance performance.  
**Maki:** ...I can't hide anything from you, can I.  
**Suzuka:** I'm simply worried about the same things you are.  
**Suzuka:** Since we have this opportunity, I'd like to ask these girls for their opinions on our performance. What do you think?  
**Maki:** Ask them?  
**Suzuka:** Yes. Their lives revolve around the stage, don't they? They should be able to offer us valuable insights.  
**Maya:** The closing act of your dance isn't coming along well?  
**Maki:** That's right. Aside from the very end, we can bring it together with few mistakes.  
**Maki:** But, no matter how many times we rehearse it, we never manage to synchronize the end.  
**Maya:** ...  
**Claudine:** It isn't as if your bodies stop moving, is it?  
**Claudine:** From watching you fight with the aradama, each of you should have more than enough basic physical fitness, so all that's left is for you to practice.  
**Maya:** ...Are they not losing sight of their direction?  
**Claudine:** What do you mean by that?  
**Maya:** Assuming the toji are also special students, there isn't a chance they would receive an utterly useless curriculum.  
**Maya:** In which case, their dance must also be treated as an extension of their everyday life.  
**Maki:** An extension of our usual life...  
**Maya:** That's right. Shidou-san, you've been attempting to deviate from your ordinary selves, have you not?  
**Maki:** ...You've hit the nail on the head, Tendou Maya.  
**Maki:** In focusing too heavily on acting as miko for our dance, we've lost sight of being toji.  
**Maki:** ...A theater pro really does see things differently. I'm glad I asked you.  
**Claudine:** I could have told you that much...  
**Suzuka:** (As expected, Tendou-san made a convincing argument. Though... I wonder what has Saijou-san looking so bothered?)  
**Suzuka:** (Her hostile attitude toward Tendou-san seems somewhat familiar...)  
**Yume:** Hmmm. Hey, Yomi-onee-san?  
**Yomi:** What is it, Tsubakuro-san?  
**Yume:** Does Clau-onee-san remind you of anybody? She feels really familiar for some reason...  
**Suzuka:** Oh my, you had the same impression, Yume?  
**Yomi:** ...That would be Konohana-san, wouldn't it? Though she hasn't acted like that for a long time.  
**Yume:** Ehh, Suzuka-onee-san, did you used to be like that?  
**Yomi:** Yes. Just like that.  
**Suzuka:** (...Ahh, so that's what it was.)  
**Suzuka:** Saijou-san?  
**Claudine:** What? It's true that you need to practice. I haven't said anything wrong either.  
**Suzuka:** ...I'm not here about that. It's difficult, isn't it? Following after another.  
**Claudine:** What are you talking about?  
**Suzuka:** There's someone who's captured your attention, isn't there?  
**Claudine:** ...Not really.  
**Claudine:** There's only someone I'm going to surpass. Without fail.  
**Claudine:** Oh, right, about getting opinions on your performance. Since you have the chance, why not ask all of us?  
**Suzuka:** Of course, we will--  
**Tsugumi:** Shichinosato-san, here comes another wave. We may need to break out the flag for this one. [Referring to a flag Japanese fishermen will hoist after catching a huge haul]  
**Kofuki:** Was that supposed to be a joke\!?  
**Kofuki:** And besides, they're all mine\! Nobody's taking them from me\!\!  
**Maki:** Suzuka\! Yomi\! Yume\! We're moving in too\!  
**Yomi:** Understood.  
**Yume:** It's boring fighting these weakling aradama though.  
**Suzuka:** Now that's how Maki-san ought to be.  
**Suzuka:** You've started acting like an elite guard again.  

## 4: The Star We Sought
**Mirja:** After all that, it seems the amount of aradama appearing has decreased.  
**Yui:** I think so too, Mirja-san\!  
**Yui:** If we keep up the pace, we'll be back home in no time... Wait, we can't\!\!  
**Kaoru:** What's wrong with going home?  
**Kaoru:** You want to stay in this aradama infested theater production from hell forever?  
**Yui:** But still\! The lovely ladies from Seisho\! I still need to cozy up with them\!  
**Hiyori:** ...Do you listen to yourself talk?  
**Kaoruko:** Lovely ladies, you say. Well, that's only a natural reaction.  
**Futaba:** Don't flatter yourself.  
**Kanami:** I get what you mean, Yui-chan.  
**Yui:** Kanami-chan\! I didn't think I had an ally here\!  
**Kanami:** Everyone from Seisho, their movements are so beautiful. Right down to their fingertips; it's so precise\!  
**Yui:** ...That's not the kind of ally I was looking for\!  
**Karen:** Stage girls are evolving every day\!  
**Karen:** Even when fighting aradama, you can't forget about the stage\!  
**Mirja:** That's an interesting perspective, Etou Kanami. Unlike Yamashiro Yui's.  
**Mirja:** Everyone from Seisho acts with such finesse, though their fundamental movements are all different.  
**Mirja:** Is there something like schools of swordsmanship within theater performance?  
**Hikari:** ...The difference in our fields of expertise?  
**Juuna:** It might be something like that. Isurugi-san, swordfights are your specialty, aren't they?  
**Futaba:** Yeah, I don't plan on letting anyone show me up when it comes to a swordfighting scene.  
**Mahiru:** For me, it would be the baton?  
**Nana:** The toji girls are the other way around, right?  
**Nana:** There's differences in the details, but the way they move their whole bodies are all tuned for using a sword.  
**Mai:** The way we move our bodies is tuned for using a sword... You mean our fundamentals are the same?  
**Mai:** ...I wonder if that could help us improve our dance performance?  
**Karen:** Dance performance?  
**Maki:** I'll explain that.  
**Karen:** The toji are dressing up as mikos for a dance\!?  
**Junna:** You're all so athletic, so it should be a real show seeing you all moving together.  
**Nana:** Yeah, yeah. I wish I could be there to see it.  
**Karen:** Put on the show for us here\!  
**Maki:** If we want your opinions, the best way would be to practice in front of you.  
**Yume:** Ehh\!? We're doing it now\!?  
**Maki:** Tendou Maya. It might still be far from complete, but will you watch our performance?  
**Maya:** That's an important responsibility. Because it's incomplete, that's all the more reason for you to need our opinions.  
**Hikari:** What do you mean?  
**Claudine:** They can't seem to get their closing act to come together.  
**Karen:** Why do you know that, Clau-chan\!?  
**Claudine:** I heard it from them earlier. They said they wanted advice on how to improve.  
**Hikari:** ...Why didn't you tell us?  
**Claudine:** We were going to, but then the aradama arrived. Anyway, let's move things along. Start your performance.  
**Karen:** That was so intense\!  
**Junna:** Agreed. Getting to see it up close, you get such a sense that those okatana are the real thing.  
**Futaba:** When it comes to the dancing, that's Kaoruko's field, right? You want to help them out?  
**Kaoruko:** You say that, but wasn't that closer to a combat demonstration than a dance?  
**Kaoruko:** I don't have a single bit of advice to offer.  
**Nana:** A combat demonstration... Ah, maybe that's why the just the last part felt different?  
**Maki:** That's it\! Please, tell me more\! What is our performance missing?  
**Karen:** It's hard to say exactly what... When you're swinging your okatana, it's like it's filled with emotion?  
**Karen:** It's like a real dance performance then.  
**Hikari:** It must be because you have a clear image of a target in mind.  
**Nana:** Aradama, right.  
**Mahiru:** So then, why isn't the last part going as well?  
**Claudine:** ...It's because they can't get their mental images aligned, isn't it?  
**Claudine:** Just looking at Maki and Suzuka, there's force behind Maki's movement, but Suzuka's was more delicate, wasn't it?  
**Suzuka:**  Delicate? I wasn't intending to restrain myself...  
**Claudine:** I'm only talking about the difference I felt between what you two were picturing. Maki imagined cutting down an aradama, and...  
**Maya:** Konohana-san had returning her sword to its sheath in mind.  
**Claudine:** Well, that's about it.  
**Maki/Suzuka:** ...  
**Junna:** So, to sum it up, at the very end of this dance performance, you can't unify what you're all expressing?  
**Karen:** Yeah\! That's it\!  
**Kanami:** Our mental image, huh. I think mine is staying on guard.  
**Mai:** I think that's mine too.  
**Hiyori:** I picture striking down my enemy.  
**Yui:** I imagine ending everything with a big group hug\!  
**Kaoru:** Can't we just imagine taking a break, since it's done?  
**Hiyori:** You two... Are you not going to take this seriously?  
**Aradama:** GGGGAAAAAOOOOOO\!  
**Hiyori:** Tch, aradama\!?  
**Suzuka:** Oh my, and a rather large one at that.  
**Claudine:** C'est pire\! ...Could it not have given us a little more time here\!?  
**Karen:** Why are you two acting so calm when there's that giant monster aradama\!?  
**Maya:** Its size has nothing to do with this. They can at last see their performance taking shape.  
**Maya:** Once this aradama is defeated, their dance can be completed.  
**Maki:** Right, so let's go\!  

## 5: A Time We Surely Shared
**Giraffe:** You've done well, toji. The audition will resume.  
**Karen:** If the audition's resuming... That means we took out all the aradama?  
**Kanami:** Now we can go back home, Hiyori-chan\!  
**Hiyori:** ...Can we really go back though? I don't even remember how we got here in the first place...  
**Mai:** Come to think of it, just how much time has passed since we came here?  
**Kaoru:** It might be like Urashima Tarou when we get back. [a fairytale about a man who spends time in an underwater kingdom and finds a century has passed when he returns]  
**Karen:** Hey, Kanami-chan and them can get back fine, can't they?  
**Giraffe:** Of course, I will dutifully return them home.  
**Maki:** That's good to hear.  
**Maki:** ...Before we go, could we show you our performance one last time? I want you to see the final act with all of our minds focused on the same mental image.  
**Maya:** We would be glad to.  
**Karen:** Cause we'll get to see an even better performance than before\!  
**Hikari:** ...I can't wait.  
**Nana:** And this time, I'll be sure to take some good photos of it.  
**Juuna:** Is there any way we could exchange the pictures?  
**Mahiru:** I wonder if we would have time to print it out?  
**Claudine:** Why don't we just test sending it to them now?  
**Futaba:** Test it... Do our phones work the same as theirs?  
**Suzuka:** They look to be the same. Daiba-san, would you mind sending me the data?  
**Nana:** Sure thing. Here, point your phone this way.  
**Kaoruko:** Anyway, how much time do we have left?  
**Giraffe:** They leave right now.  
**Kanami:** Right now... Wait, huh? This is, the boarding house...?   
**Hiyori:** It was a dream?  
**Mirja:** Was that dream about fighting aradama in an underground theater, by any chance?  
**Mai:** I had the same dream too\!  
**Kaoru:** Was it a dream?  
**Nene:** Ne-?  
**Yui:** Don't tell me... Those theater cuties were all a figment of my imagination\!?  
**Suzuka:** No, I don't believe it was a dream.  
**Yume:** Ah\! Suzuka-onee-san\! Is that picture the one Banana-onee-san sent you?  
**Suzuka:** That's right. I still have it, right here. Look.  
**Maki:** The advice they gave us... It won't go to waste.  
**Maki:** First, we're all going to synchronize our mental image of our performance\! After that, we're going to practice\!  
On the day the dance performance would be shown to the public.

  
**Maki:** (Everything's gone well so far... All that's left is the closing act... It'll be fine.)  
**Maki:** (We've shared our mental image, like the stage girls suggested.)  
**Maki:** (All we need is to...\!)  
**Cheers:** HURRAAAAHHHH\!  

## 6: Collecting Suzudaru Cats\!
**Karen:** There really are some things besides aradama that're different between our world and yours, Kanami-chan.  
**Karen:** You still have the Tokyo Tower, right? And it's still red like it's supposed to be, right?  
**Kanami:** Yep, it's still red alright\!  
**Hiyori:** I wonder why things are different. Aradama and okatana don't exist...  
**Hikari:** Starlight, which has been performed countless times around the world, doesn't exist...  
**Mahiru:** Ah, that reminds me. I wanted to ask you something. Does Suzudaru Cat exist in your world too?  
**Mai:** Suzudaru Cat? Hmm, I haven't heard of it. How about you, Kanami-chan?  
**Kanami:** I've never heard of it either.  
**Mahiru:** I don't believe it\~... A world without Suzudaru Cat...  
**Hiyori:** What kind of cat is it?  
**Yume:** Hey, hey. What're you talking about?  
**Karen:** Yume-chan, Yomi-chan. We were just talking about how, isn't it weird how some things are different between our worlds?  
**Mahiru:** Ah\! It's Suzudaru Cat\! So you have it in your world after all; thank goodness\~.  
**Yomi:** What do you mean, Suzudaru Cat?  
**Mahiru:** Eh\!? You're holding it right there\~.  
**Yume:** Huhh. So this thing's called Suzudaru Cat?  
**Yume:** It dropped off of an aradama just now.  
**Mai:** An aradama?  
**Kanami:** That's Suzudaru Cat...?  
**Kanami:** Woww... It's too cute, Mahiru-chan\! There's this sort of unexplainable charm to it\!  
**Mahiru:** Isn't there? Suzudaru Cat has that kind of cuteness you just can't describe-\!  
**Mahiru:** Ahhh, I'm glad I found someone who can understand Suzudaru Cat's greatness\~.  
**Karen:** I'm happy for you, Mahiru-chan.  
**Mai:** You like those kind of mascot characters, don't you, Kanami-chan?  
**Kanami:** Yeah, I love them\!  
**Kanami:** Hey, Tsubakuro-san, Satsuki-san? What was it like when you got that Suzudaru Cat?  
**Yume:** Just before the aradama I killed dissappeared, it was like, poof\!  
**Yomi:** I can't say it will be the same for all aradama, but that's what it was like with the one we defeated.  
**Kanami:** Cool, so while we suppress the aradama, we can also collect a bunch of Suzudaru Cats\!  
**Mahiru:** Defeating aradama means getting Suzudaru Cats...\!  
**Mahiru:** Etou-san\! If it's alright with you, do you think you could... share some of the Suzudaru Cats you find?  
**Kanami:** Of course\! I'm not about to take them all for myself\! Let's share them with everyone\! Hiyori-chan, you're fine with that too, right?  
**Hiyori:** I-I never said I wanted any, did I?  
**Kanami:** But they're so cute. I know I'll come to like them soon enough.  
**Hikari:** Mr. White is even more amazing though... [mumbled]  
**Hiyori:** Did you say something, Hikari?  
**Hikari:** ...I didn't say anything.  
**Kanami:** Come on, let's go ask everyone to start collecting Suzudaru Cats from the aradama\!  

## [WARNING. I didn't actually roll Mai so I only ever happened to see part 1]
**Stage Girl Mai:** Start: Two Triangles  
**Kanami:** I can't wait to spar with all these stage girls\! If I miss this, I'll never get another chance.  
**Kanami:** You know, I've wanted to spar with them ever since we came here and saw them fighting those aradama.  
**Mai:** You said the same thing back when you first saw Hiyori-chan at the tournament, didn't you, Kanami-chan.  
**Kanami:** Ehehe.  
**Hiyori:** You did? Though it sounds just like something you'd do.  
**Kanami:** Ah, Hiyori-chan. What's up?  
**Hiyori:** What do you mean, "What's up?" You're the one who said to meet here so we can spar now.  
**Kanami:** Oh yeah\! Then, let's get right to it, Hiyori-chan\! I'll catch up with you later, Mai-chan\~.  
**Mai:** Okay. Be sure not to get hurt, you two.  
**Mai:** ......  
**Mahiru:** Mai-chan?  
**Mai:** Tsuyuzaki-san? Did you need something?  
**Mahiru:** Nothing in particular, but I was watching you with Kanami-chan. You seem close.  
**Mai:** We sure are. As soon as we met in middle school, we were fast friends. We often spend time together, in classes and the dorms.  
**Mahiru:** Just like Karen-chan and I. Since the start of high school, we've always been together as roommates\! Though now there's three of us, since Hikari-chan moved in.  
**Mahiru:** What about Hiyori-chan? Her uniform is different, so she's from a different school, isn't she?  
**Mai:** We got to know Hiyori-chan during an incident at the tournament in our second year, and we've been friends ever since.  
**Mai:** It all started with Kanami-chan befriending Hiyori-chan.  
**Mahiru:** So that's what happened.  
**Kanami:** Mai-chaaan, Tsuyuzaki-saaan\! There's some aradama, so come over here\!  
**Mai:** We should go.  
**Mahiru:** Okay\!  
**Aradama:** GGGIIII\!  
**Mai:** Tsuyuzaki-san, one of the aradama went that way\! Could you get it\!  
**Aradama:** GGIIIII\!  
**Mahiru:** It's a little... Scary, but I'll do it\!  
**Mahiru:** EIIIIIII\!\!  
**Mahiru:** There\! Home run\!  
**Mahiru:** It looks like we just finished cleaning up the aradama too.  
**Mai:** The aradama's really gone... You're incredible, Mahiru-san.  
**Mahiru:** It sort of looked like a ball, so I just gave it a good whack on reflex.  
**Mai:** That was only your reflexes...?  
**Mai:** And not just that, but how you casually twirled around that weapon of yours like a baton as you fought...  
**Mai:** The way you moved... I think I could use it as reference in future fights.  
**Mahiru:** It's sort of embarrassing hearing you talk like that, Mai-chan.  
**Mahiru:** But, would it really be helpful learning from me?  
**Mai:** I'd like to give it a try. Will you teach me how?  
**Mahiru:** Mmm, but even if I teach you how to twirl a baton, it's not very useful for fighting, is it? I just somehow make it work...  
**Mahiru:** I know\! Mai-chan, could we try training like we're really fighting?  
**Mai:** Of course, if that's alright with you.  
**Mahiru:** Then, let's do it over there.  
**Mahiru:** I love the shining stage, but I love seeing you shine even more. I want to dance with you forever, in a duet going round and round. 99th generation, Tsuyuzaki Mahiru.  
**Mai:** That line just now had such a stylish ring to it.  
**Mahiru:** Ehehe, thank you. It makes me happy, hearing you say that. I get the feeling we're sort of alike, Mai-chan.  
**Mai:** We're alike?  
**Mahiru:** But we can talk about that after\!  
**Mahiru:** Fighting might be more of your specialty, but come try me, Mai-chan\!  
**Mai:** Here I come\!  
**Mahiru:** Ah, but I would appreciate it if you go a little easy on me after all.

## [Stage Girl - Kanami: Start]: Somebody I Want to Spar With\!
**Maya:** Now then, I'll have you leave the stage. --HAAH\!  
**Karen:** YAH\!  
**Karen:** Nice\! I beat it-.  
**Aradama:** GUGGGIIIII\!  
**Hikari:** You won't get away-- This will finish it\!  
**Kanami:** These stage girls, they're all so amazing, aren't they\! They fight differently from a toji, but I'm enjoying myself just watching them go\!  
**Yui:** Ahh... You can't help but be captivated by them, can you\~.  
**Yui:** Would you call it their posturing? Every one of the motions they go through grabs hold tight of my heart... It's so good\!  
**Kanami:** Yeah, I know just what you mean\! Ahh, even if only for a little bit, I want to spar with all the stage girls\!  
**Karen:** Kanami-chan, Kanami-chan, what's "spar" mean?  
**Kanami:** Ah, sparring is when you face off... It's a practice match\!  
**Karen:** A practice match, huh\~. I think I might wanna have one too\!  
**Futaba:** It'd be useful reference material for sword fights on stage, wouldn't it.  
**Kaoruko:** Sure would. Though, I'm not about to join you.  
**Kanami:** Sure\! You only have to join in if you want to\! I don't think it's good to force training in.  
Hikari Slipping through my firmly raised hands, the vow we made that day fell into the abyss. I once again climb towards my stage of destiny. Even if it must end in tragedy... 99th generation, Kagura Hikari. It is all for the sake of Starlight\!

  
**Kanami:** Wow-, being able to recite a line like that so smoothly; people training to be pros sure are something else.  
**Hikari:** I am a stage girl, so this much is natural.  
**Kanami:** Even still, it's pretty amazing.  
**Kanami:** Oh yeah, thanks, Hikari-chan.  
**Hikari:** What? Why are you thanking me suddenly?  
**Kanami:** For sparring with me. I'm really happy you agreed\!  
**Hikari:** I just thought this experience might be useful on the stage. Are you ready?  
**Kanami:** I'm ready to go anytime\!  
**Hikari:** Then... --YAH\!  
**Kanami:** That was a nice thrust, Hikari-chan\! Now I'll go\! HAAH\!  
**Hikari:** ...Kh\! Then, I'll--\!  
**Hikari:** ...You're watching my movements closely.  
**Kanami:** That's good\! Show me more and more, Hikari-chan, of the way that you fight\!  

## [Stage Girl - Kanami: End]: It Is All for the Sake of Starlight\!
**Hikari:** ...There-\!  
**Kanami:** \!? That was a little risky just now\!  
**Kanami:** You're using the spring in your body to get even sharper with your strikes\! That was a great thrust\!  
**Hikari:** ...You were able to dodge that just now? Toji really do have great physical performance.  
**Kanami:** It's important to be able to avoid taking hits in battle, after all. That's a part of training too.  
**Hikari:** Then, what will you do if I do this?  
**Kanami:** Eh\!? You threw your weapon\!?  
**Hikari:** Thank you. You deflected it just how I wanted you to.  
**Kanami:** Wawah\!? ...She's flying with a wire\!?  
**Hikari:** And now--\!\!  
**Kanami:** Seeing that attack just now you did with the wire sent a chill up my spine-. You were right up in front of me all of a sudden.  
**Kanami:** So you can fight like that too, huh\!  
**Hikari:** ...You blocked it so easily though.  
**Kanami:** I mean, if I didn't block that right, I'd be done for. It wasn't easy for me at all.  
**Hikari:** There's something I want to ask you... Why did you decide to have a match with me?  
**Kanami:** Because I saw you not even flinching as you were fighting aradama, I guess.  
**Hikari:** That should be the same for the other stage girls too. We all want the auditions to resume soon.  
**Kanami:** You're right, but you were still a little different after all. I think it would be scary to fight with that short sword-like dagger, Hikari-chan.  
**Kanami:** But still, you have a strong determination to fight. That's the feeling I got. So that's why I wanted to spar with you.  
**Hikari:** ......  
**Kanami:** And once we got down to it, it was super exciting\!  
**Kanami:** Ah\! I wish I could try moving around with wires like you did, Hikari-chan-.  
**Hikari:** You can't; I won't give it to you.  
**Kanami:** I can't-? That's a bit of a shame\!  
**Kanami:** Hey. Hikari-chan, what did you think of sparring with me?  
**Hikari:** Hm, real swordfighting was incredible. Teach me. Even if it's only the basic movements.  
**Kanami:** Sure thing\! I'll welcome anybody interested in swordfighting with open arms\! We'll start with your stance, okay?  
**Hikari:** This kind of seems like it could take a while... But, I'll be in your care.
