## 1: A New Toji (1)
**Kofuki:** Come on, there's no end to them\! How many toji have they got in here? Weren't they supposed to be short on guards?  
**Chie:** Yes, the majority of them should have gone to the Port of Yokosuka to apprehend Akane-sama.  
**Mihono:** And imagine if they hadn't... I'm getting dizzy just thinking about it.  
**Kofuki:** For real. We owe you one, Akane-sama.  
**Chie:** Even with the majority of her forces elsewhere, she's still this protected. What can you expect from the one at the head of both the toji and the Origami family.  
**Kofuki:** Still, she's a great aradama on the inside. Ahh, I wish this were going smoother.  
**Mihono:** Sure the toji here are all pretty strong, but I'm relieved they're not using noro like the elite guard were...  
**Mihono:** That's just wrong no matter how you think about it.  
**Chie:** Maybe, including the elite guard, that power was only given to a small fraction of toji.  
**Kofuki:** Well of course. If every one of them was using aradama, the whole world would be flipped upside down.  
**Chie:** But if things go according to their plan, that's how it'll end up anyway. Above all else, that's what we have to prevent.  
**Kofuki:** Still, if they actually beat the great aradama, we won't need Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu anymore, right?  
**Kofuki:** Though it's not like we've had much luck while looking for Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu, or the Akabane swords in general lately, huh\!  
**Chie:** A-A lot's happened\! There's no helping it.  
**Mihono:** Right, it can't be helped\!  
**Kofuki:** Anyway, when's this gonna be over\! Give it a rest already\!\!  
**???:** Ah-, there you are\! So that's where you went. I've been looking all over the estate for you\!  
**Kofuki:** Tch... Another one\!? Just sit still so I can lay your ass flat\!\!  
**Mihono:** Fukki, stop\! She's not using utsushi\!  
**Kofuki:** Wait, what...\!? Shit-\!\!  
**???:** Whoa. I almost literally got in over my head this time. A second later and my neck would have been saying goodbye.  
**Kofuki:** Have you gone nuts\!? Or were you thinking we'd go easy on you if you don't use utsushi?  
**???:** Ehh\~? It's because I'm on your side\! I'm your ally\! A friend\! Didn't they tell you\!?  
**???:** They didn't tell you? ...Looking at your reactions, they definitely didn't tell you. That's so rude.  
**???:** Aoto's Youji-san and Yamashiro Yui both must have forgotten to mention it. Those two can be so hard to work with.  
**???:** And here I was so excited to get to help out the investigation team Kitora-senpai was assigned to. I can't believe it\!  
**Chie:** You're... Suzumoto Hana? Am I right?  
**Hana:** Good\! There's at least someone here who recognizes me\! And you're Chie-san; Setouchi Chie-san, right?  
**Chie:** Yes. I've heard a lot about you.  
**Mihono:** You know her, Chii-nee? Then she's telling the truth about coming to help us out?  
**Mihono:** We could use your help, Suzumoto Hana-san\! I'm Asakura Mihono. You can call me Mihono.  
**Kofuki:** That's enough introductions for now. Look, another group's coming\!\!  
**Toji:** You rebels, we won't let you get away with this\!\!  
**Hana:** Looks like I already have a chance to be useful.  
**Hana:** Acting serious is all I'm good at, but I'll do what I can here\!  

## 2: A New Toji (2)
**Hana:** No wonder you were all picked for the investigation team. You're all so capable\!  
**Mihono:** You too, Hana-san\! You said being serious is all you're good at, but that's not true at all\!  
**Chie:** Acting serious is all you're good at... Right. Suzumoto-san. Is it okay to talk about it with these two?  
**Suzu:** Yes, there's no problem with that. In fact, talking about it might help them trust me faster.  
**Kofuki:** What are you getting at, Chichie?  
**Chie:** She was sent undercover by Mokusa into Ayanokouji Martial Arts School as an informant. In other words, she was a member of Mokusa from the start.  
**Mihono:** Informant...?  
**Kofuki:** She means a spy. Stop interrupting over every little thing.  
**Chie:** She was chosen to be an informant in the first place because she's talented. Even if acting serious were all she's good at, it helps all the more in blending in at Ayanokouji.  
**Hana:** Wow... It's embarrassing when you flatter me like that... Ahaha. Still, it's true, acting serious is more or less all I'm good at.  
**Hana:** At this time, I, Suzumoto Hana from Ayanokouji Martial Arts School, have been instructed by President Souraku to join this investigation team\!  
**Chie:** Which means you're our reinforcements, doesn't it.  
**Chie:** However, I can't tell what President Souraku's intent is here. Did she send you because she already found out you're a member of Mokusa, or was it just coincidence...?  
**Hana:** Yes. I can't quite tell what President Souraku is thinking yet either... But, if you'll give me the opportunity, I'll do my best to prove my worth\!  
**Hana:** Though... Um, I'm supposed to "join the investigation team", but will you let me join you?  
**Chie:** Of course, you're very welcome. After all, we're both with Mokusa. Do you mind if I call you Hana-chan from now on?  
**Hana:** Okay\! It's an honor\!  
**Mihono:** Yeah, I'd love to have you with us too\!  
**Hana:** And then, you there, your name was Shichinosato Kofuki-san, wasn't it?  
**Kofuki:** Just call me Kofuki.  
**Hana:** Understood\! Then, joining the investigation team from here, I, Suzumoto Hana, will be working to assist you\!  
**Hana:** Please look after me.  

## 3: Girls are a Precious Treasure (1)
**Yui:** For every aradama we beat, another one takes its place. In fact, aren't there more of them than before?  
**Kiyoka:** Mm... And on top of that, they keep getting stronger...  
**Yui:** Ahh, you thought so too? So I wasn't just imagining things. Good, good.  
**Kiyoka:** That's not good at all...  
**Yui:** But it's not all bad, you know.  
**Yui:** Even if they don't want to, thanks to all the aradama swarming around, the guards have to focus on them instead of coming after us.  
**Kiyoka:** But in their place, the aradama's attacks are more aggressive... So haven't things actually gotten worse?  
**Yui:** That's true\! Aradama never go easy on you, after all. The way they attack so stubbornly makes me want to cry, honestly\!  
**Kiyoka:** So it's really all bad after all...  
**Yui:** No, no, that's where you're wrong, Kiyoka-chan. That's besides the point. Think about it like this.  
**Yui:** Even if an aradama's bitter attacks hit you right in the soul, it hurts me a thousand times more to have to beat down one of those guard girls with my okatana\!  
**Kiyoka:** I-If that's how you feel... But, I can kind of understand it too.  
**Yui:** Women exist to be loved; girls are a precious treasure\! And that's why, going up against aradama is waaay waaay waaaaaaay easier.  
**Kiyoka:** I-Is that so... But, I kind of can't understand now.  
**Mirja:** Unbelievable... It's impressive how much you're able to talk in these circumstances. Though I greatly prefer it over being too nervous to act, at least.  
**Mirja:** Aradama are approaching from our right hand side. No more talking for now.  

## 4: Girls are a Precious Treasure (2)
**Aradama:** SHAAAAAAAAA\!  
**Kiyoka:** We just defeated those ones... And now more new aradama are showing up...  
**Yui:** Mmm, this is a real brawl. Feels like no one else has the time to spare worrying about us.  
**Mirja:** Since it's come to this, there's no point in our distraction operation anymore. It should be safe to assume our initial goal has been accomplished.  
**Kiyoka:** In that case... What do we do now?  
**Mirja:** The guards are struggling to deal with the aradama that keep appearing. If things continue at this rate, the aradama will overrun the estate and spill out into the neighboring city. Before that can happen, our top priority is suppressing these aradama.  
**Yui:** Hooray\~, that's much better than fighting against more girls\!  

## 5: Fighting to Unite (1)
**Kofuki:** So, how long are we supposed to stay hanging around here?  
**Chie:** Until it's all over, of course.  
**Kofuki:** Get real, we're going to run out of gas eventually. The faster we're done the better.  
**Kofuki:** Newbie, since you just got here you should have plenty of stamina to go. Work overtime to cover for us. Especially me\!  
**Hana:** Leave it to me\! That's why I came as your reinforcement, after all\!  
**Kofuki:** I was making a joke. You really are too serious.  
**Mihono:** Ehh\~, Fukki. Was that your idea of a joke\~?  
**Hana:** It won't be a problem; it's my mission after all\! I'll treat it as seriously as I always do.  
**Chie:** In this situation, if you could help us keep driving a wedge in, there's nothing more I could ask of you.  
**Chie:** Honestly, arriving when you did really saved us. Right now, I'll take anyone who's willing to help fight.  
**Hana:** I'll do my best to meet your expectations\!  
**Mihono:** You're strong, Hana-san, so you'll do fine\! I know we can count on you\!  
**Hana:** But, it's been a while since we infiltrated. Mokusa's people should be here by now, shouldn't they? Are they alright?  
**Mihono:** You don't have to worry about them. Kanami won't be beaten that easy\!  
**Chie:** If they ran into an unexpectedly tough enemy-- For example, if they were unlucky enough to face the elite guard, they might have gotten stuck.  
**Mihono:** Even then, Kanami would definitely get past them\!  
**Chie:** As of now, all we can do is trust in them and try to make things easier by continuing to clear their way.  
**Kofuki:** And just as you said that, another group of guards showed up. They're not gonna give us any breathing room, are they.  

## 6: Fighting to Unite (2)
**Kofuki:** Aghh, I'm getting stressed out. Fighting other toji isn't doing anything for me here.  
**Kofuki:** The only thing that keeps me satisfied is aradama-chan, after all. Ahh\~, just thinking about it's getting me in the mood to take one on\!  
**Kofuki:** Can't we just go and raid the shrine right now? I wanna find out what that great aradama's like already. For sure it'll be nothing like the usual ones.  
**Kofuki:** So you just know going up against it'll feel the best\!  
**Chie:** We can't do that. So long as we don't know the method of suppressing a great aradama, we wouldn't stand a chance if we confronted it.  
**Chie:** We'd only be throwing our lives away. You know I won't allow it.  
**Kofuki:** Awww\~, but I wanna face off against the great aradama too\!  
**Chie:** We need to stay focused on doing what we can here so we don't regret it later.  

## 7: The Price of Power (1)
**Yume:** Pant... Pant... Pant...\!  
**Ellen:** Ughh..........  
**Kaoru:** Gh.........  
**Nene:** Ne.........  
**Yume:** I have to... Go... Pant, pant... I don't have a lot... Of time left...  
**Yume:** I have to... Keep on... Fighting...  
**Yume:** Cough\! Cough\!  Kh... Ugh\!? I have to, hurry...  
**Yume:** Ughh\!?  
**Yume:** Agh... Aghh... Cough\! Cough\!  
**Yume:** Is this... It? I didn't even, get to do enough. I wanted to show everyone, an even better me.  
**Yume:** I don't need anything else. Just don't forget me... That's all...  
**Yume:** ............  
**Maki:** Yume? Is that you over there, Yume\!?  
**Yume:** .........  
**Maki:** ......Even after accepting noro to go on living, you still couldn't avoid this cruel fate...?  
**Maki:** In the end, what did accepting this power give us...  
**Maki:** Tell me... Yume?  
**Mirja:** Haah-\!\!  
**Aradama:** GGGYAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Kiyoka:** Pant, pant, pant... After all this... I can't go on much longer... Khh...\!  
**Yui:** Kiyoka-chan, hang in there\!  
**Kiyoka:** O-Okay... Thanks...  
**Mirja:** After the number of battles we've fought back to back, exhaustion is unavoidable. However, the guards are in the same situation.  
**Mirja:** There's still a unit fighting them back, but as the aradama continue to multiply, their morale is dropping and their coordination failing.  
**Mirja:** If this continues, the aradama will soon...  
**Mirja:** You\! Your formation is falling apart\! Do you want the aradama to escape into the city\!? This is the time to do your duty as toji\!  
**Toji:** Wh-What are you acting all high and mighty for, you traitor\! I don't want to hear it from you\!\! Hyaaaah-\!  
**Toji:** See? What do you think of that\!  
**Mirja:** Just like that. Maintain your focus and deal with the situation at hand. You can cry about it once it's all over.  
**Toji:** Who's crying... As soon as we finish with the aradama, you're next, you know\!  
**Yui:** Way to go Mirja-san, she got the guards back in order.  
**Mirja:** The guards have been re-invigorated. We can't afford to slack either\!  
**Kiyoka:** Right\!  

## 8: The Price of Power (2)
**Mirja:** We'll eliminate them all in one fell swoop here\! I know it's difficult, but bear with it for now\!  
**Yui:** Roger that\! Let's finish strong, Kiyoka-chan.  
**Kiyoka:** Right\! I'm not the only one working hard, after all... Hono-chan and the others must be too...  
**Yui:** That's true. We can't let them make us look bad\!  

## 9: At the End of a Struggle (1)
**Kanami:** This is... The shrine...? It feels different in here.  
**Hiyori:** Yes. This must be... ...\!?  
**Yukari:** --So the two young birds have returned.  
**Kanami & Hiyori:** \!?  
**Hiyori:** This feeling...  
**Hiyori:** Origami Yukari\!  
**Kanami:** Hiyori-chan\!  
**Hiyori:** Right-\!  
**Yukari:** Has the time come for you to leave the nest? Or do you yet remain as chicks... Prove it to me with those swords.  
Going back in time a little--

  
**Hana:** Still, it's depressing thinking about the toji here. They're being told to fight without understanding what's really going on.  
**Kofuki:** What, you're feeling sorry for them now?  
**Hana:** No. They're still the ones who accepted this mission, after all. It's not quite feeling sorry for them.  
**Mihono:** Then, what is it you're worried about, Hana-san?  
**Hana:** It's difficult to put into words. Sometimes losing a life is an inevitable part of the mission. But... To be lied to about that mission...  
**Hana:** I wouldn't want that to happen to me... That's what I'm feeling.  
**Chie:** I understand how you feel. It's only natural to think that way, as an informant.  
**Chie:** But that's all the more reason. For the sake of our mission, we can't afford to treat our lives carelessly. Right, Hana-chan?  
**Hana:** Of course\! My mission is to--  
**Mihono:** \!? That sound, it came from the shrine\!?  
**Chie:** Does that mean the fight against the great aradama has already started\!?  
**Kofuki:** Oi, oi, since when did they pass us? I didn't notice a thing\!  
**Hana:** In this mayhem, it's not unthinkable that we could miss them. Speaking of which, everyone\! There's another group of guards coming\!  

## 10: At the End of a Struggle (2)
**Mihono:** Chii-nee, I think I'm going to go after Kanami after all\!  
**Chie:** Even if you go, you might not be able to do anything, you know?  
**Mihono:** I won't know that unless I go. There might be... There might be something I can do to help\!  
**Mihono:** If I could make a difference and I didn't try, I know I'd regret it for the rest of my life\!  
**Mihono:** So please, Chii-nee\! Let me go\!  
**Chie:** I know from that face you won't listen to me. But no. I can't let you.  
**Mihono:** Chii-nee\!  
**Chie:** If you go alone, you might not make it. So I'll go with you.  
**Kofuki:** I'm going too. I've gotta check out this great aradama\!  
**Hana:** And I'll join you, of course. It's my mission after all\!  
**Mihono:** Guys... Yeah, let's go\! To Kanami\! We'll all go together\!
