## [Ceremonial Dress Misogi - Ellen: Start]: Let's Go On a Trip to Change the World\!
**Ellen:** Hmm, hm hm hm hmm\~. Hm hmm hm hm hmm\~\! ...It's done\!  
**Ellen:** My Nene drawing is finished\! That's another one that turned out very cute\!  
**Ellen:** I'll show it to the people of the world right away. ...Okay, it's uploaded\! Now to spread it on social media... Wow\!  
**Ellen:** It's already getting comments\!  
**Comment 1:** ...A tanuki?  
**Comment 2:** Maybe it's an extension cord. That tail thing looks like it plugs in.  
**Comment 3:** It's so crappy I can't tell what it's supposed to be.  
**Ellen:** ...Oh, it's no good again. Does it really look that bad?  
**Ellen:** ...No, I can't go letting it get me down\! My art's going to show them aradama don't have to be scary\!  
**Ellen:** So I can make more friendships like Kaoru and Nene... I'll try my hand at making a manga next\!  
**Ellen:** It's Hokkaido-\!  
**Kaoru:** ...I've never traveled that cozy before in my life. First class is insane. I can't go back to the overnight bus after that...  
**Nene:** Nee.  
**Ellen:** I asked a friend and they set it up for us\!  
**Nene:** Nenene\!?  
**Kaoru:** ...I never can tell what's up with your connections. So, what're we in Hokkaido for anyway?  
**Ellen:** To make the world a better place-\!  
**Kaoru:** .........Huh?  
**Kaoru:** We're on vacation and there's still aradama-\!?  
**Ellen:** Kaoru-\! One's going your way\!  
**Kaoru:** "One's going your way\~" Come on\! I only came with cause you said we were going on a trip to Hokkai... do\!\!  
**Ellen:** And we are here in Hokkai... do\!  
**Ellen:** Phew, that was the last of them now. Nene? Could you strike a pose there... like, "I beat the aradama\!"  
**Nene:** Ne-\!  
**Ellen:** That's perfect-\! You're looking cool, Nene\!  
**Kaoru:** ...Is that a sketchbook? What're you doing now?  
**Ellen:** Please give me some quiet here, Kaoru\! Nene, be sure not to move, okay?  
**Kaoru:** ...Well, I'm fine with whatever so long as I get a break. Though...  
**Ellen:** ......  
**Kaoru:** She still sucks at drawing, huh. I can't even tell what that's supposed to be.  

## [Ceremonial Dress Misogi - Ellen: End]: I've Done It\!
**Ellen:** It's Okinawa-\!  
**Kaoru:** Nobody told me we were making a 2 days 1 night trip across Japan...  
**Nene:** Ne-...  
**Ellen:** Didn't I tell you we were on a trip to make the world a better place?  
**Kaoru:** Just going to Hokkaido is enough of a trip\! And, what's the deal with drawing Nene doing weird poses everywhere?  
**Nene:** Nenenene\!  
**Ellen:** Fu fu fu. That I can't even tell you about yet, Kaoru. You can look forward to it when we get back.  
**Kaoru:** Is that how it is. So, where're we going this time? You looked up stuff for Okinawa too, didn't you?  
**Ellen:** Unfortunately, there wasn't any news on aradama in Okinawa. So, let's go to a Ryukyu karate dojo\!  
**Kaoru:** ...What happened to making the world a better place?  
**Kaoru:** Aghh... Ahh... This sucks; you didn't say anything about training on the beach...  
**Nene:** Nee... Neee...  
**Ellen:** You're never going to get your black belt if that's enough to make you call it quits\! You both need more training, Kaoru, Nene\!  
**Kaoru:** I'm pretty sure I've never said I wanted a black belt.  
**Kaoru:** ...But you seem pretty good at this, Ellen. Were you doing Ryukyu karate on top of Taisha-ryu or something?  
**Ellen:** Yes\! It's just something I picked up in the past.  
**Kaoru:** Where'd you pick that up?  
**Ellen:** Huh, didn't I tell you? A little bit before we met, I was here in Okinawa.  
**Kaoru:** Ahh... That sounds familiar, come to think of it. You were helping with that what's-it-called development place, right?  
**Ellen:** The Special Rare Metals Applications Research Institute. I was a test operator for storm armor there.  
**Kaoru:** So then, you must've been living around here, huh...  
**Ellen:** Yes\! I know tons of great places to eat too\!  
**Kaoru:** Now that sounds good. Take me somewhere you recommend.   
**Ellen:** Sure thing\! There's so many places I want to take you to, I can't settle for just one\!  
**Ellen:** Hmm, hm hm hm hm hmm\~. Hm hm hm hmhm, hmm\~\! ...It's done\!  
**Ellen:** It sure comes out differently after you've seen it firsthand\! Okay then... Now to upload\!  
**Comment 1:** This week it's the tanuki's big adventure?  
**Ellen:** ...So making a manga didn't work either? I thought I drew it pretty well too...  
**???:** I don't know if it's a tanuki or what, but I really like how that little guy worked so hard to beat the aradama.  
**Ellen:** Ah......\!  
**Ellen:** I-I've done it----------\!  
**Ellen:** I-I've done it----------\!  
**Kaoru:** Seriously, if she's drawing a manga, she could've just said so. Right?  
**Nene:** Nene\!  
**Ellen:** Kaoru-\! Come over here for a minute-\!  
**Kaoru:** What do you want; it's late. I was going to bed, y'know?  
**Ellen:** This is a huge deal\!  
**Kaoru:** Can you believe her...?  
**Kaoru:** Nn?  
**Comment:** The art's not great, but I like it a lot too.  
**Kaoru:** ...Dang. Guess I didn't have to go and do that after all.  
**Nene:** Ne-\!

## [Furisode 21 - Hiyori: Start]: Picking Out Furisode
**Hiyori:** You know... It's crazy how many furisode there are.  
**Ellen:** Keep the praise coming, Hiyoyon\! I worked hard to get all these together\!  
**Hiyori:** I wasn't really meaning to praise you; it's just impressive seeing this many laid out.  
**Ellen:** Ehh, you weren't giving me compliments-?  
**Kaoru:** Do we really owe you compliments for this-?  
**Kaoru:** You're the one who was acting all spoiled saying we all had to wear furisode.  
**Ellen:** You're such a meanie, Kaoru. It's the cute kind of spoiled, isn't it?  
**Kaoru:** The number of furisode you got goes way past cute into freaky.  
**Kanami:** Come on, Kaoru-chan.  
**Kanami:** This really is amazing, Ellen-chan\! There's so many cute ones; I'll have a hard time picking just one\!  
**Kanami:** Did you already decide on one, Hiyori-chan, Kaoru-chan?  
**Kaoru:** Yeah; there's not that many that fit me after all.  
**Hiyori:** For me... Alright, I'll go with this one. I like these more subdued colors.  
**Ellen:** Nice going Hiyoyon, picking that one out\!  
**Kaoru:** Yeah, I think you've got pretty good taste too.  
**Hiyori:** Y-You think so?  
**Ellen:** Yes\! Out of all the furisode here, that one's the most expensive\!  
**Hiyori:** Huh?  
**Hiyori:** ...B-By the way, just how much did it cost...?  
**Ellen:** [whisper whisper whisper]...  
**Hiyori:** Seriously\!?  
**Kanami:** Uwah\!? Eh? How much was it\!?  
**Hiyori:** ...You're better off not knowing, Kanami. I'm picking something else, Ellen.  
**Kaoru:** Was it really that much...?  
**Kaoru:** I'm getting scared to actually pick one of these...  
**Kanami:** Now I have to know\! Tell it to me, Ellen-chan\!  
**Hiyori:** Don't, Kanami\! You're going to regret hearing it\!  
**Ellen:** [whisper whisper whisper]...  
**Kanami:** ......I shouldn't have asked.  
**Hiyori:** That's what I told you...  
**Hiyori:** But still, we have to choose one of these to wear... Let's pick one and be prepared for the worst, Kanami\!  
**Kanami:** Yeah, Hiyori-chan\!  
**Ellen:** Hahaha\! This is fun, Kaoru\!  
**Kaoru:** Only for you, maybe.  

## [Furisode 21 - Hiyori: End]: Is Winter a Special Case?
**Hiyori:** ...It's completely packed here.  
**Kaoru:** Geh, are we seriously getting in that line? Who knows how many hours it'll be before we make it to the shrine.  
**Ellen:** We'd be spending a whole lot of time doing nothing, wouldn't we.  
**Kanami:** Then... How about we do our own thing until the line gets shorter?  
**Kaoru:** Sure, that should be fine.  
**Ellen:** If that's what we're doing, lets go draw our fortunes, Kaoru\!  
**Kaoru:** Hang on; don't drag me\!  
**Ellen:** Let's go\!  
**Hiyori:** That's them gone.  
**Kanami:** Yeah. We should...  
**Kanami:** Sorry, that's Mai-chan calling.  
**Hiyori:** (So, now that we have some free time, what should we do? Ellen and Kaoru went off to get their fortunes...)  
**Kanami:** Okay. Then, I'll see you later.  
**Kanami:** I told Mai-chan we'll meet up with her later.  
**Hiyori:** Oh. Then, what are we doing now?  
**Kanami:** I dunno...  
**Kanami:** Ah.  [Kanami's stomach rumbles]  
**Hiyori:** Guess we're going with that.  
**Hiyori:** Takoyaki, yakisoba, and... There's lots of different stalls set up. What do you want, Kanami?  
**Kanami:** Mmm, I'm not sure... I think I want to have takoyaki. Steamy hot takoyaki\! I'll be right back\!  
**Hiyori:** That's her gone too.  
**Hiyori:** Fine; what should I have? I'm not really in the mood for takoyaki or yakisoba...  
**Hiyori:** Nn? They have an ice cream stand? It's the middle of winter; there's some strange people out there...  
**Hiyori:** That's--\!\!  
**Kanami:** I'm back-... Wait, Hiyori-chan, why'd you get ice cream? And it's chocolate mint too...  
**Hiyori:** Th-They were selling it, so what's wrong with that\!?  
**Kanami:** Well, there's nothing wrong with it... Anyway, let's eat\!  
**Kanami:** Mmm, it's hot and tasty\!  
**Hiyori:** This chocolate mint is cool and tasty too.  
**Kanami:** It's crunchy on the outside\! And gooey on the inside\! The octopus is so tender, Hiyori-chan\!  
**Hiyori:** You can really taste the chocolate mint in this.  
**Kanami:** ...Want one of mine?  
**Hiyori:** I-I'm not being stubborn here\! It really is delicious\!  
**Hiyori:** It's just...  
**Kanami:** Just?  
**Hiyori:** I'm feeling colder, so I'll take one.  
**Kanami:** Sure\!

## [Taisho Romance Military Uniform - Yui: Start]: Click\!
**Yui:** ............  
**Yui:** I wish the whole investigation team would cosplay for me...  
**Kiyoka:** ...What are you saying now?  
**Yui:** Kiyoka-chan\!  
**Yui:** I'm going on a journey\! And, I'm going to find cosplay that everybody'll look good in\!  
**Kiyoka:** ...You don't have to come back, Yui-chan.  
**Yui:** And so, I set out on my journey to search for cosplay\!  
**Yui:** Just wait, Kiyoka-chan\! I'll make sure to find the very best cosplay for you\!  
**Yui:** Hmh\!? My hot girl-dar is picking something up\! That's...  
**Aoto Hina:** ...  
**Yui:** Heyyy\! Hina-saaan\! Where are you going-\!  
**Hina:** Ah, Yui-chan\! Rare to see you around here.  
**Hina:** Need something from our place? Pa should be in right about now...  
**Yui:** Ah; it's not like that\! I'm actually on a journey to find cosplay the investigation team'll look great in\!  
**Hina:** ...Ah, i-is that why. I'm making a delivery to an important customer, so I don't think I'll be much help with that...  
**Yui:** That's... a cool looking sword you have there. Ah, but, there's no edge to it... Is it a fake?  
**Hina:** Yep; it's a prop for a movie they're shooting.  
**Yui:** A MOVIE\!?  
**Yui:** It all sorta just clicked for me\! Is it okay if I go along with you for that\!?  
**Hina:** Probably, but... I'm going to check with them just to be sure, so give me a sec.  
**Yui:** Okay\!  
**Yui:** This is it--------\!\! Please give me these costumes\!\!  
**Director:** ......I said she could come because she's a friend of yours, Hina-chan, but...  
**Hina:** ...I'm sorry. She's not a bad girl... Just a weird one.  
**Director:** You're telling me... Err, what do you want these costumes for?  
**Yui:** There's people I want to put them on\! Like, Mirja-san and Chie-san'd look absolutely perfect in it\!  
**Director:** I see... In that case, what about this. If they help out with the filming, I'll let them wear those clothes.  
**Director:** How does that sound?  
**Yui:** We'll help-\!\!  

## [Taisho Romance Military Uniform - Yui: End]: There's No Moe\!
**Yui:** Please, Mirja-san\! Chie-san\! Help film this movie with me\!  
**Chie:** Mmm... Sorry, Yui-chan. I have coursework I have to take care of.  
**Mirja:** Now would be difficult for me as well. Please ask someone else to help.  
**Yui:** That's a shame... Even if I wanted to find other people...  
**Kiyoka:** Ugh... D-Don't tell me...  
**Yui:** Sorry, Kiyoka-chan... I want a grown up onee-san girl in those clothes\! It wouldn't work for you\!  
**Kiyoka:** I-I'm saved... but, I'm not satisfied with why\!\!  
**Yui:** Hmm...  
**Yui:** Onee-sans that could hold a candle to Mirja-san and Chie-san... Can I find anybody like that...  
**Yui:** THERE THEY ARE\!\!  
**Ellen:** Tadaaah\! Well; how do I look?  
**Akira:** I put it on, 'cause you were saying I had to... Does this actually look any good on me?  
**Yui:** You two look fantastic\! This is it, right here\! This is what I wanted to see\!  
**Yui:** Ahh, it's too much, seriously too much... I'm about to get a nosebleed...  
**Hina:** UWAH-\!? Not about to; there's blood pouring out\!? Here, c'mon and lie down here, before it gets on your costume\!  
**Yui:** Th-Thank you very mush...  
**Yui:** Ah, Hina-san's thighs... I could die happy laying on these...  
**Hina:** Quit being silly; let's get your nosebleed to stop. Filming's going to start soon.  
**Yui:** Shure... I found heaven here...  
**Ellen:** Now I've made my film debut\!  
**Akira:** Debut? We just got total side roles. Is it really worth celebrating that much?  
**Ellen:** You should celebrate too, Inagon\!  
**Yui:** She's right\! You two looked amazing cosplaying\!  
**Akira:** Hah? What do you mean? You're the one who looked way better than us.  
**Yui:** ...Huh?  
**Ellen:** I agree with Inagon. I think the director wanted to make you an extra after seeing you, Yuiyui.  
**Yui:** Sigh... That director sure has some strange sensibilities.  
**Yui:** I mean, I did think I looked alright in it, but I'm not feeling any moe from my own cosplay\!  
**Yui:** I really just want somebody to cosplay for me\!  
**Akira:** I was giving you a compliment... Guess it's no use with you.  
**Ellen:** Though, that's just what I'd expect from Yuiyui.
