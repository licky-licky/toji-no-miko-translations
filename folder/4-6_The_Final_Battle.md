## 1: Mihono Arrives
**Kaoru:** In the end, we couldn't go along with them...  
**Nene:** Ne-...  
**Sayaka:** Fourth level jin'i...  
**Ellen:** But you managed to keep up until third level jin'i, Saaya. That's amazing.  
**Mai:** Kanami-chan, Hiyori-chan, Yukari-sama... Please be...  
**Mihono:** --I made it\! The roof\! Where's Tagitsuhime\!?  
**Mai:** Eh... Mihono-chan\!?  
**Mihono:** Ah-\! Mai\! And Itomi-san, Ellen-san, and Kaoru-san\!  
**Mihono:** Hey, what's going on now\!?  
**Sayaka:** Hiyori is fighting Tagitsuhime, in the threshold of the netherworld.  
**Kaoru:** And probably Kanami and Origami Yukari are too.  
**Ellen:** As they kept raising the level of their jin'i, we got left behind...  
**Mihono:** Nnng, alright... I don't get it at all\!  
**Mihono:** Anyway, I'm going on after them, okay\!  
**Mihono:** Eh-\!? Hang on, Mihono-chan\!?  
**Kaoru:** Hold it\! You can't get to where Tagitsuhime is now. You can't use fourth level jin'i, can you?  
**Mihono:** Ugh... Can't I make it if I try really hard?  
**Kaoru:** Like that's going to work here...  
**Mihono:** B-But, I have to do something to help here... If I just do nothing, then I'm wasting the chance the rest of the investigation team gave me by sending me ahead...  
**Ellen:** --\!? Everybody\! Yukari-sama is coming back\!  
**Yukari:** ...Grgh\!  
**Mai:** Oh no\!\! She's badly wounded\!\!  
**Yukari:** It missed my vitals. I'm fine.  
**Yukari:** ...\!? Asakura Mihono, you came as well...\!?  
**Yukari:** .........Though, it seems you're too late.  

## 2: Kashuu Kiyomitsu's Will and Destiny
**Mihono:** I'm too late...? But...  
**Yukari:** --Wait, Asakura. Look at the sky.  
**Yukari:** ...This isn't good. Along with the border between this world and the netherworld, Hirukomitama is... drawing much too close to the earth.  
**Mihono:** Hiruko mitama? What's that?  
**Yukari:** Tagitsuhime's true body, left in the netherworld.  
**Mihono:** Ehh-\!? Then, if that falls down to the ground, won't it be really bad\!?  
**Yukari:** Yes... If Tagitsuhime manages to combine with her true body, Hirukomitama, Etou and Juujou will stand no chance. However...  
**Yukari:** More than that, Hirukomitama making landfall is something we must avoid at all costs.  
**Yukari:** Hirukomitama is estimated to be 600 square kilometers... Roughly the same size as the 23 wards of Tokyo.  
**Kaoru:** The same size as the 23 wards of Tokyo\!? Are you sure someone didn't get their math wrong\!?  
**Yukari:** I wish that were the case too. ...When Hirukomitama makes landfall, it will without a doubt mean the world's destruction.  
**Yukari:** If we don't destroy Hirukomitama soon... If we can destroy Hirukomitama, then I'll deal with Tagitsuhime...\!  
**Mai:** -\!? Yukari-sama, you don't mean, you plan to keep fighting\!?  
**Ellen:** That's insane\!\! Look at all the blood coming from your stomach\!\!  
**Sayaka:** I'll go.  
**Kaoru:** I'm going too.  
**Yukari:** ...You two, you must be exhausted by now. Can you still apply utsushi?  
**Kaoru:** No, that's...  
**Sayaka:** I can't use utsushi anymore...  
**Yukari:** Then, I cannot allow you to go. If you cannot apply utsushi... I won't stand helplessly by as more lives are lost in vain.  
**Mihono:** In that case, I'll go\! --Yukari-sama\! I can still use utsushi\! Please let me go\!  
**Yukari:** Asakura... You would...? But, what could you...  
**Mihono:** Where there's a will, there's a way\! ...Kanami's waiting on me-\!\!  
**Mihono:** I need the strength...\! To protect Kanami... The strength to protect everyone\!\! Right now\!\! Right here\!\!  
**Mihono:** Please\! Kiyomitsu\!\!  
**Yukari:** Asakura Mihono... That state you're in...\!?  
**Mihono:** This is the power of me and Kiyomitsu\!  
**Mihono:** Yukari-sama\! Please, leave Hirukomitama to me... To me and Kiyomitsu\!  
**Yukari:** The will of Kashuu Kiyomitsu. And, it's destiny too...  
**Mihono:** I'll win for sure\! I'll beat Hirukomitama, and even Tagitsuhime\! So, please, let me go\!  
**Yukari:** This must be the reason Sana sent you here...  
**Yukari:** --Very well. Asakura Mihono, I leave Hirukomitama to you.  
**Mihono:** Yes ma'am-\!  

## 3: Yume Arrives
**Yukari:** Now, Asakura Mihono, I will briefly explain--  
**Yume:** Here I ammm-\!\! Okay, where could Tagitsuhime be-?  
**Yukari:** --Yume\!?  
**Yume:** Ah-\! Yukari-sama-\!  
**Yume:** --Wait, why are you hurt\!? Where's Tagitsuhime\!?  
**Yukari:** What are you doing here...  
**Yukari:** Yume... Can you use utsushi?  
**Yume:** Huh? Utsushi? Of course I can, but...  
**Yukari:** Then, there's something I want you to do.  
**Yukari:** Go now with Asakura Mihono, into the boundary between this world and the netherworld, and destroy Tagitsuhime's true body, Hirukomitama.  
**Yume:** Destroy Hirukomitama?  
**Yume:** I don't really get it, but is that some kind of super strong enemy that only I can handle?  
**Yukari:** Of course.  
**Yume:** I thought so\! After all, it's Tagitsuhime's true body, right\! It sounds interesting\! I'll do it\!  
**Yume:** It feels like it's finally time for us to break out the secret weapon\!  
**Yukari:** Whatever may happen, do not let your guard down. In both size and strength, Hirukomitama will be no ordinary foe.  
**Yukari:** What's more, this operation comes with a time limit. If you are unable to defeat Hirukomitama before it makes landfall, all will be lost.  
**Yukari:** And, after you have destroyed Hirukomitama, you are to return here at once. Do you understand?  
**Yume:** So, the important bits are, I just have to beat it real quick and come right back, right?  
**Yukari:** Yes. That's all I can ask for. You understand as well, don't you, Asakura?  
**Mihono:** Huh...? But, then, what about Tagitsuhime...  
**Yukari:** I'm telling you, there is no time. We have no choice but to trust Etou and Juujou with Tagitsuhime.  
**Yukari:** Etou and Juujou as they are now will surely destroy Tagitsuhime\! You will fulfill your own role\!  
**Mihono:** I just have to trust Kanami and Juujou-san then... I got it...\!  
**Yume:** Kashuu Kiyomitsu onee-san, don't slow me down out there, okay\!  
**Mihono:** Don't worry about that... Right now, I'm pretty strong too\!  
**Yume:** ...Heh, if you say so\!  
**Mai:** Mihono-chan\! Be careful, will you\!  
**Sayaka:** Do your best.  
**Kaoru:** We're counting on you, Mihono...  
**Nene:** Nenne-\!  
**Ellen:** Please come back safe, no matter what\!  
**Mihono:** Then, I'll be going\!\!  

## 4:　Joint Struggle (1)
**Mihono:** ...This is, the threshold between our world and the netherworld...   
**Yume:** Hey hey, where's that Hirukomitama?  
**Mihono:** I'm not sure, but, Yukari-sama said Hirukomitama should be really big, so we should be able to see it right away...  
**Mihono:** We're running out of time, so let's look for it fast\!  
**Yume:** Hey-, I'm the stronger one here, so don't tell me what to do...  
**Aradama:** --GUUOOOOO\!  
**Yume:** Aradama\!?  
**Mihono:** But we don't have time to deal with all these...\!\!  

## 5: Joint Struggle (2)
**Mihono:** Great-\! My body feels light\! I can cut through the aradama easy\! If I can keep this up, the aradama won't be able to hold us back much at all\!  
**Yume:** I can't believe it-, you weren't lying after all. You really are strong, Onee-san.  
**Yume:** The aradama here are way tougher than the ones on the ground too.  
**Mihono:** Huh...? They are? It didn't feel like it to me...  
**Yume:** I changed my mind a little. When we get back, maybe I'll want to have a match with you.  
**Mihono:** Fine by me\! But, before we can do that, we've gotta beat Hirukomitama\! Let's look for it fast\!  
**Yume:** ...Wait, Onee-san\! --Look over there\! There's something weird\!  
**Mihono:** What is...\!? No wait, that's...\!\!  

## 6: Hirukomitama (1)
**Mihono:** It disappeared\!? What was that just now\!? You saw that weird thing way over there, right\!?  
**Yume:** Onee-san\! Behind you\!\!  
**Hirukomitama:** .........  
**Yume:** What is, that thing\!?  
**Mihono:** Maybe that's part of Hirukomitama...?  
**Yume:** I get it now\! It didn't just disappear... This place, what we're standing on, it's all Hirukomitama, so it can come out wherever it wants\!  
**Mihono:** Hirukomitama\! We're here to destroy you\!  
**Hirukomitama:** .........  
**Yume:** Sorry, but we're in a hurry here. Yukari-sama said we have to come back right away.  
**Mihono:** We're gonna destroy you, to help out Kanami and Juujou-san\!  
**Hirukomitama:** .........  

## 7: Hirukomitama (2)
**Mihono:** What's with this thing... I doesn't feel like I'm doing any damage to it at all\!  
**Hirukomitama:** .........  
**Yume:** What's wrong, Onee-san\! You gonna start crying already\!?  
**Mihono:** I just felt like complaining a little\! This isn't enough for me to give up yet\!  
**Mihono:** No matter how big its true body is, where there's a will, there's a way\!  
**Yume:** I think it might be a while since I've had this much fun\! I'll show you\! More and more, just what makes me so great\!  
**Hirukomitama:** .........  

## 8: Hirukomitama (3)
**Hirukomitama:** .........  
**Yume:** Pant... Pant... Th-That was really tough...  
**Hirukomitama:** .........  
**Mihono:** We did it somehow, but it's still alive\! If we don't finish it off fast--  
**Hirukomitama:** .........  
**Mihono:** Uwah-\!\! No\! No no no-\!\! That's bad...\!  
**Yume:** We're getting blown back to the real world\!  
**Mihono:** Kanami\! Juujou-san\! NOOO----\!\!  

## 9: The Depths of the Netherworld (1)
At that time, the fighting continued between Juujou Hiyori and Tagitsuhime--

  
**Hiyori:** Tagitsuhime...\!  
**Tagitsu:** Heh... So Yukari has returned to your world.  
**Kanami:** --Hiyori-chaaaan\!  
**Tagitsu:** Hm...?  
**Kanami:** Hiyori-chan\!  
**Hiyori:** Kanami\!? How did you manage fourth level jin'i\!?  
**Kanami:** I tried my hardest\! I wanted to catch up to you, Hiyori-chan\!  
**Hiyori:** You tried your hardest...?  
**Hiyori:** Sure... That's about what I expect from you.  
**Kanami:** Hiyori-chan\! Tagitsuhime is...\!  
**Tagitsuhime:** --The time is now. ...Hirukomitama\!\!  
**Hiyori:** Hirukomitama--\!? Don't tell me, she's trying to combine with her true body in the netherworld\!?  
**Hiyori:** ...\!? Something doesn't look right.  
**Tagitsu:** Hmph... It seems we were unable to fully unite.  
**Tagisuhime:** Well, no matter. Come, entertain me.  

## 10: The Depths of the Netherworld (2)
**Tagitsu:** Chidori... Kogarasumaru girl. Yet again, you have made my heart dance.  
**Kanami:** Tagitsuhime's body is...\!\!  
**Hiyori:** She still had strength to spare...?  
**Tagitsu:** You've done well for yourselves. Even with myself united with Hirukomitama... Yet still\!  
**Hiyori:** Let's go, Kanami\! Together, we'll...  
**Kanami:** Yeah\! We'll save Tagitsuhime together\!  
**Hiyori:** Save... her?  
**Kanami:** After all, Tagitsuhime said it again now, didn't she? Her heart was dancing. That means she's having fun, isn't she?  
**Tagitsu:** How peculiar you are. Do you intend to remain locked here in this moment close to eternity, just to entertain me by clashing swords?  
**Kanami:** That's not it; this is for my own enjoyment\! Your swords will teach me it all\! All about you\!  
**Hiyori:** You're saying Tagitsuhime is having fun with this fight...?  
**Kanami:** Yeah\! It's the same for me\! Crossing okatana against okatana, getting to spar with everyone... It's all a conversation happening through our swords\!　  
**Hiyori:** This is a conversation too...? So that's how you treat a sword, Kanami\!  
**Tagitsuhime:** Conversing by sword...?　  
**Hiyori:** Let's go\!  
**Kanami:** Mm\!  
**Tagitsu:** Very well. Entertain me as best you can, with this conversation through sword of yours\!  

## 11: The Depths of the Netherworld (3)
**Tagitsu:** Grg...  
**Hiyori:** ...Sorry, Kanami. I lied to you.  
**Hiyori:** I have to take Tagitsuhime with me now, down to the depths of the netherworld.  
**Kanami:** ...I knew you did.  
**Hiyori:** Oh.  
**Kanami:** That's why... Let's go together.  
**Hiyori:** ...Thank you.  
**Kanami/Hiyori:** --UOOOOOOOO\!\!  

## 12: Seal
**Yume:** Urgh...  
**Mihono:** ...We're, back on the roof...?  
**Mai:** You two\! You made it back okay\!  
**Sayaka:** Thank goodness.  
**Yukari:** You've done well, you two.  
**Yume:** ...Eh? But we didn't finish off Hirukomitama\!  
**Kaoru:** Oi, look up at the sky\! Hirukomitama is going away...  
**Nene:** Ne-...  
**Ellen:** The gate to the netherworld is getting smaller...  
**Yukari:** The gate is closing...\!  
**Mihono:** It's closing...? What does that mean\!? Wait, wait\! What about Kanami and Juujou-san\!?  
**Yukari:** I'm sorry...  
**Mihono:** ...\!\! Was this what you planned... from the start\!?  
**Yukari:** Juujou and Etou... did their duty...  
**Mihono:** Please just wait, Yukari-sama\!\! Kanami and Juujou-san, they can still--\!\!  
**Yukari:** If we don't seal off the netherworld now, it would be a repeat of twenty years ago... Even if I were to devote my entire being as a toji to it\!  
**Mihono:** But, still\! If that's the case, then why did I have to--\!?  
**Yukari:** If you would resent me for this... That's fine\!  
**Yukari:** Grant unto us, in all things, cleansing, purification, of wickedness, sin, and defilement...  
**Yukari:** These wishes we most humbly entreat\!  
**Mihono:** Kanami... Juujou-san...  
**Yukari:** ...Asakura, I'm grateful. Had you not defeated Hirukomitama, I wouldn't have been able to seal off the netherworld.  
**Mihono:** -\!? Th-Then... It's because of me, that Kanami and Juujou-san are...  
**Yukari:** That's not it\! It's because of you that the world was saved.  
**Kaoru:** ...Goddamnit-\!\!  
**Sayaka:** Ahh...  
**Mai:** But...  
**Ellen:** ...Kanamin... Hiyoyon...  
**Chie:** --Everyone\!  
**Mirja:** If the gate to the netherworld has been closed, does that mean Tagitsuhime has been defeated\!?  
**Kofuki:** Oi, Mihocchi\! Looks like you managed to help out some after all\!  
**Kiyoka:** -\!? Yukari-sama is badly hurt\!\!  
**Suzuka:** Yukari-sama-\! I'll call a rescue team straight away\!  
**Suzuka:** For Yukari-sama to be wounded this badly... Still, you safely managed to defeat Tagitsuhime, didn't you?  
**Yui:** ...Uh, I don't see Kanami-chan and Hiyori-chan anywhere. Where did they go?  
**Yume:** Those two, they're...  
**Yukari:** ......  
**Mihono:** ...Kanami... Even though we promised, we'd have a rematch someday...  
**Mihono:** Even though, I never even managed to beat you a single time... I feel like, I might have a chance now... But now... But now\!\!  
**Mihono:** KANAMIIIIIIIIIIII-\!\!\!  
**Other:** Mission Accomplished  
**Sana:** The gate to the netherworld is nearly sealed\! According to observations, its size is minimal\!  
**Yuzuki:** Please, Yukari...\! Keep at it\!  
**Sana:** ......The sealing has been completed\! They did it\!  
**Yuzuki:** Good\! You did a fine job, Yukari\! Our mission is complete\!  
**Toji A:** Asakura and Tsubakuro's vital signs have stabilized\! ......But...  
**Yuzuki:** But, what? What is it\!?  
**Toji A:** ...Etou and Juujous vitals, they haven't returned.  
**Yuzuki:** What does that mean... What's happened to them\!? Confirm the situation, immediately\!
