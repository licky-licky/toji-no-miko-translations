Assemble! Toji Cheer Squad
==========================

## 1: Special Mission Announcement
**Maki:** Are you sure about this, Yukari-sama...? Is there any need for a unit like this...  
**Yukari:** Currently, there is a mixed unit from all the Five Traditions on a mission to investigate the Akabane swords. If all goes well, the number of okatana in our possession should steadily rise from here.  
**Yukari:** In which case, we may find that there aren't enough toji to pair with these okatana.  
**Yukari:** In order to protect the people, the more toji we have, the better. If we use this unit wisely, there's a chance it will increase the number of toji applicants.  
**Maki:** Still...  
**Yukari:** Do you disapprove? Maki.  
**Maki:** ......  
**Maki:** No. If you make the order, Yukari-sama, I will use all the power given to the elite guard to fulfill it. I have no complaints.  
**Yukari:** Good. Then, begin at once.  
**Maki:** Understood. I will prepare a unit capable of accomplishing this mission. The Special Ritual Riot Squad Distinguished Publicity Unit--  
**Maki:** Hereby known as, the Toji Cheer Squad\!\!  
**Takatsu Yukina:** Just now, Yukari-sama sent an order down to each of the Five Traditions. A toji from each school will undergo a selection exam to take part in a unit undergoing a special mission.  
**Yukina:** Sayaka, you are my masterpiece. This is a chance to prove the vast difference between you and these other toji.  
**Yukina:** Pass their selection, and be acknowledged by Yukari-sama.  
**Sayaka:** I will. This special mission... What is it about?  
**Yukina:** Cheerleading.  
**Sayaka:** ............Cheer leading?  
**Maki:** Has everyone arrived?  
**Ellen:** Yes\! Everyone's here\!  
**Naruse Miki:** Though everyone is just the five of us, isn't it\~?  
**Yui:** I'm here, I'm here\! When I heard they wanted someone for such a delicious event, I threw both my hands up\!  
**Mai:** Ah, you're here too, Sayaka-chan?  
**Sayaka:** Mm. President Takatsu ordered me to be here.  
**Maki:** Osafune's Kohagura Ellen, Heijou's Naruse Miki, Ayanokouji's Yamashiro Yui, Minoseki's Yanase Mai, Renpu's Itomi Sayaka--  
**Maki:** So you five are each school's nominees.  
**Ellen:** Makimaki? What are the five of us going to be doing here? We came all the way to this inn out in the mountains.  
**Maki:** You should have heard; all of you are applicants nominated to join the Toji Cheer Squad.  
**Maki:** In order to advertise the position of toji, this squad will improve our image.  
**Maki:** As this is a direct proposal from Yukari-sama, I won't accept any half-hearted effort. You'll acquire the skills necessary to put on the perfect cheerleading performance.  
**Maki:** To make that happen, you'll now be participating in a special cheerleading training camp\!  
**Yui:** Camp\! So I'll be camping under the same roof with all these cuties...\!  
**Yui:** Ahh, I-I'm not sure I'll be able to control myself\! I'll apologize in advance\! If anything happens, sorry\!  
**Maki:** If anything happens... Like what, exactly?  
**Miki:** I think it's best not to pry into that. At least, that's what my intuition's telling me.  
**Maki:** Hm... Well, fine.  
**Maki:** One week from now, Yukari-sama herself will be coming to inspect your performances.  
**Maki:** If she approves of you, only then will you be officially accepted into the Toji Cheer Squad.  
**Ellen:** This sounds like fun. If we're going to do it, we might as well give it our best shot\!  
**Miki:** Though, cheerleading doesn't exactly sound like a toji's work, does it...  
**Maki:** Naruse Miki. This was a direct order from Yukari-sama herself. I won't allow you to take it lightly.  
**Miki:** I-I understand that\~. So please stop glaring at me..  
**Sayaka:** ...I'll do my best.  
**Maki:** Good. Starting now, all of you should aim to become the ultimate cheerleaders\!  

## 2: Cheerleaders, in Training\!
**Maki:** We'll start with your stamina\! Run for one hour through the mountains. Afterwards, we'll do squats, sit ups, and push ups.  
**Miki:** Pant\~ pant\~... Why... Are we doing something so sporty...?  
**Ellen:** Cheerleading works as a sort of endurance match too\!  
**Sayaka:** I'll do my best.  
**Maki:** Next you'll be learning the fundamental techniques. Beginning with stunts, and then forming a pyramid\!  
**Mai:** Stunts...?  
**Maki:** Stunts are a part of the act as a cheerleader. A pyramid is made up of a combination of stunts. Now, let's get started\!  
**Miki:** Th-This got hard all of a sudden...  
**Sayaka:** I'll do my best.  
And so their practicing continued... After several days passed...

  
**Maki:** Jump, step, watch those feet\! Focus\!  
**Maki:** Good, stop. You all seem like you're getting used to this.  
**Ellen:** I could do this much before breakfast\!  
**Maki:** Though-- Itomi Sayaka. Your movements are perfect, but there's still a stiffness that you can't get rid of.  
**Sayaka:** Stiffness...?  
**Maki:** According to my cheerleading textbook, showing emotion through your expression is essential... You need to work on that from now on.  
**Sayaka:** ...  
**Yui:** Who wants to get in the bath with me\!? The bath\! We should all take a bath, you know\! Have to take one right away\!  
**Miki:** Why are you still so worked up...?  
**Sayaka:** ...  
**Mai:** What's wrong, Sayaka-chan? You look down.  
**Sayaka:** Shidou Maki told me before... I can't get rid of my stiffness.  
**Sayaka:** I thought I was doing everything right. But, I'm missing something... I don't know what to do.  
**Mai:** We all only just started cheerleading. I don't think you should worry about it so much.  
**Sayaka:** But President Takatsu said I have to get Origami Yukari's acknowledgement and become a cheer toji. I have to do my best...  
**Mai:** Sayaka-chan...  
**Mai:** I know\! In that case, why not get some pointers from someone more skilled? You might learn something useful.  
The next day--

  
**Sayaka:** Shidou Maki. Please teach me some pointers.  
**Mai:** Sayaka-chan is worried... She wants to hear some advice from you.  
**Maki:** ...Sorry. I don't know anything about cheerleading myself, so I can't teach you anything that's not in the textbook...  
**Miki:** Eh-\! Is that true\!?  
**Yui:** That won't do\~. If you want to teach someone, you have to be able to do it yourself\!  
**Yui:** Ahh, seeing Shidou-san dancing around cheerleading... I'd pay to see that\! In fact, I need to see it, pant, pant...\!  
**Maki:** No, I'm not going to be one of the cheer toji; I'm just your coach and judge... There's no need for a coach to master the sport.  
**Ellen:** Makimaki, there's a phone call for you.  
**Maki:** ...For some reason... I have a strong feeling that I shouldn't answer this...  
**Suzuka:** Hello, Maki-san?  
**Maki:** Yes. What's going on, Suzuka.  
**Suzuka:** Yukari-sama asked me to pass along a message to you just now.  
**Suzuka:** "I forgot to mention this, but you're also assigned to participate as a member of the cheer toji." ...Is the message she left me.  
**Maki:** What... Did you say...\!?  
**Yui:** Hooray-\! Now Shidou-san has no choice but to be a cheerleader with us\!  
**Maki:** Kh...\!  
**Sayaka:** ...Shidou Maki wasn't a cheerleading expert... Who else knows how...?  
**Mai:** What about Naruse-san and Yamashiro-san?  
**Miki:** Eh, you want me to teach you? I'm hardly any better.  
**Yui:** I've been too busy watching the other girls cheering with all they've got, so I'm not that confident in my own skills.  
**Mai:** Then that leaves... Ellen-chan?  
**Ellen:** Hm? You need me?  
**Ellen:** Yeah, yeah, yeah\! Finish\!  
**Mai:** Wow, Ellen-chan, your cheering is so good\!  
**Ellen:** Fu fu fu\! America is the home of cheerleading, after all\! Of course I'm good at it\!  
**Sayaka:** I don't think that's the reason though... But Ellen is the best.  
**Sayaka:** Ellen, teach me the techniques for cheerleading.  
**Mai:** And I'll practice with you. If that's alright with you, Ellen-chan.  
**Ellen:** It's okay\! Just leave it to me\!  

## 3: Final Exam
And so, after several days--

  
**Ellen:** Right, left, right, left, do a spin, and jump\!  
**Sayaka:** ...I did it.  
**Mai:** I think I did it right too.  
**Ellen:** Excellent\! You two are in perfect sync.  
**Ellen:** And you, Saaya, your stiffness from before is gone\! Very good\!  
**Sayaka:** Thank you. It's because you taught me.  
**Ellen:** Non non, Saaya. I didn't do anything.  
**Sayaka:** But you're the one who taught me how to get better.  
**Ellen:** You've always been so physically fit, Saaya, so your cheerleading techniques were already perfect.  
**Ellen:** But your expression was too stiff. You looked like a beautiful doll, being puppeteered around...  
**Sayaka:** I did...?  
**Ellen:** But when you were with Maimai, you were making such a happy face. So Maimai is actually the reason you're doing better\!  
**Ellen:** If you want to thank anyone, you should be thanking her.  
**Sayaka:** I see... Mai, thank you.  
**Mai:** Eh\!? I-I didn't do anything though.  
**Ellen:** Ahaha, looks like Maimai's the perfect medicine for Saaya after all\!  
**Ellen:** When you two were cheering just now, you were so coordinated you looked like sisters\!  
**Sayaka:** If Mai were my sister... That wouldn't be bad.  
**Mai:** S-Sayaka-chan\!?  
**Maki:** Today marks the end of the training camp. Finally, Yukari-sama herself will be judging all of you. If she approves, you will be officially admitted into the Toji Cheer Squad.  
**Yukari:** This is an official mission you have been assigned as toji. Show me your fullest potential, the same as you would if you were suppressing aradama.  
**Ellen:** Are you going to be cheering too, Makimaki?  
**Maki:** I've been practicing every waking moment since then... As a member of the elite guard, failure here isn't an option.  
**Yukari:** Now then, one by one, show me your performances as a cheerleader.  
**Yukari:** Good, Naruse Miki. You pass.  
**Miki:** Thank you very much.  
**Miki:** Phew\~, thank goodness\~. If you want to stand out, you can't wait for others to go ahead of you.  
**Yukari:** Yamashiro Yui, pass.  
**Yui:** Yes, I did it\! I had to make it into this unit to be around those cute cheerleaders, after all\!  
**Yukari:** Kohagura Ellen, pass.  
**Ellen:** Of course\!  
**Yukari:** Shidou Maki, pass. That was a good performance.  
**Maki:** Thank you very much.  
**Yukari:** ...If only I'd brought Suzuka here to see this.  
**Maki:** P-Please don't joke like that, Yukari-sama\!  
**Yukari:** Yanase Mai, pass.  
**Mai:** Phew... Thank you very much.  
**Yukari:** Lastly... Itomi Sayaka.  
**Sayaka:** Yes.  
**Yukari:** (Her expression is stiff. This type of role might not be suited for Itomi Sayaka...)  
**Mai:** Sayaka-chan, relax your shoulders. I'll be here with you.  
**Sayaka:** Mai... Mm, okay.  
**Yukari:** (...Hm. She was able to relax herself when she needed to.)  
**Sayaka:** --Finish.  
**Yukari:** Good. Itomi Sayaka, you pass.  
**Sayaka:** Good...  
**Mai:** You did it, Sayaka-chan\!  
**Sayaka:** Mm. Thank you, Mai.  
**Yukari:** All of you passed. You've done well, putting on these performances after such a short period of time.  
**Yukari:** Now then... In the coming days, you'll have your final practical test.  

## 4: Formation of the Toji Cheer Squad
**Ellen:** So our final test is putting us in actual combat\!  
**Maki:** Recently, there's been a number of reports of aradama appearing around this stadium.  
**Maki:** If aradama appear while a game is taking place, a significant number of people in the stadium could be in danger.  
**Sayaka:** If aradama do appear, we need to defeat them right away...  
**Maki:** That's how it is. For that reason, the Toji Cheer Squad will be standing by here in the stadium.  
**Miki:** On top of that, even though we're meant to be cheer toji, we're still wearing our ordinary uniforms, aren't we?  
**Yui:** Sighhh\~... What a letdown... I was so looking forward to everyone dressing up like cheerleaders.  
**Mai:** Ahaha... Still, I'm sort of relieved. It would be a little embarrassing fighting wearing something like that...  
**Maki:** That's for sure...  
**Sayaka:** --\! The spectrum finder is detecting something...\!  
**Maki:** Looks like the aradama are already here. Let's go\!  
**Suzuka:** Stop right there\!  
**Ellen:** Oh, Hanahana, are you our backup?  
**Suzuka:** I'm only here to deliver these clothes. The finishing touches took longer than expected, but here you are: the official uniforms of the Special Ritual Riot Squad Distinguished Publicity Unit.  
**Maki:** What... Are these...\!?  
**Ellen:** WOW\! Real cheerleader uniforms\!  
**Sayaka:** Mm...  
**Mai:** This is what cheerleaders have to wear, is it...  
**Yui:** Yessssss\!\! Cheerleader uniforms for everyone\! I can't believe my eyes\!  
**Miki:** Don't get too excited...  
**Suzuka:** You'll carry out your mission while wearing these, everyone.  
**Suzuka:** And Yukari-sama has asked me to remind you to do your cheerleading performance after you're done fighting.  
Several days later--

  
**Kanami:** Check it out, Mai-chan, Sayaka-chan\! They put up a video of the cheer toji on the internet\!  
**Sayaka:** It's true.  
**Mai:** So they recorded it after all... When we were fighting wearing that.  
**Sayaka:** The number of views... Is a lot. It's over one million.  
**Mai:** They said cheerleading would improve our image and make others want to join... But is this really going to make more girls want to be toji...?  
**Kanami:** I'm sure it will\! I mean, see how cute you all look\!  
**Kanami:** Oh, see, this is the part where you and Sayaka-chan started cheering after beating that aradama.  
**Sayaka:** ...Mm, I get it.  
**Mai:** ? What do you mean, Sayaka-chan?  
**Sayaka:** I... Had more fun than I thought.  
**Sayaka:** (I'm glad I was able to do what President Takatsu asked me to... But, doing it with my friends... Was a little fun too.)
