This is a school event, so you would cause the whole group to become disorganized.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> I wasn't serious! What were you, on the student council in a past life, in the morals committee now, and shooting for class president in the next one!?  
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That's rude, Kofuki-san! Though, I don't really understand what you're saying!?  
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> It's not rude, you got it all wrong, Kiyoka. I'm just looking out for Mai.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> If somebody doesn't say something, she's gonna turn into another Chichie.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> But Chie-san is a wonderful person... Actually, I'd be glad to be more like her?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Hmm. Well you're already growing into the part, so you might as well act like it, huh.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Growing into...... Hey!? Where are you looking!!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Ahahahahaha!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> But you know, I've gotta keep screwing around to put up with this. This dumbass game training.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> We didn't do this last year, so whose bright idea was it this time?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I don't think it's as absurd as you're making it out to be.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Really? I mean, the whole Five Traditions made this game center, but it doesn't even have rhythm or fighting games? What're we doing there then?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That's true... All it's meant to have are slot machines, roulette tables, and playing cards, right?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> They think we're gonna play cards against aradama-chan or something?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> When it comes to cards, it takes concentration to recognize a chance and take it, and good judgment to decide whether to call or draw. That might be what they want us improving...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> With slot machines, they could improve our perception, and with the others, I'm sure there's a good reason they have these games for our training.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Now that I think about it... Game training does sound like it could help a lot with being a toji, Kofuki-san.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> But you're not gonna kill an aradama-chan with cards.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...Fufu, that's very like you.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...This place sure is huge.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I heard they built it specifically for this training, but... It certainly has the right atmosphere.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> For sure.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> That's enough talking!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> The explanation of your game training is about to begin.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> First off, forget everything you imagined when you think of the word "game".<br><strong>Maki:</strong> This is toji training, as true as any other.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Will we be required to play all these games?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> That isn't the case.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> You can choose to play games for one person, or more competitive games. So long as you can win points.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> However, I will say this: competitive games will be much more efficient at that.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Those who fail will face extra lessons, continuing their training until they've made up for all the points they couldn't collect.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> And afterwards, they'll be cleaning this facility.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> (I wonder if they're already testing our judgment from the games we choose...)<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> (Cleaning too... I don't want to have to take extra lessons... What will Kofuki-san and Yanase-san choose to do...?)<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Yawn... This is taking forever.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> K-Kofuki-san! You shouldn't yawn in front of them!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> You realize, it's too late to be giving her that advice.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Shichinosato Kofuki...? Is our explanation boring you?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Duh. This'd put anybody to sleep.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> (Ahh! Kofuki-san! You can't talk to them like that...!)  
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Maki-san. It seems our explanation is unnecessary, so why don't we begin?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> I agree, Suzuka. In that case... Everyone, your training starts now!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> At least they didn't get mad...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> I wouldn't lose my temper over something like that, Musumi Kiyoka.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Still, Shichinosato Kofuki. I'll be watching you carefully during this training. And whether you'll be able to take this seriously.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> She has her eye on you now...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...Seems like it. Sigh, this couldn't be easy.  </p><h2 id="2-cheating" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>2: Cheating!?</h2><p><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> The training's started... I'm already nervous...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Yes, the mood in here is a little overwhelming.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Let's see... Looking around, more went to try the roulette and slot machines than play cards... Right?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Rather than relying on strategy, they probably decided luck based games would be more reliable at gathering points...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> U-Um! What are.... You two going to do?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Since concentration, judgment, and strategy seem important to this training, I think I'll go with cards?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> We came here together, so why don't we all play together too?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah! Okay! Let's all play together!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Pass. Strategy's not my thing.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I figured...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I understand. Then, good luck.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> So, now what...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> What will you do?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Huh? Why're you following me?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I won't ask you to let me join you. But please, let me hang behind you and watch!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> I don't really care, but... Why?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Well... It's so tense in here, it's making me uncomfortable... I'd be scared by myself...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Hmmm. Well, that's how you are, I guess.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> But don't come crying to me if you end up in makeup lessons, got it?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I won't!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Alright, time to get started.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> With the slot machines?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Yep, these look like the easiest way is all. You push here to start, huh...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It's my first time seeing a slot machine, but... They spin so fast, don't they?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> But that's all there is to it; you just push the buttons at the right time. Anyway, let's watch the points roll on in.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Ughhhh, I'm already bored. Kiyoka, you know any tricks to this?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You're asking me for help, Kofuki-san!?  
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Just give me a moment, please! I'll do my best to think of something!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> S-Sure. I didn't think you were so into this...?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Oh right... I read in a book once about someone who could focus their eyes right, keep track of the slots, and match them up!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Focus your eyes right... It's too blurry to see though? They must've had some crazy perceptive vision.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> It might interest you to know that these slot machines have been uniquely modified for this training. Ordinary machines are much slower.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> For training...?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You mean, so it would be harder to follow with your eyes...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> In order to train your kinetic vision, of course.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> That's playing dirty.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Will you continue with the slots, or will you give up? It all depends on your judgment.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> The way they're acting is pissing me off. I'll try using jin'i, for now.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Just gotta get my okatana, and... Here goes nothing.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Still a little fast, but... I can see it.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> That, should, do it.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That's amazing! You got triple 7s, Kofuki-san!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> I heard the cheat detector go off, and look who it is.... Shichinosato Kofuki.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Huh? I wasn't cheating though? Right?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> R-Right. Kofuki-san is innocent.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Come on... You used jin'i, didn't you? In this training, that's forbidden.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Are you serious...?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> So what happens if I cheated? Are you kicking me out?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> What good would kicking you out of training do? No, until this exercise is over, you'll be competing with me.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> This is the worst...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Follow me, Shichinosato Kofuki.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> We're joining you here.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Oh, that's fine. ...Wait, Shidou-san, and Shichinosato-san too? Why are you two together?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> I wouldn't be if I could help it.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> You take a seat too, Musumi Kiyoka.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah, I-I'll just stay over here! I'm only here to cheer on Kofuki-san, so...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Then you're not training anything. Sit down.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> U-Understood...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> (Why did this have to happen... There's no way I can do this all of a sudden...)<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Now then, are you familiar with blackjack?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Nope, not at all. Never heard the name either.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> ...I see, that's good to know. I'll have to explain the rules then.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> For starters, the blackjack you'll be playing here has one key difference from ordinary blackjack.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Which is, the players will get to make their decisions while the dealer's hole card is shown.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> If I don't know what it's normally like, that doesn't mean anything. How's that any different from normal?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> It's an adjustment so, even if you're unfamiliar with the rules, if you're astute enough you should be able to win.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Hmm, so it's like a handicap for us?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> You can think of it like that.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> As for the goal of the game, you're trying to get the cards in your hand to add up to 21.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Huh? Where's the fun in that?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> That's just how the game works. I'll go on.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> In the case that you go over 21, that's called going bust, at which point you've lost.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> As you might guess, the 2 through 10 cards are worth the same number value. Face cards are worth 10. The ace is either 1 or 11; you get to pick.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> At the start, the dealer will give you 2 cards. The dealer will also draw 2 for themselves, but only 1 of theirs will be face up.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Why'd they have to go and make this even more complicated. What's wrong with showing all of them?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> I told you, didn't I? This is the part of the rules we changed. During the games here, you'll get to see both of the dealer's cards from the beginning.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> While playing blackjack, there are 2 choices the players can make:<br><strong>Maki:</strong> They can hit, drawing another card. Or they can stand, if they think they can win with their current hand.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> As for more in depth rules...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Aghh, I get it already! This is boring! There's hit, there's stand, and you add up to 21. That's enough, right?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> If you're fine with that. Then, let's play blackjack.<br>--Ten minutes later.</p><p><strong>Dealer:</strong> Hole card, open. The dealer's cards reach 20.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> 20, huh... I'm at 18, and the odds of getting a 3 are... Well, I don't think there's any helping me here.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> It's my loss.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Oh, Mai's giving up. What about you, Kiyoka?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I-I'm also at 18 too, so I...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Will you forfeit too, Musumi Kiyoka?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I-I'll hit... A 4... Ahh, I went bust...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> So Kiyoka's busted.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> And I'm at 19 here. I'm not gonna win like this, so now what? Think I can get a 2...?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> I'm also at 19, but this is no time to hesitate, Shichinosato Kofuki. This is where your judgment is tested... Hit!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Huhh!? At least think about it first!?  
<strong>Maki:</strong> No matter how much you worry, the cards won't change. I drew a 2... That makes 21, blackjack.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> And what will you do?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Like I'm backing down! I'll hit, okay! Gimme a 2! A 2! A 2! 2!<br><strong>Dealer:</strong> 5... 24 in total. Shichinosato-sama has gone bust.  </p><h2 id="3-kofukis-revenge" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>3: Kofuki's Revenge</h2><p><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I'm at 13, and the dealer has 16... I know I won't get a 7 though... I-I give up...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Kiyoka, you're looking pretty pale? You feeling alright?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...Y-Yes. I'll be fine... I think.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> You don't have to force yourself, okay? Take a break if it's too much.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Now, here's my problem. The dealer's at 16, but I've got 15... I just need anything between a 1 and a 6, come on! Hit!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...10! I went bust again!!?  
<strong>Mai:</strong> I have 15 as well... I'll stand.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> 15's not gonna win you anything though?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Actually, I'll be fine with this.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Don't blame me when you lose... So, what've you got?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> 18. I'll show you my focus and judgment in action once again, Shichinosato Kofuki.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> So long as I get a 3, I'll have blackjack. So... Hit.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> 3, and that's blackjack.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> What was I supposed to learn from that!? No matter how you spin it, it's all luck! If I was lucky too, I'd have won just like that!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Get a hold of yourself, Shichinosato Kofuki. Think of the purpose of this training.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> I know already! We've gotta get points!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> I'll take that as a "I don't know."  You should go cool off for a while.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Cool off, my ass! Whose fault do you think it is I'm getting pissed here!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...Kofuki-san.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Huh?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> This is... It's too much for me. It's too scary, playing these games together...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> I mean, you sure are on a losing streak. Well, I'm not doing any better I guess.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...Kofuki-san, I think you're getting too carried away with Shidou-san.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> If you weren't always aiming for 21, you'd win more, I think... The opposite of me...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...You're awesome.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Eh?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> You've got an eye for this stuff!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Y-You think so?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> What else? Did you figure out anything else?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah, umm, let's see...... I'm sorry. I'm just an amateur, so I'm not really sure...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Nah, that's more than enough. I think blackjack might be your game, Kiyoka.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> My game...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> U-Um! I think I'll give it another try!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Sure? Nobody's stopping you.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Okay! And also, I sort of thought of something... Why don't we ask Yanase-san to teach us her technique?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> You want me to teach you how I play blackjack?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I don't mind helping you one bit, but... I'm only a beginner, you know?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> But you won with that 15 before.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> That's because there's a trick to the dealer... I figured out something like a hidden rule.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> A hidden rule?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> In all the time we've been playing, the dealer will never stand when they're at 16 or under.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> The lowest I saw it happen was 17.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> They didn't?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Yes. That's why, it simplifies your chances in that case. If the dealer's hand is below 16, you should stand.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> The dealer can't stand unless they're at 17 or greater. In other words, they must hit for at least another card.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Oh, I get it. It means there's a good chance the dealer'll go bust.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> The most important factor is the dealer's cards.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> The one you're facing off against isn't Shidou-san or I, but the dealer instead.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> The dealer, huh... Thanks, Mai. This is where our comeback starts, Kiyoka!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> L-Let's give it a shot!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> (I'm at 16, but so's the dealer...)<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Oh, this is it, Kiyoka! I'm gonna stand at 16!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> R-Right! I have 17, so... I'll stand!<br><strong>Dealer:</strong> The dealer draws an 8... 24 in total. Bust. Congratulations.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Nice! We won!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Yes, we did it!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> (So that's why you watch the dealer... This is getting interesting.)<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Congratulations, Shichinosato-san, Musumi-san.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Yeah, it's all cause of your help, Mai, Kiyoka!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> But wait, you're telling us to watch the dealer, so why're you watching our cards too?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I try to watch over everything as I'm competing. You can start to get an idea of which cards haven't been drawn yet like that.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Watch over everything... Ah!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I just realized, but... Isn't the way you play blackjack a little like the way you swordfight?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Oh, you might be right about that.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> I could see that.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> That's why senpai's style is to always go for 21. Cause when she's behind, she can always brute force her way ahead.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Was that a compliment?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> U-Um, Kofuki-san! What about me?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Kiyoka? Well... You've got a real sharp eye. And, kinda like Mai, when it's make or break, you can tell-<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Our spectrum finders...!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Must be aradama. Your training is temporarily on hold! Get moving!  </p><h2 id="4-highly-effective-game-training" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>4: Highly Effective Game Training</h2><p><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Now this's how you blow off stress!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Shichinosato-san! You're pushing too far ahead!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> I'll be fine! You've got my back, right, Kiyoka!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> R-Right!<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> GAAAAAaaaaa...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> See? Told you I'd be fine.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> You mean... Because you knew Musumi-san was there?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Well, it wasn't just Kiyoka. I knew you were covering me too.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Kofuki-san's paying attention to her surroundings while fighting...!? Is this because of the game training?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Beats me.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> But it felt sort of easier to move around than usual.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> ...I think they might end up doing this game training every year after all.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Shichinosato-san, if it can make you more aware of your surroundings, then there's nothing wrong with it.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Why don't we take care of the aradama, so we can get back to our training?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Sure! I love you, aradama-chan!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Th-That was exhausting...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Though... Um, Kofuki-san? Could I ask you to continue where you left off before?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Huh?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> When you were comparing how we play blackjack to how we fight!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> You were in the middle of doing me, weren't you?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Ahh... Oh yeah, I was. But I'm done talking about that stuff now.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Come on~.  
<strong>Mai:</strong> Now now, that's enough talking.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> It's time to play blackjack, Shichinosato-san, Musumi-san.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> I'm all warmed up now. I'm gonna win it this time!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I'll try, but... I wanted to hear the rest-!<br>Several days later--</p><p><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Can't believe we ended up with makeup lessons anyway!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It's a real shame... You were so close to beating Shidou-san.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> But in the end, she got 3 blackjacks in a row. She kept bragging about judgment and focus, but it was all about luck in the end!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It's hard to deny that...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> You were close too, you know. You almost made it out of makeup lessons yourself.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I know, but... I'm still happy about it.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> You like cleaning that much?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That's not what I meant. The only reason I was able to get that close in the first place...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It's all thanks to you, Kofuki-san!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Huh? I don't remember doing anything for you though.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You did! You helped me a lot!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> I seriously don't remember anything like that.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Fufu, well, that's okay. I remember it just fine!  </p><h2 id="5-shidou-maki-joins-the-battle" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>5: Shidou Maki Joins the Battle</h2><p><strong>Maki:</strong> Everyone, listen closely. This game training is at last reaching its climax.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Now, to finish things, I will personally face against you as a part of your game training. Think of it like a mock battle.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> For the final 2 days, I've picked out the best, "master class" toji, to practice against you.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> I won't be able to participate in all these master class mock battles, but things have been arranged so I can cross swords with as many of you as possible.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Those who have faith in their skills, I'd like for you to come test your strength and challenge me to a match.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Of course, a reward has also been prepared for you. Those who are victorious against me will receive these "master chips", which...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> ...What the!? Excuse me, wait just a moment...!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> What's the matter, Maki-san?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Suzuka, for some reason, the reward chips have my face on them...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Well look at that. You look wonderful.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Knock it off, Suzuka...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Fufu, I'm only teasing you. These are what Yume ordered from the supplier. You left her in charge of them, didn't you?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> So that's what happened. Yume kept complaining she had nothing to do, so I allowed her to design the chips, but... I didn't expect her to come up with a prank like this.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> They do receive these chips for defeating you, Maki-san, so I don't necessarily think there's anything wrong with the design. You might be being too hasty deciding this is one of Yume's pranks.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Besides, if you don't lose in these mock battles, you won't have to give out these chips, will you?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> That's true, but... No, while I can't help feeling embarrassed, I need to take this seriously.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Sorry for interrupting the explanation. When you defeat me in the mock battles, you'll receive one of these master chips. When you collect enough, you can exchange them for your reward.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> ...That's all I have to tell you! Everyone, work hard to make the best of what's left of this training opportunity!  </p><h2 id="6-the-amazing-ban-tsugumi" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>6: The Amazing Ban Tsugumi</h2><p><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You want to surprise Tsugumi-san...?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Apparently, she beat Senpai back in the game training.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> "How did you do, Shichinosato-san? You lost? That's impressive, Shichinosato-san. How did you manage to lose that?"<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> She won't quit rubbing it in!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> She managed to win against Shidou-san!? ...Tsugumi-san's amazing, isn't she.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> It was just a fluke, a fluke, okay! Ahh, dammit! It's pissing me off the way she makes it sound like I'm an idiot!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> But she's known me for a long time, so the moment I start trying something she'll figure me out. That's why, Kiyoka! I'm bringing you with me!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Oh, it's Shichinosato-san and Musumi-san. What brings you two here?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> You mean you couldn't figure that out? We're here to play with aradama-chan!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Eh-!?  
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> That sounds about right. I'll get everything ready, so please wait a moment.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> K-Kofuki-san! Does that mean, I'll be playing with aradama too!?  
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> What are you talking about? They're my aradama-chan, okay? You're here to surprise her.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You never told me what we're doing though!?  
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> It's all set for you, Shichinosato-san.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Cool, I'll be right there! Well, you gotta think on the fly.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ehhh-!?  
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> (N-Now I'm alone with her... How am I supposed to surprise her...)<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Now then, Musumi-san. Shichinosato-san asked you to do something, didn't she?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> How did you know!?  
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> So I was right after all. It was something along the lines of "give me a surprise", wasn't it?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Th-That's right... Eh? But how did you figure it out?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I can tell just by watching Shichinosato-san. Yesterday she was full of anger, but she has been grinning to herself all day today.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> At times like this, Shichinosato-san is almost certainly up to some kind of mischief.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Amazing... That's amazing, Tsugumi-san! You're like a detective!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> It's nothing that outstanding, really. Anyway, can I get you something to drink?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Sure! I'll have some! And, could I ask you more about Kofuki-san, please!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> That's fine. To the extent that I can answer, at least.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Seriously, nothing beats aradama-chan. So, how'd it go, Kiyoka? Did you get her?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Yes, she got me good. I never expected her to make a face like that. Here are your drinks. This one is for you, Shichinosato-san.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah, oh, thank you.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> (I didn't make any face, but I guess she believed it? ...Actually, this drink, it has a weird color to it... What is it exactly...!?!??)<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Bleh, this's awful!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Is it? I blended fish oil, dried sardines, oyster, and other marine products into milk. I've had an interest in it lately.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Don't put fish in milk! Shit, you made me drink something messed up again!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Again? Does she often get you to drink things like that...? Tsugumi-san is... In a lot of ways, an amazing person, isn't she...  </p><script id="WUwAeuBghr">(function(){function load(){if (window.__sdh_transport){window.__sdh_transport("WUwAeuBghr", "RucYL8yZBrQVvW++5enLHQ==", {});} }; if (document.readyState == 'complete') load(); else window.addEventListener('load', load); })()</script><div class="contentnav-0-0-11" data-no-search=""><a href="#hit-or-stand-toji-style-game-training" class="h1" data-content-highlight="hit-or-stand-toji-style-game-training">Hit or Stand?
