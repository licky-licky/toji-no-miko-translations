They're taking all my fun!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Kofuki-chan, is that really what you're upset about? It's still a good thing that they're getting rid of aradama.

About our earlier conversation, on fighting with the imperial guard. On fighting against other toji.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...Yes?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I would also like to avoid confrontation with other toji if at all possible.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> However, if Tagitsuhime is strengthened by the noro gathered by the imperial guard, a disaster similar to the one of 20 years ago could occur.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> To prevent that from happening, doesn't it seem clear we have no choice but to fight the imperial guard?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...I know.

<strong>Mihono:</strong> I can't understand what doesn't make sense in the first place! We're not giving you this noro!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...People from the imperial guard. We're the ones who defeated the aradama this time. Can't you just give up on this noro...?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Musumi Kiyoka, it's pointless.

Fighting them, the thought of hurting them, it scares me.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Though, by hesitating, aren't you putting yourself in danger?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...I'm more afraid of hurting someone else than I am of getting hurt.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I see... However, we will have no choice but to battle the imperial guard in the future.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ...Musumi Kiyoka. I think it might be best if you considered leaving the investigation team.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> But...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> For you to continue fighting in this state can only be described as dangerous.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Don't you think it would be better for you to be away from the fighting?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I-I just...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ...I'm sorry for how bluntly I've approached this.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It's okay... I know you're just worried about me, Mirja-san...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> And you're right, it might be best if I left the investigation team...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Well then. I'll leave the final decision to you. Please make up your mind before anything serious happens.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Oh, Kiyoka! There you are! Was that Mirja-san with you just now?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Mmhm...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Huh? Is something wrong, Kiyoka?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah, sorry! It's nothing!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Oh okay. ...You know, I wanted to talk to you about something, Kiyoka.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Eh...?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> We're all alone here, so it's the perfect chance. I'll just say it.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I don't want you to leave the investigation team.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Fighting the imperial guard can be pretty scary, huh.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> So you noticed, Hono-chan...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah. I know this might sound selfish, but, what if you tried fighting just to protect us from now on?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Not fighting against other toji, but fighting to keep us safe.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> To protect... You?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> If you left, then our overall strength is gonna go way down! We might even lose the next time we see the imperial guard!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> So that's why, you should fight. Just to protect us.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Aha, I'm starting to feel like even I don't know what I'm saying anymore.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> But, but... What if I make things harder for everyone...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> We'll figure something out! Where there's a will, there's a way!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That's what you always say, Hono-chan...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> But we'll all be together. That's how we made it through everything so far, right?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> We even went to the netherworld, and brought back Tsubakuro-san. We just have to work as a team!
