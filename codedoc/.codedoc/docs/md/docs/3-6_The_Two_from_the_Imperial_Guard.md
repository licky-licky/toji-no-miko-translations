## 1: Kiyoka's Reluctance (1)
**Mihono:** It's still hard to wrap my head around Yui and Hana being our enemies...  
**Mihono:** On top of that, it looks like they really are getting noro from aradama for Tagitsuhime.  
**Kofuki:** It's one thing if they're fighting us, but I'm not letting them get away with stealing my aradama-chan\! They're taking all my fun\!  
**Chie:** Kofuki-chan, is that really what you're upset about? It's still a good thing that they're getting rid of aradama. It helps people.  
**Chie:** Of course, it doesn't help that Tagitsuhime is absorbing the noro though.  
**Mirja:** They said that, by taking in noro, Tagitsuhime is growing closer to a perfect form, didn't they.  
**Mirja:** I believe we should do everything possible to prevent Tagitsuhime from amassing any more power...  
**Kiyoka:** Even so, I don't like the idea of fighting other toji using the okatana we were given to stop aradama...  
**Chie:** .........  
**Mirja:** .........  
**Academy Intercom:** Aradama have been identified in the area of this academy. Toji, make preparations for emergency sortie. I repeat, aradama have been identified--  
**Mirja:** We've been called to arms. Everyone, let's go at once.  

## 2: Kiyoka's Reluctance (2)
**Kofuki:** Feels great getting to mess around with aradama-chan\! Good thing the imperial guard didn't crash the party this time\!  
**Chie:** Though the imperial guard must have noticed the aradama appearing here.  
**Chie:** It'd be best if we collect the noro and leave as quick as we can.  
**Mihono:** G-Good idea...  
**Mirja:** Musumi Kiyoka. About our earlier conversation, on fighting with the imperial guard. On fighting against other toji.  
**Kiyoka:** ...Yes?  
**Mirja:** I would also like to avoid confrontation with other toji if at all possible.  
**Mirja:** However, if Tagitsuhime is strengthened by the noro gathered by the imperial guard, a disaster similar to the one of 20 years ago could occur.  
**Mirja:** To prevent that from happening, doesn't it seem clear we have no choice but to fight the imperial guard?  
**Kiyoka:** ...I know. I know we have to, but--  
**Mihono:** \!? Guys, over there\! The imperial guard are here\!\!  
**Imperial Guard:** You all are the investigation team, aren't you? Give us that noro, without any resistance.  

## 3: Mirja's Concern (1)
**Chie:** The imperial guard again...\!  
**Imperial Guard A:** They've been talking about your investigation team. About how many times you've gotten in the way of our noro retreival.  
**Imperial Guard B:** How utterly foolish\! Why can't you just understand the wonder of Tagitsuhime-sama\!?  
**Mihono:** I can't understand what doesn't make sense in the first place\! We're not giving you this noro\!  
**Kiyoka:** ...People from the imperial guard. We're the ones who defeated the aradama this time. Can't you just give up on this noro...?  
**Mirja:** Musumi Kiyoka, it's pointless. These are not people you can reason with.  
**Imperial Guard A:** Fufufu, you seem to understand your position well.  
**Imperial Guard B:** Tagitsuhime-sama's orders will be carried out without fail. If you won't obey, then we will take it by force\!  
**Kofuki:** Dammit, are we really doing this again? I don't wanna fight anyone besides aradama-chan\!  

## 4: Mirja's Concern (2)
**Imperial Guard A:** Urgh...\! I guess you really are as strong as they say\!  
**Imperial Guard B:** Even so, we aren't leaving empty handed\!  
**Kofuki:** Oi, what do we do about them? Things'll get annoying if they attack us again, so why don't we tie 'em up and take them hostage?  
**Imperial Guard A:** ...If we were taken hostage, it would cause difficulties for Tagitsuhime-sama... We'll leave it at this for now.  
**Imperial Guard B:** Investigation team...\! Don't think I'll forget this...\!  
**Kofuki:** Tch. Who do they think they are?  
**Kofuki:** If they were taken hostage, Tagitsuhime wouldn't give a shit about them.  
**Chie:** That just goes to show how much faith they have in her. They fully believe, if they were taken captive, Tagitsuhime would come to save them...  
**Kiyoka:** And the imperial guard will just keep coming back for more noro, won't they... How long will this keep going...  
**Mihono:** You look pretty worn out, Kiyoka. Are you okay...?  
**Kiyoka:** I-I'm fine. I'm sorry I made you worry about me.  
**Mirja:** (...Musumi Kiyoka. Even during this battle with the imperial guard, your sword hesitated.)  
**Mirja:** (As I thought, she cannot bring herself to fight the imperial guard. This isn't something I can overlook...)  

## 5: To Keep Your Friends Safe
**Mirja:** Musumi Kiyoka. I'd like to speak with you for a moment, if you have the time.  
**Kiyoka:** --It's about how I hesitated while fighting the imperial guard, isn't it.  
**Mirja:** ...So you're aware of it yourself.  
**Kiyoka:** I am...  
**Kiyoka:** While working as a member of the investigation team, I've become much more comfortable with fighting aradama.  
**Kiyoka:** ...But, the imperial guard are toji just like us. Fighting them, the thought of hurting them, it scares me.  
**Mirja:** Though, by hesitating, aren't you putting yourself in danger?  
**Kiyoka:** ...I'm more afraid of hurting someone else than I am of getting hurt.  
**Mirja:** I see... However, we will have no choice but to battle the imperial guard in the future.  
**Mirja:** ...Musumi Kiyoka. I think it might be best if you considered leaving the investigation team.  
**Kiyoka:** But...  
**Mirja:** For you to continue fighting in this state can only be described as dangerous.  
**Mirja:** Don't you think it would be better for you to be away from the fighting?  
**Kiyoka:** I-I just...  
**Mirja:** ...I'm sorry for how bluntly I've approached this.  
**Kiyoka:** It's okay... I know you're just worried about me, Mirja-san...  
**Kiyoka:** And you're right, it might be best if I left the investigation team...  
**Mirja:** Well then. I'll leave the final decision to you. Please make up your mind before anything serious happens.  
**Mihono:** Oh, Kiyoka\! There you are\! Was that Mirja-san with you just now?  
**Kiyoka:** Mmhm...  
**Mihono:** Huh? Is something wrong, Kiyoka?  
**Kiyoka:** Ah, sorry\! It's nothing\!  
**Mihono:** Oh okay. ...You know, I wanted to talk to you about something, Kiyoka.  
**Kiyoka:** Eh...?  
**Mihono:** We're all alone here, so it's the perfect chance. I'll just say it.  
**Mihono:** I don't want you to leave the investigation team.  
**Mihono:** ...Fighting the imperial guard can be pretty scary, huh.  
**Kiyoka:** So you noticed, Hono-chan...  
**Mihono:** Yeah. I know this might sound selfish, but, what if you tried fighting just to protect us from now on?  
**Mihono:** Not fighting against other toji, but fighting to keep us safe.  
**Kiyoka:** To protect... You?  
**Mihono:** If you left, then our overall strength is gonna go way down\! We might even lose the next time we see the imperial guard\!  
**Mihono:** So that's why, you should fight. Just to protect us.  
**Mihono:** Aha, I'm starting to feel like even I don't know what I'm saying anymore.  
**Kiyoka:** But, but... What if I make things harder for everyone...  
**Mihono:** We'll figure something out\! Where there's a will, there's a way\!  
**Kiyoka:** That's what you always say, Hono-chan...  
**Mihono:** But we'll all be together. That's how we made it through everything so far, right?  
**Mihono:** We even went to the netherworld, and brought back Tsubakuro-san. We just have to work as a team\! If we work together, we'll find a way\!  
**Kiyoka:** ...Okay. Thank you, Hono-chan. I think I'll try a little harder.  

## 6: Whereabouts Located (1)
**Hana:** --President Takatsu. You called for us?  
**Yukina:** We've found where Ichikishimahime has been hiding. Summon the imperial guard.  
**Ayumu:** We did it\! Now's finally our chance...\!  
**Yui:** After she absorbs Ichikishimahime, Tagitsuhime-sama will be complete, won't she?  
**Yukina:** That's exactly right. We can accomplish what we've dreamed of. Tagitsuhime-sama will surely be pleased.  
**Yukina:** And for that reason, there will be no tolerance for failure here. Each of you should brace yourselves for the mission at hand.  
**Hana/Yui/Ayumu:** Yes ma'am\!  
**Kofuki:** Anybody else feel like there's less aradama-chan around here lately?  
**Chie:** Well, the imperial guard have been putting in a lot of effort to suppress aradama.  
**Kiyoka:** I'm glad they're getting rid of aradama, but with that noro going to Tagitsuhime, it's a sort of mixed blessing...  
**Kofuki:** Dumbass\! Those are MY aradama-chan they're taking away\! There's no good side to this\!  
**Kofuki:** Maybe I should just snap all their okatana to little pieces...\!  
**Mihono:** Earth to Fukki. Okatana don't break... Though, the tip of mine is broken.  
**Mirja:** --The aradama designated for suppression have been sighted\! Everyone, prepare for battle\!  
**Kofuki:** Hehehe, you don't like it either, do you, aradama-chan\! Well I'll treat you just right\!  

## 7: Whereabouts Located (2)
**Mihono:** Phew... It's been another rough day...  
**Kofuki:** I didn't get my fill yet though... I miss back when the leakage incident just happened and there were still aradama-chan everywhere...  
**Kiyoka:** Don't expect me to look back fondly on when things were at their worst...  
**Mihono:** Why don't we get something to eat before we wash off--  
**Chie:** Everyone\! This is big\!  
**Mirja:** Asakura Mihono, turn the television on right now\!  
**Mihono:** Wh-What\!? Is Tagitsuhime doing another interview\!?  
**Mirja:** Tagitsuhime hasn't appeared, but this is critical nonetheless\!  
**Other:** State of Emergency  
**Akane:** I heard what's going on\! Please let me know their status in full detail\!  
**Sana:** By some stroke of luck, they managed to make it out just in time.  
**Akane:** I-I see... Then, right now, where are they...?  
**Sana:** We haven't found that much out yet... We can't get in contact with them.  
**Sana:** But, if we make any big moves, it could provoke the imperial guard. It would be a good idea to send out a small rescue team picked from our best.  
**Akane:** I agree. I was thinking the same thing.  
**Sana:** I'll talk to Kanami and Maki.  
**Akane:** Then, I'll speak to the investigation team. ...We have to hurry\!  
**Sana:** Right\!
