Are we doing anything interesting this time? Hurry up and let me see, Maki onee-san!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Last month we had fairly packed schedules; it was hard enough to find half a day to rest. How does it look this time?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> It's another pretty busy month, but it's arranged so each of us gets full days off at least.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> I'll send you all the data so you can go over it yourselves.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Thank you.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> It's true, there's just enough gaps between missions for some time to ourselves.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> So I get this day off, and this one too~? Huh? Suzuka onee-san, don't we have the same day off?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Would you look at that; that's quite the coincidence.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Then, we should go play somewhere together!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I'd be glad to. It's rare for our time off to match up like this, so we should take advantage of the opportunity.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I can't wait~! Maki onee-san, and Yomi onee-san too, if you have the same day off you should come with us!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Well, there's no way our schedules would line up that conveniently...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> That's strange, I have the same day off...<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I do too...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Hooray~! Now we can all go out together! This is the best! This is the best!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> We never get the same day off like this, so what happened here...?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yukari-sama must be planning something.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Don't think so hard about it, onee-sans~! We all got the day off together, so we should just have fun with it.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> In any case, I'm going to confirm with Yukari-sama that this wasn't some mistake.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> All of you have the same day off?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Yes. Since we don't get much time off, I'd think all of us getting the same day would never happen.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I was wondering if you were planning something by this, Yukari-sama...<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> I don't recall making any specific order here. Isn't it just that all of you happened to be without missions that day?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> It's true that all of us should have our work done for the time being that day...<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Then that day is simply the most efficient time to give all of you a break.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> See, see~? I said you were overthinking it, didn't I?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Oh yeah! Can you take that day off too, Yukari-sama? Then we can all have fun together!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Unfortunately, I have a pile of duties steadily accumulating that need to be dealt with. You'll all have to enjoy yourselves without me.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Well that sucks~. But at least the four of us are together, right!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yes, I'm glad we could clear up that it wasn't all some big mistake at least. Though...<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Will it really be alright for all of us to be absent on the same day?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> We can have our time off whenever, so wouldn't it be best if we adjusted the schedule now?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh, but I thought we were all going to go hang out together...<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Wait, there's no need for you to change your schedule. If you go making adjustments without good reason, it would throw other people's plans into disarray.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Since you have no work to do, you should enjoy your time off. So long as you fulfill the obligations you're given, you have nothing to worry about.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Y... Yes ma'am.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> ...Yukari-sama might have said all that, but I'm still not sure about this.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Yaaay! Yukari-sama said it's okay, so we're all gonna go play together, right!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Well, we did get approval from Yukari-sama... And it would be nice for all the elite guard to spend time together.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> You're right, you never know if we'll see another chance like this.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Alright-! So let's think of where we're going!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ...  </p><h2 id="2-you-have-the-day-off" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>2: You Have the Day Off?</h2><p>On the day everyone had off--</p><p><strong>Yume:</strong> Maki onee-san, Suzuka onee-san! They're starting the line for the roller coaster! We should get up in front.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Don't run like that, Yume. It's dangerous.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I'll be fine-! Who do you think I am!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> There sure are a lot of people who came to the amusement park today, aren't there?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I know, it's already so crowded. If only Yomi had come along with us...<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ......<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Hm? Yomi, don't you have the day off?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Yukari-sama. Good work. Is something wrong?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> To begin with, Yomi, I'm talking about you. What are you doing here?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes, I was doing my usual duties, reviewing paperwork that needs to be settled...<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> I'd heard Maki and the others went to an amusement park. You didn't go with them?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> They did invite me, but I remembered I still had paperwork to take care of.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Approved, unapproved... Approved...<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> That paperwork, it's not something that needed doing right now, was it?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> No...<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Then, on your day off, when your comrades invited you out, why would you refuse them and force yourself back to work?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> That's because...<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Yukari-sama. I appreciate your consideration for allowing all of us to take the day off at once... However, I can't bring myself to leave the Origami household without any members of the elite guard.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Is that something you discussed with the others before deciding?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> No... They looked so happy planning where to go on their day off that I couldn't bring it up, so I told them I remembered I still had work left to do.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> I see. Yomi, your devotion to your duties is one of your admirable qualities, however...<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> How about this. I have an assignment for someone as dedicated as you that needs to be taken care of today.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Understood, I'll do whatever you ask of me.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> In that case, take the day off at once.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Eh...?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Making use of the breaks in your work to rest is an invaluable part of self-management. Your mission today is to enjoy your day off to the fullest.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> But, Yukari-sama...<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Put away those papers at once, and begin your mission. That's all I have to say.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Yukari-sama! ...She's gone.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Yukari-sama gave me this mission, so I have to carry it out, but how...?  </p><h2 id="3-yomis-day-off" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>3: Yomi's Day Off</h2><p><strong>Yomi:</strong> Enjoy my day off to the fullest... That's what Yukari-sama told me, but what does that mean, and where could I do it...?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ...<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Ah, that's right. If I join Shidou-san and the others, who should still be at the amusement park, Yukari-sama must be able to accept that.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> First, to see if joining them is still a possibility. I'll call Shidou-san.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> She won't pick up... In that case, someone else...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Hey heyyy~! Yomi onee-san? It's Yume!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Tsubakuro-san, I wanted to talk to Shidou-san...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Maki onee-san went to go buy some ice cream. Get this, I'm about to ride a roller coaster with Maki onee-san and Suzuka onee-san!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I'm glad you're having a good time. When Shidou-san gets back, could you please tell her to call...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ah, she's back! I'll put her on!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Hello, Yomi? Sorry I couldn't get back to you. This place has been packed all morning. I wish you could've been here with us.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Anyway, what's the matter? Did something come up with work?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> No, it's not like that...<br><strong>Public Announcement:</strong> Sorry to report... ber of visitors... restricting entry... der of the day...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Oh, huh...<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> What was that?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> It's nothing. I was just thinking it was so crowded today, when they announced they're restricting entry from now on.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> They're... Restricting entry?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Ah, I think Suzuka has something she wants to ask you. I'm putting her on.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Hello, it's me. Yomi, which do you prefer, chocolates or cookies?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I don't mind either of them...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> When you answer like that, it only makes this decision harder... The souvenir shop here has all sorts of delicious looking sweets.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> It's a shame you aren't with us, Yomi. We could have had fun picking them out together.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Oh, it's our turn to get on the ride, so I'll have to hang up now. We'll buy you souvenirs on our way back, so do your best at work, Yomi.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ......If they're restricting entry, I won't be able to join them at the amusement park, will I...<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> In that case, where could I go to enjoy my day off to the fullest...?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Now that I think about it, I was never taught how to spend free time... What do I do...<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> If I look into it at the library, I might be able to find a book that can help.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Ways to spend free time... Ways to spend free time...<br><strong>Passing Toji A:</strong> Hey, next time we get a day off, wanna stop by Harajuku?<br><strong>Passing Toji B:</strong> Sounds good. Harajuku it is~!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> (I see, Harajuku...? I remember other toji often talking about having fun during their time off there.)<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> (If I go to Harajuku, I might find a way to enjoy my day off to its fullest. I should go now, for the sake of my mission...)<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Sigh, I've finally arrived. This is my first time coming here outside of suppressing aradama. It's crowded during normal hours.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Now that I'm here to enjoy Harajuku on my day off... What exactly should I be doing...?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Heyy, good looking~! Is something bothering you? Why don't I show you a good time~!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> A good time? Are you talking to me?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Ah-! You're from the elite guard... Satsuki Yomi-san!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> My bad! You know me, as soon as I see some cute girl I can't help myself. I had no idea you were one of the elite guard...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> I'm really sorry about this! Anyway, I'll leave you alone now...<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Please wait. Weren't you going to show me a good time?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Eh?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> In that case, by all means, let me accompany you.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> EHHHH-------------!!!!!  </p><h2 id="4-yuis-day-off-lessons" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>4: Yui's Day Off Lessons</h2><p><strong>Yomi:</strong> That is, will you teach me the fundamentals of "a good time in Harajuku"?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> You should loosen up first, Satsuki-san!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I'm sorry. I don't have a good understanding of what it means to spend free time.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> If you don't mind, I want to join you on my day off and have you teach me how to enjoy Harajuku. Would that be acceptable?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Hnnng, I couldn't be happier, getting a request like that! Of course I'm okay with it! It's my lucky day, taking Satsuki-san on a date around Harajuku~!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> I'll give you the full tour, so you can see exactly how I get the most out of Harajuku~!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I'll be in your care. What should we be doing first...?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> When it comes to Harajuku, the thing that stands out most is crepes!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I've heard about those before...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> And observing cute girls eating them!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Observing...? Is that right...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Of course! We shouldn't waste any more time! Let's head to where they're selling some~!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Okay, now we'll begin our lookout in front of that crepe stand!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Understood. When it comes to observing girls eating crepes, what should I be looking for specifically...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Just trust in your instincts, and when you see a girl who grabs your attention, look verrry closely at her behavior and expressions!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> My instincts... I see.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Ah-, that one's so cute! No, wait! Her friend next to her's good looking too~. I don't believe it, are they twins~? That's adorable~!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Stare...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> So what do you think, Satsuki-san? Can't get enough of those glittering "Which crepe should I eat" eyes, can you~?  
<strong>Yui:</strong> Just seeing that is enough to keep me coming back to Harajuku!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I see, their eyes were glittering? Understood, I'll focus on that point from now on. Is there anywhere else I should pay attention to...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Let's see~, for example... Like if you see a cool looking girl suddenly start passionately explaining the appeal of chocolate mint, while she licks away at it!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Getting to see that kind of gap in attitude is the real thrill of coming to a crepe stand!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> The enjoyment of witnessing the moment schoolgirls categorize their tastes, contradicting your expectations... Am I understanding it?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Mmm~, you don't have to make it sound so complicated, or even really understand it. Just so long as it makes you feel good, it's all alright!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> To be honest, I can't seem to find the same excitement in this as you can, Yamashiro-san. But in order to make a meaningful report to Yukari-sama, I'll try my best.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Ahaha, you're so weird, Satsuki-san! I know! To celebrate us meeting up today, how about I buy you a crepe?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Sorry that took a minute. Here you go! I only have pocket change on me, so I had to buy the cheapest cream crepe though.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Thank you for your consideration.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Chew, chew... This is simple, but very delicious.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> That's great~. I feel like I'm dreaming, getting to see Satsuki-san eating up close like this! Ahhh~ I'm being healed~.  
<strong>Yui:</strong> This is what time off is all about! Thanks to you, I had the best vacation. Now I'm refreshed and ready to give my all starting tomorrow!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> (Yamashiro-san seems to have fully enjoyed her day off, but is this actually what Yukari-sama asked me to do...?)  </p><h2 id="5-help-arrives" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>5: Help Arrives!</h2><p><strong>Yui:</strong> Satsuki-san, it's time for the next attraction: observing the girls standing in line at the bubble tea stand! Let's go!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Understood.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> You know, with the streets this packed, there's cuties every where you turn. Fun huh~.  
<strong>Yomi:</strong> (I'm not sure if the way Yamashiro-san enjoys her day off will satisfy what Yukari-sama asked of me...)<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Wait-! Those two cute girls that were together just now...<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Ah, Yamashiro-san, please don't leave me behind.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Sayaka-chaaan! Mai-chaaaan!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Yui.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Fancy running into you here.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> I know, it's like I won the lottery today~! I'm about to start tearing up! So, so? What're you two doing in Harajuku?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Sayaka-chan and I had the day off, so we thought we'd go shopping here.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> We drank bubble tea too.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Nnn~ I can't get enough of it~ This "girls day out" feeling! I can't believe I also managed to run into you two today~.  
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Also...?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Good, I caught up with you. Yamashiro-san, why did you run away?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Satsuki Yomi...<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Yanase-san and Itomi-san.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> You two are an unusual pair. What were you up to?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Today, I was having Yamashiro-san teach me meaningful ways to spend my day off.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Teaching you how to spend your day off...?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Satsuki-san said she wanted to know how to have fun in her free time, so I'm coaching her in my way of enjoying Harajuku to the fullest~.  
<strong>Mai:</strong> Coaching? What did you teach her? I want to know too.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Stuff like sitting in front of a crepe stand and observing the cute girls going by!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Observing...?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I learned to watch a person's eyes as they make purchases. And that it's essential to measure the gap in deviation between a person's style and their tastes.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> There's no better way to spend your day off than joining a cute girl to watch cute girls, don't you think~?  
<strong>Mai:</strong> I-I guess that's one way to spend it...<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Satsuki Yomi, did you have fun doing that?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I'm diligently trying to. But I'm still unfamiliar with spending time off.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I don't think... That's how people normally spend their day off.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> That isn't normal?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Huhhhh? You're kidding? I do this stuff for fun practically every day though...<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> If what Yamashiro-san does in her free time isn't normal, then what does a normal day off consist of...?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Satsuki-san, I'm sorry! I was having the best time with you, but I think I might've not really been all that helpful?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Um, if you don't mind, why don't the four of us enjoy ourselves together?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Could I join you?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> If Mai says so, we'll do it.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Eh, no way-! Somebody pinch me! I'm surrounded by cute girls! Forget having a good day off, I must be dreaming!  </p><h2 id="6-another-helper" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>6: Another Helper</h2><p><strong>Yomi:</strong> Yanase-san, and Itomi-san too, I'll be counting on your guidance.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> To start with, why don't we wander about and look at the western clothes on sale?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> This dress is cute, isn't it?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> I know, right! I think it'd look good on Satsuki-san! Here, hold it up to yourself for a second!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ...<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Satsuki Yomi, do you not like it?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> The materials seem to lack durability, and the shape of the sleeves would get in the way of fighting.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Ah, y-you're right... I didn't think of it, from that perspective.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Th-Then why don't we look in that general store over there? They sell some cute and a little strange mascot accessories. It's a popular place.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Wow, look at this! This doll's so uglycute~! (dasakawa)<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Aradama!?  
<strong>Yui:</strong> N-No! That's not what I said-! Not aradama, da-sa-ka-wa!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Forgive me. To me, it sounded like you said something else.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I guess that's proof that your mind is always ready for action. That's the elite guard for you...<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> What's the matter, you're checking your phone. Is someone trying to get in touch with you?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> No, it's nothing important.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> In that case, let's go to the next store! Forget about your phone!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> You're right. Let's go.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ......<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Satsuki Yomi, you checked your phone again.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I feel like I might receive an urgent message...<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I'm sorry, it's my mission to enjoy my day off to its fullest, but aradama suppression is weighing on the back of my mind...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Maybe, because things are so busy here in the city, it's hard for you to feel at ease?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> What do you mean?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Everyone has different places they feel like they can relax in. In your case, Satsuki-san, if we move somewhere that's more rich with nature, you'll have a better day off, I think.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I see, a place with more nature? It's true that Harajuku is so crowded it's difficult for me to calm down. I agree that we should move somewhere quieter.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> In that case, where would be good~? When I think of cute girls in the great outdoors, it's gotta be the beach!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Yui, it's November...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Shoot. But I wanted to see all of you in swimsuits~.  
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Huh? What're you guys doing all hanging out here?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Whoa! Even Kofuki-san's here now! That's it! You should come mess around with us, Kofuki-san!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Mess around? I just got done doing that with some aradama-chan, so I'm headed back to Kamakura.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Ehhh, it's only noon. What's the harm in hanging out with us for a while~?  
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> The harm's that I hate how packed the stations get at night. And the leaves are in their fall colors, so Kamakura gets a ton of sightseers this time of season.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Fall colors! That could do the trick. Why don't we all visit Kamakura and go leaf viewing?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> That could be good... I agree with Mai.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Good looking girls under the red leaves! That's the kind of scenery you can't see any other time of year. I'm all for this plan~! What about you, Satsuki-san? What do you want to do?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> The Origami estate is in Kamakura, so I knew about the leaves in their fall colors. But the idea of visiting there with the intention of sightseeing is very interesting to me.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> If we leave now, the stations shouldn't be crowded. Shichinosato-san, if it's not too much of a bother, could you show us some of the best spots to see the leaves?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Huhh? Why do I have to...<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Kofuki. Please.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...Ughhhh... Fine, have it your way. I'll show you around.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> But let me say this, I'm not going anywhere near the usual tourist traps. I find some good places every now and then when I'm on missions, so that's all I'll show you.  </p><h2 id="7-first-fall-leaf-viewing" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>7: First Fall Leaf Viewing</h2><p><strong>Mai:</strong> Wow, it's beautiful!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Amazing... The trees are all red.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Ooh~, that's crazy! It's as pretty as a painting! You know your stuff, Kofuki-san!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Right? If I say it's good, it's good. What do you think, Yomi-senpai?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ..................<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> O-Oi, are you in there? Yomi-senpai?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Ah-, excuse me! I was overwhelmed by the sight of all the leaves.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> This must have always been here in Kamakura, but this is the first time I've felt aware of it...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Gahhh~, I missed it, Satsuki-san losing herself in the fall colors! I'll get my camera ready, so please do it again!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ...Even if you ask me to, it's difficult to repeat it now.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> In front of a backdrop of autumn leavings, the seductive look of a slightly lost Satsuki-san! This works too~! A rare shot that can only be found this time of year!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Okay, okay~, it's your turn now, Mai-chan, Sayaka-chan! Try gathering up the leaves on the ground, and then whooshing them all up in the air~!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Eh? Ummm~... Like, this?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> The leaves falling down... They're pretty.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> The ground and the air are filled with such pretty colors. It's beautiful.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Mmmm~, that's good, that's good~! Beautiful leaves and beautiful girls! Kofuki-san, you need to get in here too~!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> No thanks, I'm fine over here!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> But you know, if you guys are gonna be this happy about it, I guess it was worth getting dragged along.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Oh yeah, Yomi-senpai, you're from Renpu too, aren't you? Do you know any other good spots?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> That's right... There was a place I heard about during my time as a student. It should be around here.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Then, to thank us, you should take us there!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I don't think you should tell others to do things as thanks...<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Understood. I'll think back and try to lead you there.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> It should be this place.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Wow, it's beautiful here too.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Well what do you know, even Yomi-senpai has some good ideas!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I'm glad to hear everyone likes it.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Please excuse me...<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Satsuki Yomi's stomach growls too.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I'm sorry. Thinking back on it, the only thing I've eaten today was a crepe.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> If I'd known we could have had a picnic together, I would have made some boxed lunches.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> If I'd known this would happen, I would have packed rice balls...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Well I thought something like this might happen! So while we were passing the shops just now, I bought some tasty looking stuff!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Hey, nice thinking!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Croquettes, senbei, dango. They all look tasty... Satsuki Yomi, which one do you want?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> In that case, I'll take a croquette.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> I want a croquette too! The ones the shops sell here are nice and cold. You've got a good eye, Yui.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Yay~! I got complimented.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Chew, chew... This dango is tasty. Mai, let me try your croquette.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Here, you can have half. Can I try your dango too?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Ahh~, it's so good. Compared to eating crepes in Harajuku, this is wonderful in its own way.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes. Eating here, surrounded by beautiful scenery, adds a different flavor than normal.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I've visited this area many times while on missions, but now that I'm here on my day off, I'm finding things that make it feel like an entirely different place.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Satsuki Yomi, right now... You're enjoying your time off.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ...This is what it means to enjoy your time off... I see, I think I finally understand it.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Everyone, thank you for joining me today.  </p><h2 id="8-day-off-report" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>8: Day Off Report</h2><p>The day after their time off--</p><p><strong>Maki:</strong> Yukari-sama, thank you for giving us our day off yesterday.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Were all of you able to enjoy yourselves?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Yes. We met at 8:00 am outside the entrance to the Origami estate. Afterward, the three of us moved as a group to...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Maki-san, you aren't delivering an aradama suppression report. Why don't we hand them their souvenirs before we tell them about our trip?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> For Yukari-sama, we picked out chocolate in the shape of the amusement park mascot. And for Yomi, these cookies.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Thank you.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Yomi onee-san, let me have some of those later.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Didn't you buy cookies for yourself, Yume?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> They were too good, so I already ate them all! Anyway, let's talk about our trip~. What was your favorite part of the park?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> In my case, I won't forget the go kart competition we had.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Maki onee-san was stepping on the gas so hard it sounded like her kart was going to break.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Y-Yume! You didn't have to tell them that!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> It was like watching a little kid, the way you kept trying to go faster.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Not you too, Suzuka...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> But I still won in the end. Next time, I wanna race Yukari-sama and Yomi onee-san too!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Good, I'm glad to hear you enjoyed yourselves.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> How did you spend your time, Yomi? I heard you didn't go to the amusement park.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes. I completed my mission to enjoy my day off to the fullest without incident, and have returned to make my report.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> The details of my report are written in this document, which you can read through if you wish.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Mission?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Report...?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> ...I see. You recorded not just the beauty of the scenery, but the flavor of the dango. This is a fine report.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Does this satisfy your conditions for my assignment?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Yes. Admiring the changing of the seasons through observing the fall leaves, and sampling the regional delicacies. I believe you fully enjoyed your day off.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh, you went to see the fall leaves? What the heck, that's no fair that only Yomi onee-san got to go! You should've let me go with you~.  
<strong>Maki:</strong> Yomi, do you mind if we read through that report too?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> No, go ahead.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Hmm. So this is what you meant by your mission. It sounds like it was a lovely time, going leaf viewing.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Mmhm. Reading over this, it's making me wish we had gone to see it too.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> In that case, if we're lucky enough to get the same day off again, why don't we all go to see the fall colors?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> That sounds like a plan. Another coincidence like this could always come up, even it's unlikely.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> When that happens, Yomi onee-san, you have to show us all the prettiest places!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I will. We can all go together next time.  </p><script id="nSrbrtyhFQ">(function(){function load(){if (window.__sdh_transport){window.__sdh_transport("nSrbrtyhFQ", "RucYL8yZBrQVvW++5enLHQ==", {});} }; if (document.readyState == 'complete') load(); else window.addEventListener('load', load); })()</script><div class="contentnav-0-0-11" data-no-search=""><a href="#complete-your-day-off-mission" class="h1" data-content-highlight="complete-your-day-off-mission">Complete Your Day Off Mission!</a><a href="#1-the-elite-guards-time-off" class="h2" data-content-highlight="1-the-elite-guards-time-off">1: The Elite Guard's Time Off</a><a href="#2-you-have-the-day-off" class="h2" data-content-highlight="2-you-have-the-day-off">2: You Have the Day Off?</a><a href="#3-yomis-day-off" class="h2" data-content-highlight="3-yomis-day-off">3: Yomi's Day Off</a><a href="#4-yuis-day-off-lessons" class="h2" data-content-highlight="4-yuis-day-off-lessons">4: Yui's Day Off Lessons</a><a href="#5-help-arrives" class="h2" data-content-highlight="5-help-arrives">5: Help Arrives!</a><a href="#6-another-helper" class="h2" data-content-highlight="6-another-helper">6: Another Helper</a><a href="#7-first-fall-leaf-viewing" class="h2" data-content-highlight="7-first-fall-leaf-viewing">7: First Fall Leaf Viewing</a><a href="#8-day-off-report" class="h2" data-content-highlight="8-day-off-report">8: Day Off Report</a></div></div><div id="-codedoc-toc" class="toc-0-0-8"><script>
