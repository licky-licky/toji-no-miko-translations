Is that the end of them?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Seems like it. I expected this to be tougher, but I'm glad we eliminated them quickly.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> We should be able to make it back sooner than planned. Since we're so far out in the mountains, let me confirm our location on my phone.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Oh my! Maki-san, will you look at this map? On the way back to the Origami household is...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Did something happen?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yes, something big. An amusement park!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Amusement park? That's all...? Don't scare me like that.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Maki-san, this is a rare opportunity, so would you like to go visit it together?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Where's this coming from, Suzuka?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> We all need some relaxation every now and then.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Ha... That's the sort of thing Yume would say.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Though, we did finish our mission early, so it can't hurt. Let's go see what it's like.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Hang on, Suzuka. Shouldn't we take a little break?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Is that all it takes to tire out Shidou Maki, first seat of the elite guard?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> No, I still have plenty of stamina to go. But your clothes and hair are still wet from the water coaster, aren't they? Here, I'll use my handkerchief.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Oh, you're right about that.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Fufu, thank you very much. Your hair is wet too, Maki-san. Let me use my handkerchief.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Thanks. I didn't think there'd be that much water splashing down, but the intensity of it all was exciting.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> You don't mean you were scared, do you?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Of course not. I wouldn't be scared by something like that...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> You say that, Maki-san, but you were screaming so loud on the roller coaster, remember?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Haha, oh, that? That wasn't fear; just my kind of etiquette.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Isn't screaming on a thrill ride the highest form of respect to its creator? That's why, when I'm enjoying one, I let it all out and scream as much as I can.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Fufu, I don't think you need to be that conscientious... But, it's quite like you.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> You know, with the two of us having a good time like this, we must look like ordinary high school girls.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> You're right. It's been a long while since we had the time to purely play around like this. What should we ride next?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> That's true. Next, let's get on the merry go round.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> You have some unexpectedly girlish tastes, you know.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Horseriding has always been one of my specialities since I was young, so I'd like to take this chance to show my skills...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Well I'd love to see that. Let's go, come on.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Ah, you took, my hand...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> What's wrong, Suzuka? Your face is red. Are you feeling sick?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I-I feel just fine.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Good then.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Hm? My phone's ringing. Yes, this is Shidou Maki. More aradama? Understood, we'll be right there.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Suzuka, aradama have appeared in the area. We need to deal with them.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> What unromantic aradama, arriving at a time like this.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> If we defeat them and head right back, we should still have time to go on rides.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> That's right, let's get them taken care of!  </p><h2 id="2-how-toji-enjoy-an-amusement-park" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>2: How Toji Enjoy an Amusement Park</h2><p><strong>Kanami:</strong> Hiyori-chan, check it out! They have a roller coaster, and go karts, and even a water coaster!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Mai's parents are impressive, knowing the owners of such a large amusement park.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I wish Mai-chan and the rest could've come with us...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Mai said she had plans with her family, so there's nothing we can do about it. And Kaoru, Ellen, and Sayaka are all on missions.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> She already gave us the tickets, so we should enjoy this place to its fullest and have something good to tell Mai about later.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> That's a good point. We need to have enough fun for all of them!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Still, don't let your guard down, Kanami. We might be off duty, but if aradama appear, we should help deal with them right away.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah, of course!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Good. Then, what should we ride first?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ahaha, you're getting into it too, aren't you, Hiyori-chan?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> W-We came all this way to the amusement park, so of course we're going to ride something.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> You're right. So why don't we get on the roller coaster first?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Mm, that's not a bad idea.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Alright! Let's go.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Oi, wait, Kanami! You're leaving me behind.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> That was one intense roller coaster, especially when it went up high.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah. I was screaming so much my throat's sore. My eyes are all dried out too.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Nn? Your eyes are dry?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> While we were riding, I didn't want to blink, so I kept my eyes open the whole time.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...Why would you do that?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Roller coasters go so fast, so I figured, if I don't close my eyes, wouldn't I be able to train my dynamic vision?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> It'll turn into swordfighting experience, I'm sure of it! Roller coasters are so much fun!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Your idea of fun is definitely wrong...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Well whatever. What should we ride next?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Why don't we go in the haunted house? It's a different kind of thrill than a rollercoaster.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> A different thrill...? That sounds profound. Let's go in.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> It was all bark and no bite, that haunted house.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Hiyori-chaaaan~... A haunted house isn't the kind of attraction you go in to fight the ghosts!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> It's not?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> You're supposed to get scared when you see the ghosts, but you shouted "There you are, ghost!" and tried to beat them. You're the one who scared me.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> But, if they're going to threaten us, it's our right to fight back.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> You're the one who doesn't know how to have fun, Hiyori-chan...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah, phone call.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Yes, this is Etou Kanami. ...Okay, understood.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Hiyori-chan, there was an aradama outbreak near here!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> I see. That haunted house was a good warmup. Let's go!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Hm? Isn't that Kiyoka and Mirja over there?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Etou Kanami, Juujou Hiyori. Were you also on your way to defeat the aradama that appeared?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah, they just called me about it. We happened to be nearby, so we could come deal with it right away. Were you two also in the area?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> We came to look into the Akabane swords around here.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> It would be reassuring, having the two of you with us. Let's head toward the scene.  </p><h2 id="3-we-cant-be-seen" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>3: We Can't Be Seen?</h2><p><strong>Mirja:</strong> All clear, extermination complete.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Pant, pant... We managed to beat them...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I'm glad we ran into you, Musumi-san, Kitora-san. Hiyori-chan, it's not closing time yet, is it?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> It should still be open.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Open? What are you talking about?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> There's an amusement park near here that we were playing in.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> We have tickets that are valid for today only, but the others were all too busy to come.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That doesn't surprise me. An amusement park, huh... That sounds like fun...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> If you want, you and Kitora-san should come with us!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Can we?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> We have enough tickets for four people. And it'd make Mai happy to know they didn't go to waste.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Then I want to go!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Mirja-san, we took care of the aradama, so...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I see nothing wrong with it. Our mission is completed, and this is a good stopping point, so we may as well.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Yes!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> They're closing soon, so we should race back there!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Okay!<br>At that time, the two from the elite guard were--</p><p><strong>Suzuka:</strong> We made it back safely before the park closed.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> It's a good thing we dealt with them so quickly.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> You seemed stronger than usual today, Suzuka. Did you want to ride the merry go round that badly?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I always put all my efforts into suppressing aradama.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Right, that was rude of me. Anyway, we're back now, so let's pick up where we left off.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> And this is the place. Ready to show me those horseriding skills you're so proud of?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Of course; let's get on that white horse over there. Hah-!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Huh?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Over there, isn't that... Shidou-san and Konohana-san!?  
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Wha, am I hallucinating?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> The Shidou Maki and Konohana Suzuka are...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Laughing and riding the merry go round together...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah-, they're getting off. Hide!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> I went along with it and hid, but...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Why should we need to hide?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Sorry, I just felt like we saw something we weren't supposed to be seeing...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Well why don't we just watch them like this for a while?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I had a good time on the merry go round. On top of that, I now have this photo of Maki-san riding a white horse to make as my phone's background.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Wh-When did you take that picture!? If anybody else saw me like that...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> And with this, I have Maki-san's weakness in the palm of my hand.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> You wouldn't!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Ufufu, I'm only joking~.  
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> They're like completely different people from when they're fighting...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah, they look like they're having a good time. Why don't we try calling out to them and joining up?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Etou Kanami, that wouldn't be very tactful of you. The two of them must rarely get to spend time like this together, so we shouldn't disturb them.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Ahh, I agree... I have no idea how I'm supposed to react to them...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Mmmm, that's a good point. Then, why don't we go ride something else?  </p><h2 id="4-its-always-a-serious-competition" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>4: It's Always a Serious Competition</h2><p><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> So many attractions look like fun that I can't make up my mind. What can the four of us do together...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah! Let's race the go karts over there! It'd be cool to have a showdown with each other.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> A showdown? That could be good.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I agree, I'll join in.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> If everyone wants to do it... Me too.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Hmm... I thought it would be more intended for children, but that looks like a proper course.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> The kart's frames look to be the latest model. This should be a good environment for a conclusive showdown.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Are we going to be driving these...? I wonder how safe it is...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Musumi-san, you can drive as safely as you feel like.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> That's right, you shouldn't feel pressured to drive any faster than you're comfortable with. Just go at your own pace.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> However-- I'm going on an all out offensive. I'll start from the innermost track. Does anyone mind?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Eh? Does it matter where you start from? They all go the same way.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> That's naive, Kiyoka. Starting closer to the inside gives you a shorter route to the goal. You need to take the course considering the fundamentals of racing.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ooh, Hiyori-chan's eyes are lighting up like when she's going into battle...!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Wait, then I want to start from the inside too! I won't lose to Hiyori-chan!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> We should do a game of rock-paper-scissors to decide who starts there.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Hm... Fine then. Our showdown begins with rock-paper-scissors. There's no way I'm losing.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Me neither!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> (Wow... Those two, they're so serious about this...)<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Hm? By the way, what happened to Mirja? I haven't seen her since we got here...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Excuse me, I kept you waiting.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Where'd you go, Mirja-san?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> To the park office, so I could borrow some tools.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Tools? For what?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> For modifying the engine.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ehh!?  
<strong>Mirja:</strong> In the world of competition, it's only natural to take every available avenue towards seizing victory.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> I get it... Not just thinking of where you start, but the machine you start in. Not bad, Mirja.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Should you really be impressed by that!?  
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> This is looking like an even more dangerous competition than I thought...<br>At the same time, Maki and Suzuka were walking nearby--</p><p><strong>Suzuka:</strong> That's an incredible noise they're making.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> That must be the engines of the go karts over there.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Th-They're fast! I didn't think karts these days could reach those speeds.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> I want to try driving one, but the park's about to close.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> In that case, why not come back here again? We were on a mission today, so we're still in uniform, but we can dress up and come back next time we have a day off!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Ahh, I'd like that.  </p><h2 id="5-amusement-park-memories" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>5: Amusement Park Memories</h2><p><strong>Yui:</strong> Oh yeah, Kiyoka-chan, when the investigation team has time off, where do you go for fun?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Hmm... Everyone gets different days off, so it's hard getting us all together.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah, but not too long ago, I went with Mirja-san to an amusement park after a mission.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Mirja-san went to an amusement park!? I'd never have guessed you're into those!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I'm willing to go to amusement parks. And, at the time, Etou Kanami and Juujou Hiyori offered us tickets.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Oh, really? That sounds like a good time, everyone at the amusement park.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Yes! It was! You should come with us next time, Yui-chan!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Ah... Sorry! I'm super happy you invited me, but I won't go to amusement parks...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Eh? Why not?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Are you not good with the rides?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> It's not like that...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> To tell the truth, for years now, my little sister's been sick in the hospital.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> When she was first starting elementary school, we went to an amusement park together.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> But she was still really short at the time, so she couldn't ride the roller coaster.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> So on the way home, I promised her that, when she's tall enough to ride, we'd go together again.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> ...But my little sister isn't ready for that promise yet.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Even now, she still brings it up. When she's better, she wants to go with me.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> So I made up my mind too; that until she's feeling better I won't go to an amusement park with anyone.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Is that a form of offering?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Offering...? What do you mean?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> When making a prayer, you vow to give up something you enjoy. The idea is that through abstinence, your prayer becomes stronger.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> I see~! That's sort of like it! I must be feeling superstitious.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> ...Hey, cut it out, you two. You don't have to go feeling all sorry for my sake~.  
<strong>Yui:</strong> After all, there's not a doubt in my mind my sister's going to get better!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> So once she gets out of the hospital, let's all go to an amusement park together!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> --Sure!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Okay. I'll look forward to it.  </p><script id="lGqFmZKqiF">(function(){function load(){if (window.__sdh_transport){window.__sdh_transport("lGqFmZKqiF", "RucYL8yZBrQVvW++5enLHQ==", {});} }; if (document.readyState == 'complete') load(); else window.addEventListener('load', load); })()</script><div class="contentnav-0-0-11" data-no-search=""><a href="#spending-time-at-the-amusement-park-the-toji-way" class="h1" data-content-highlight="spending-time-at-the-amusement-park-the-toji-way">Spending Time at the Amusement Park, the Toji Way</a><a href="#1-maki-and-suzukas-unexpected-day-off" class="h2" data-content-highlight="1-maki-and-suzukas-unexpected-day-off">1: Maki and Suzuka's Unexpected Day Off</a><a href="#2-how-toji-enjoy-an-amusement-park" class="h2" data-content-highlight="2-how-toji-enjoy-an-amusement-park">2: How Toji Enjoy an Amusement Park</a><a href="#3-we-cant-be-seen" class="h2" data-content-highlight="3-we-cant-be-seen">3: We Can't Be Seen?</a><a href="#4-its-always-a-serious-competition" class="h2" data-content-highlight="4-its-always-a-serious-competition">4: It's Always a Serious Competition</a><a href="#5-amusement-park-memories" class="h2" data-content-highlight="5-amusement-park-memories">5: Amusement Park Memories</a></div></div><div id="-codedoc-toc" class="toc-0-0-8"><script>
