Since you're a substitute, they probably want you ready at any time.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Nah, I can stay with you. In the case that Kanami or Yanase-san can't compete, I can be waiting in the audience.<br><strong>Friend B:</strong> I see... Oh! I spotted girls from another school!

I think that's Taisha-ryu.)<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (Looking at her, you wouldn't think she's so light-footed. And yet, the impact of her hits... The way she fights is so brutal, yet beautiful... I've never seen an infighter like this!)  
<strong>Mihono:</strong> (And then... Mashiko Kaoru-san...)<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (She's so small that her okatana must be twice her height... And yet, she's slamming it around so easily...

You can feel it; this is a fight to decide the greatest toji!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> That's right... Every year, the Origami family, who are responsible for unifying and organizing the toji, host this tournament. Which means it's a true test of skill for all who hold an okatana.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Even these days, the name of the Origami family has carried a great deal of trustworthiness in their management of Okatana. The Origami are an old and influential family... (In Japanese history, official documents were sometimes folded with origami as proof of their authenticity. Mihono mentions the phrase for that as possibly originating from the Origami family name due to their history and honor.)<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Under the control and management of the Origami family, toji disciplines split into five training schools: The Five Traditions.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Kanagawa's Renpu Girls' School, Gifu's Minoseki Academy, Nara's Heijou Institute... And then Kyoto's Ayanokouji Martial Arts School, along with Okayama's Osafune Girls' Academy. At this tournament, representatives from these five schools enter a fierce competition together.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...To put it bluntly, I wanted to enter too-!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I mean, to be honest, my skills might be middle of the road, but... If the matches were on a short timer! Then I'd do better...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> In fact, if they were lightning rounds I feel like no one could beat me... If I could just focus a little longer, even Kanami would've... Even Kanami...... I oughta stop, yeah.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (Anyway, my seat is...)<br><strong>Friend B:</strong> MIHONO-! HERE, OVER HERE-!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah! I'm back, you two!<br><strong>Friend A:</strong> You idiots! Stop shouting! Mihono, they just finished saying the pledge and the first round is about to start! Look, it's Kanami versus Ayaonokouji's representative!<br><strong>Friend A:</strong> ...This is it, the final round. I wasn't sure if Kanami would make it this far...<br><strong>Friend B:</strong> Yeah, yeah! It's too bad about Mai, but her opponent was Kanami after all. If only they'd faced off in the finals instead of the semi-finals!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> It's a real shame~. But, you know...... Huh? In the stands over there... Is that? Chii-nee!? She said she was going back to Osafune yesterday...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (Ahh-! That's why she said we'd meet again soon-!)  
<strong>Chie:</strong> Fufu, I think Mihono-chan spotted me. I was hoping I could surprise her again afterwards, so that's too bad.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> (That girl in the finals... Etou Kanami-san... At a glance she just barely won every one of her matches, but if Mihono says she's strong then I can believe it...)<br><strong>Chie:</strong> (Her opponent in the finals is Heijou Institute's Juujou Hiyori-san... I don't think she can overwhelm her, but if she can adapt and outmaneuver her it should be her win.)<br><strong>Chie:</strong> (Though, that okatana... Huh, that looks like Kogarasumaru... It can't be the real one, can it...?)<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Hmph. Chii-nee, if you were coming here you should've said something...<br><strong>Friend A:</strong> What's wrong, Mihono?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah, it's nothing! More importantly! The match is about to begin!  </p><h2 id="10-as-the-curtain-rises-the-attack-begins" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>10: As the Curtain Rises, the Attack Begins</h2><p>The tournament stadium was enveloped in an odd stillness. The tension before the match played a part, but there was another reason...</p><p>Gazing out from the front of the arena was distinguished seating for noble guests. From behind this seat, a door opened and the bamboo blind was raised. Accompanied by a toji, a lone woman stepped into the sunlight.</p><p>--------Origami Yukari.</p><p>Twenty years ago, there was a great disaster. At the time, at the age of only 17, Origami Yukari suppressed it and became known as a hero. Rising to the head of the Origami family, she replaced a great number of influential people. Her beauty, unchanged in twenty years, was plainly visible as she walked forward.</p><p>For the head of the Origami family to show herself... It became a cause for commotion; an unforgettable event expressed in a collective sigh of admiration.</p><p>Though everyone was overwhelmed, the head of the family sat silent. It was as though, until the match was announced to begin, she would not move even an atom.</p><p><strong>Referee:</strong> We will now prepare for the match to begin... Bow!<br>At the referee's signal, the two turned and bowed to one another.</p><p>Kanami's gaze was firmly locked on Hiyori. There was a sharp glint in Hiyori's eyes, however... She wasn't looking at Kanami.</p><p>Under the eyes of all who had come to see, from toji to those who knew nothing of swords...</p><p>All spectators caught and held their breath for what was about to come.</p><p><strong>Referee:</strong> Both of you... Utsushi!<br><strong>The two's bodies became enveloped in a glow that would protect them from harm. This was the battle armor of a toji:</strong><br>utsushi. A power belonging only to those who hold an okatana. Their ordinarily frail body protected by the netherworld; a temporary body takes its place. It allows them to escape death once, though after that the body vanishes.</p><p>Utsushi prepared, the two stood ready to face one another.</p><p>Etou Kanami, adapting to the moment, raised herself into the Mugyou no Kurai stance. Juujou Hiyori, lowering her center of balance, adopted the Sha no Kamae stance. Both were old stances, both equally unexpected.</p><p>And, at that moment, the curtain was raised.</p><p><strong>Referee:</strong> Begin!<br>In an instant, the world was turned on its head-</p><p>Juujou Hiyori vanished from the arena. In a split second, before even a thought could pass, it became clear what she had done.</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> (She deflected it!?)<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Third stage jin'i without preparation. Is this your "single sword"?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Absurd...!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> (She was completely defenseless! And yet, where did Origami Yukari pull those two okatana from!?)<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Have you come to erase your mother's regrets? Fufu... But taking Origami Yukari's head won't be so easy.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Tch...!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> That's as far as you go, traitor! HAA!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> (No! ...She's got me!)  
<strong>Maki:</strong> Minoseki's... Etou Kanami! How dare you interfere!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> What, are!? No, why did you save me!?  
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Just come with me! Hurry!  </p><script id="TBvEKjtPnL">(function(){function load(){if (window.__sdh_transport){window.__sdh_transport("TBvEKjtPnL", "RucYL8yZBrQVvW++5enLHQ==", {});} }; if (document.readyState == 'complete') load(); else window.addEventListener('load', load); })()</script><div class="contentnav-0-0-11" data-no-search=""><a href="#1---on-the-other-side-of-the-tournament" class="h1" data-content-highlight="1---on-the-other-side-of-the-tournament">1 - On the Other Side of the Tournament</a><a href="#1-what-it-means-to-carry-an-okatana-1" class="h2" data-content-highlight="1-what-it-means-to-carry-an-okatana-1">1: What It Means to Carry an Okatana (1)</a><a href="#theres-aradama" class="h2" data-content-highlight="theres-aradama">[There's aradama!]</a><a href="#ill-call-the-police" class="h2" data-content-highlight="ill-call-the-police">[I'll call the police...]</a><a href="#get-out-of-here-first-you-idiot" class="h2" data-content-highlight="get-out-of-here-first-you-idiot">[Get out of here first, you idiot!]</a><a href="#2-what-it-means-to-carry-an-okatana-2" class="h2" data-content-highlight="2-what-it-means-to-carry-an-okatana-2">2: What It Means to Carry an Okatana (2)</a><a href="#3-the-gale-and-the-storm-1" class="h2" data-content-highlight="3-the-gale-and-the-storm-1">3: The Gale and the Storm (1)</a><a href="#4-the-gale-and-the-storm-2" class="h2" data-content-highlight="4-the-gale-and-the-storm-2">4: The Gale and the Storm (2)</a><a href="#5-a-tojis-duty-1" class="h2" data-content-highlight="5-a-tojis-duty-1">5: A Toji's Duty (1)</a><a href="#6-a-tojis-duty-2" class="h2" data-content-highlight="6-a-tojis-duty-2">6: A Toji's Duty (2)</a><a href="#7-dont-think-youre-getting-away-1" class="h2" data-content-highlight="7-dont-think-youre-getting-away-1">7: Don't Think You're Getting Away!
