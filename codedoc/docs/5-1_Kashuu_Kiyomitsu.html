After all, it's Tagitsuhime's true body, right! It sounds interesting! I'll do it!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> It feels like it's finally time for us to break out the secret weapon!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Whatever may happen, do not let your guard down. In both size and strength, Hirukomitama will be no ordinary foe.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> What's more, this operation comes with a time limit. If you are unable to defeat Hirukomitama before it makes landfall, all will be lost.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> And, after you have destroyed Hirukomitama, you are to return here at once. Do you understand?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> So, the important bits are, I just have to beat it real quick and come right back, right?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Yes. That's all I can ask for. You understand as well, don't you, Asakura?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Huh...? But, then, what about Tagitsuhime...<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> I'm telling you, there is no time. We have no choice but to trust Etou and Juujou with Tagitsuhime.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Etou and Juujou as they are now will surely destroy Tagitsuhime! You will fulfill your own role!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I just have to trust Kanami and Juujou-san then... I got it...!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Kashuu Kiyomitsu onee-san, don't slow me down out there, okay!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Don't worry about that... Right now, I'm pretty strong too!<br><strong>Inago Akira:</strong> ......<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Mihono, you seriously went up into the border between here and the netherworld... Just like Makocchan said you would.<br>May 2019.</p><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> M-Makeup lessons are over~... Good work today, Kanami~.  
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Also, thanks for helping us study, Mai.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> This is about all I can do, so don't think anything of it, Mihono-chan.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> We'll all go up a year together, for sure.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ha... Haha, hahahaha... There's still a whole year left too, and yet... That it'll be this bad, being at the level of not being able to move up a year...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I mean, it's not like I think I'm really smart or anything, but, if even Fukki can move up a year...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I think that might be a little rude to Shichinosato-san...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Don't worry, it's fine. You still have a year to go, so how about we work our way back up from here?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> That's not gonna be easy, Mai... For Kanami either... Just look at her.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> ......<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> She studied so hard she died on the inside.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Kanami-chan!?  
<strong>Kanami:</strong> ...I-I'm fine, Mai-chan... It's just, after nothing but makeup lessons every day, and covering so much subject material...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Kanami was totally absent for the third semester of her second year, after all.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah, if I didn't have Mai-chan, I wonder how things would turn out for me now...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Let's repeat our third year of middle school together, Kanami!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Let's do it, Mihono-chan!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Aren't we working so hard so you won't have to do that?<br><strong>Kanami/Mihono:</strong> Oh, right.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Okay, that's enough of the negative stuff! Let's go get some bubble tea, Kanami, Mai!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Mmm~! Bubble tea's so good!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> You're totally hooked on bubble tea, aren't you.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Of course I am, when something this yummy got popular out of nowhere!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Now that you mention it... In the time while you and Hiyori-chan were gone, a lot of things changed, didn't they.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah! I couldn't believe it when I heard Yukari-sama had retired and Akane-sama took over as the bureau director of the Sword Administration Bureau!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> And then, changes closer to us would be, the investigation team, wouldn't it?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> [slurrrp]... Eh? Ah, you mean, us getting attached to the Origami family?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I'm surprised you even got your own investigation room at Renpu Girls' School!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I was really happy about that. We never had anything like it before, so it's like, the investigation team's home base! It's exciting.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> And also, you've gotten a heck of a lot stronger, Mihono-chan.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Y-You think so~?  
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah! It's so much fun facing off against you! When we get back, wanna spar?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Sure thing! We've gotta exercise off the bubble tea and all!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Ah.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Is that a mission? Aradama are appearing as often as ever, aren't they.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Yeah.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Sorry, Kanami, Mai. I've gotta go.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Good luck out there, Mihono-chan.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Take care!  </p><h2 id="2-mihonos-dream" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>2: Mihono's Dream</h2><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> HAAAAAAAA!!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Phew.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> That aradama now appears to have been the last of them. You've done well, Asakura Mihono.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Seriously!? That was nowhere near enough-!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> And Mihocchi got practically all of them! Why can't you be more considerate to me, Mihocchi-!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Eh? Did I really beat that many?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> You did! Damnit, you took all my share.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Sorry, Fukki! I was feeling stressed out after my makeup lessons, so... I couldn't help it.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Like hell you couldn't! C'mon, c'mon! Be more sorry!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I said I was sorry~!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Your makeup lessons must be difficult, right?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah... But, if I don't do them, they say I can't move up a year...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Things are going so well on the investigation team side of things too, Mihono-chan. The heavens are too cruel to grant two blessings! You might be the ace of the investigation team, but your grades are in the red... Could this be gap moe!?  
<strong>Chie:</strong> I'm sorry, Mihono-chan. Under normal circumstances, I'd have liked to watch over and help you study, but...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> You don't have to treat it so seriously! So long as I do my makeup lessons right, I should be fine!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> And besides, you're busy with college, aren't you, Chii-nee?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Yes, it's a little busy right now... But, I should be able to get a bit more free time soon, so I'll help you with your studying then.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Okay!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah, oh yeah, Mirja-san. You and Kiyoka are looking into Kashuu Kiyomitsu for us, aren't you?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> How is that going, anyway?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> As of now, not well. It's enjoyable reading through the records, but we have nothing to show for it.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That's why, we were talking about not just looking up Kashuu Kiyomitsu, but researching into the Asakura family too.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> My family?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> We seem to be at our limit with this. So we've decided to try for a slightly different approach.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> However, we've only just begun down that line of research, so we have nothing noteworthy to report yet.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Oh, okay then.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> ...Mihono-chan? Is there something on your mind?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Eh!? Nothing really... Why're you asking all of a sudden, Chii-nee?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> I just had a feeling, like you're acting a little different than usual...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> No way; I'm the same as I always am!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (It's this same dream today...)<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (Of somebody heading into a sea of fire...)<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I had that dream again...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Something on my mind... I can't really tell Chii-nee, can I. That I'm just having this weird dream over and over.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> But, what's this dream about, anyway... Are you showing it to me, Kiyomitsu?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ......It's not like an okatana can answer me I guess.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yawn...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Not getting enough sleep?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah, kind of...<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Are things going alright, Asakura-san?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah, yeah! I'm just a little sleep deprived, so you don't have to worry about me!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> If you'd like, I could give you a drink that induces good sleep. I made it myself, and I'm fairly proud of how the calories and nutritional balance came out.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I-I don't think I'll be needing that...<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Is that so.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Then, I'll report to you the investigation team's next assignment. A new Akabane sword has been located, and the investigation team is to go recover it.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It's been a while since we did any investigating into the Akabane swords, hasn't it?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> That's for sure-. It's been nothing but suppressing aradama lately, so we haven't gotten anywhere with researching those.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> A new Akabane sword... We should leave at once.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Hold up, can I say something?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> What is it?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Do you need me for this?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Cause, if you don't, I'd rather go with the Special Raid Unit, y'know? I'd get to play with aradama-chan over with them.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I see, then, please go join them, Shichinosato-san.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> For real!? Never hurts to ask, huh!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> The report stated that large numbers of aradama had appeared in the area of the Akabane sword... But, I'm sure the other members will be able to deal with it.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Say that first!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Oi, what're you guys waiting for! Let's go already!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I see you're still as skilled at handling her.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Fufu, that's for sure.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Anyway... Investigation team, set out to recover the Akabane sword!  </p><h2 id="3-special-defense-team-all-present" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>3: Special Defense Team, All Present</h2><p><strong>Yukari:</strong> Enter.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Please excuse me.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> You're late, Yomi-onee-san! I was getting tired of waiting.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> It's been quite some time, Yomi-san.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ......<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Welcome back, Yomi. Yukari-sama, the Special Defense Team is all present.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> I'm glad you're here.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Ordinarily, Akane would be the one to deliver orders to the Special Defense Team. However...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> We understand.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Acting as both the bureau director and head of the Origami family, Akane-sama's burden grows by the day.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> To the point where, even making time to hand down our orders would require adjusting her schedule.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> I need you to be Akane's strength.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> We will.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ......<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Yukari-sama, what kinda mission do you have for us this time? If it's suppressing aradama, I want to do it!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Unfortunately, this is unrelated to aradama. Your assignment now is the investigation, as well as observation, of an extremist faction within Mokusa.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> An extremist faction in Mokusa?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> In addition to the main faction of Mokusa, with Akane acting at the top, there are many smaller sub-factions.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Among them, there is a faction advocating particularly radical ideals.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> That means there's a bunch of dangerous people there, right? So, all we've gotta do is beat them.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> This won't be solved so simply.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Even if they may be extremists, it doesn't make them a criminal group. They're no more than just another group within Mokusa.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> So we can't do anything to them until they do something dangerous first... That sounds kind of annoying.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...Well, it certainly isn't an assignment suited for you, Yume.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Everybody has things they're suited for and things they're not. I know you just joined us, but I want you to work on this, Yomi.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ...Will this really be alright?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Will what?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> With me being here, the Special Defense Team is now composed of all the former members of the elite guard.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> There will be people who won't approve of this.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> If you continue with only the three of you, there won't much protesting, will there?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Whether there's three of us or four of us, people won't be happy either way. You don't have to worry about our reputation.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> We cannot change the things we've done in the past... All we can do is strive to make up for it with our actions now.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ...But, I don't believe that I am wrong.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Yet, still...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> None of that really matters, Yomi-onee-san. What's important is that we're all back together.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Tsubakuro-san...<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> I called upon you because you are needed. Will you do it?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Yukari-sama...<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I understand. I will accept this assignment. Which faction is it I should be monitoring?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> We haven't gathered enough information to pin down a name at this point. But, several factions are showing suspicious behavior, such as in their movements of funds.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> I'll deliver the documentation to you afterward.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes ma'am.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> You three as well, I'm depending on you.<br><strong>All the Special Defense Team:</strong> Yes ma'am!  </p><h2 id="4-mihono-changing-1" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>4: Mihono Changing (1)</h2><p><strong>Mirja:</strong> The Akabane sword appears to have been discovered around here.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> There's not a single aradama-chan in this place!!

I even checked it for myself, and it's true that there were reports of large numbers of aradama appearing here.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I can confirm those reports as well. It seems it would be best to proceed with caution now.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Why even bother.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> If there's gonna be some aradama-chan, then that's great, but if there's not, then let's just hurry it up and go back.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> C'mon, let's get that Akabane sword already.

Mirja-saaan! I got the Akabane sword-!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I'll make the report to Ban Tsugumi that we have collected the Akabane sword.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> In response, she sent a photo of the Akabane sword... Setouchi Chie, will you please confirm this with me?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> ...Mm, this seems to be the one.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I'm glad we could finish this easily... This means our mission is over, doesn't it.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> We came all the way out here on a trip, so let's at least go pay a visit to some hot springs!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> There goes Yui trying to get us in the hot springs again-.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> That's just who I am! So, what do you think? Hot springs aren't so bad every now and then, right?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Thinking about it... It might be nice. I haven't been sleeping well lately...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> For that, I reccomend hot springs! Once you get in the water, it'll improve your circulation, and you'll have no problem sleeping like a baby!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ugh, that sounds really nice right about now...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...That reminds me, Hono-chan. You were looking sleepy in the investigation room too, weren't you?<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> ......<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> -! Kiyoka, behind you!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Eh?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> She's in trouble!!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Th-Thank you, Hono-chan.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> But...<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> ......<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> There's so many... Are we surrounded?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I've never seen such organized behavior before. I would think there is some kind of leader behind this group...<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> What an awful sound...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> There's the king of the hill, or, king of the aradama... I guess?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> More intelligent, and more capable... This will be trouble.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah. That aradama... It's strong.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Like it matters!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> I finally get to see me some aradama-chan! Let's get right to the fun!  </p><h2 id="5-mihono-changing-2" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>5: Mihono Changing (2)</h2><p><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> KYAA!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Are you okay, Kiyoka-chan!?

Stay behind me, Kiyoka.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> O-Okay.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...Thanks a lot, Kofuki-san.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> It's nothing.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> ...What do you think we should do, Mirja?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> We should wait for reinforcements.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I finished reporting to Ban Tsugumi that we engaged aradama. When no follow-up report arrives, she should assume our circumstances here.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> ...I suppose that's our best option.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Wait.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Mihono-chan?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> An aradama like that, me and Kiyomitsu... We can beat it.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Now isn't the time to say things like that! Mirja is considering the whole team here...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> It'll be fine, Chii-nee.

See, I told you it'd be fine, Chii-nee!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Mihono-chan...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> If you find it too hard to say, then I'll be the one to say it. Asakura Mihono, your behavior just now was hardly commendable.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Huh?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> You may not have intended it, but that was a clear disregard for orders.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...But, I just thought, instead of waiting for backup, it'd be faster if I beat them...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Is this really something worth nagging her over? I do that kind of thing all the time.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Y-Yeah, she's right! More importantly, everyone's tired, aren't they? Let's go see those hot springs, remember!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ...Let me just say this.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Asakura Mihono, you should be using your strength to protect your allies before you defeat your enemies.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Fukki was protecting Kiyoka, wasn't she? So, I didn't have to...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> And what if Shichinosato Kofuki was attacked by more aradama than she could hold off alone?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> That was a possibility as well.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Then...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Let's leave it at that, Mirja.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> But...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Mirja, could you please get in touch with Tsugumi-chan?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ...Understood.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> ...You all did great. We had a rough time today, so how about we wash away our tiredness in a hot spring!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Um... Thank you for before, Kofuki-san.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> It's not really something you've gotta thank me for. I just did what was natural.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Of course!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> What're you two talking about, Kiyoka-?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Nothing at all, Hono-chan! Anyway, aren't you looking forward to the hot springs!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah! Hot springs~, hot springs~.  
<strong>Mirja:</strong> ......<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Was this for the best, Setouchi Chie? Asakura Mihono is...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> After suddenly getting a lot stronger, she can't get her mental balance right, can she.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ...So you do understand. Then, why did you stop me?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Well... I don't think you were wrong, Mirja.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> But... With how Mihono-chan is now, I don't think she would understand.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> You think she needs to suffer the consequences before she can realize it for herself? ...That's unusually harsh for you, Setouchi Chie.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Of course, I don't plan on neglecting her until she suffers for it.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> If we're all careful so that she doesn't get herself hurt... I'm sure Mihono-chan will come to understand it herself.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I take back what I just said. You really are too sweet on Asakura Mihono after all.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> I am her onee-san, aren't I?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yawn...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah, you yawned again.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Mihono-chan looks just as cute when she's yawning.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Quit making passes at her. Anyway, what're you doing that's keeping you up at night?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Nngh, I'm not really doing anything.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You say that, but I bet you're training, aren't you?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I'm not, I'm not.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Are you chatting online?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I'm not. It's just... I've sort of been having bad dreams lately.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Hmm? What kind of dreams?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Uhh... I can't really remember much about it.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Well, dreams are like that. You'll stop having them sooner or later.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Yeah, you're right.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (You'll stop having them sooner or later... Yeah, that's all there is to dreams!)

I'm no good like this, am I. Losing my focus in the middle of a fight; it's like I've gone back to how I used to be.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> It's dangerous spacing out in the middle of battle, but I still love you when you're like that, Mihono-chan!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Mihono-chan.

On top of which, Kashuu Kiyomitsu's power unintentionally manifested... Then, is your power running rampant?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Rampant...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> ...And, since when has this been happening?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> The nightmares... I don't really know. I can't remember anymore.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I think, after I started being able to use Kiyomitsu's power, that's when I first noticed it.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> And, when it went rampant... It was after we searched for that Akabane sword the other day.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> So that's why you haven't been getting sleep this whole time...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Seeing the same dream over and over... That's kind of scary, isn't it. And, when it went rampant... It would be dangerous if you used hachimanriki or something by accident...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I keep thinking, if I sleep, it might happen again, so I haven't been sleeping much...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> That dream and your power going rampant, maybe it has something to do with the Akabane sword you found on that mission?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I wouldn't know...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> No, I received a report on that Akabane sword, and there was nothing that seemed related to this in it.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> That's right. I used kantougan to examine it as well, and it didn't have any such ability.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> (That reminds me, when I visited Asakura Mihono's grandfather, Mr. Yoshizumi, he seemed to believe that the tip of Kashuu Kiyomitsu was embedded in Asakura Mihono's body...)<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> (If that wasn't a supposition, but the truth... Asakura Mihono would be someone joined with an okatana. Which would mean she is constantly at the risk of her power running rampant.)<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> (Even so, at the very least, she must have been controlling it up until now. What would have caused that to change...?)<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Mirja?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ...Asakura Mihono. You are forbidden from fighting with your full strength.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> At least, until our research on Kashuu Kiyomitsu makes progress, please refrain from using Kashuu Kiyomitsu's power.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I-I can handle it! I've been fighting all this time together with Kiyomitsu! And, I only lost control that one time!!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Mihono-chan. I think you should do what Mirja says.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> These nightmares, and Kashuu Kiyomitsu's power running rampant. We can't be sure if these two things are linked, but... It's true that they're having a negative effect on you right now.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Chii-nee...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Linked? You mean, her okatana's showing her that nightmare? I've never heard of anything like that before.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Have any of you here seen nightmares like that?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I haven't... I don't think.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> I really only remember having good dreams.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I've never heard of it myself either, but we should proceed with the idea that there is a causal relationship in mind.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Considering Asakura Mihono, I don't think it's possible for us to be too cautious with her.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (Chii-nee and Mirja-san, they're both worried about me...)<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (But... Kashuu Kiyomitsu, it's the okatana my mother left me. I've been fighting with it all this time...)<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (There's no way my partner could be something bad!)  
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...I got it.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> But, I can't just wait for the investigation to find something. I want to do something about it too!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> You want to do something...? I see. In that case, why not train to control Kashuu Kiyomitsu's power?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Regardless of the nightmares, it should be something beneficial to you in the future.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Alright!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Hono-chan! I'll look through a lot of records for you, okay!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Thanks, Kiyoka! I'll do all I can with training too!  </p><h2 id="10-reunion-on-the-raid-unit" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>10: Reunion on the Raid Unit</h2><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> Heeeey!

Mihono is here.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Oh-, showed up right on time, huh.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Sorry to make you help out with us on the raid unit, Mihono. You're busy with the investigation team too, right?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> No, I was feeling like I wanted to go out on a lot of missions, so this works out great!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Wait, were you always this serious about work?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> It's not really me being serious about work, but Mirja-san told me I need to be able to control Kiyomitsu's power.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Control it? Does that mean you messed up?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Err, well... A little.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...Alright. Well, do what you can. Knowing you, you'll figure something out.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Right, I'll give it my best shot!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Kaoru. We should leave soon.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> That's right, how about we get going.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Huh? Is it just us three on this mission?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> No. We'll meet with two toji at the site.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah, okay then. What kind of toji are they, Kaoru-san?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> What kind...? A habitually late delinquent, I guess.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> A habitually late delinquent?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Yep. She's serious deep down, but she always manages to show up late-.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> If she's a delinquent, is she just skipping?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Nah, she's an honest kind of person, so even if she's late, she still makes sure to show up. It's just, somehow, she always gets caught up in trouble.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (She's a delinquent, but she's honest, but she shows up late a lot... Why does that sound familiar...?)<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Though, it'd be pretty sad if we ended up late ourselves cause we were talking about her, so let's get out there.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah, right!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> HA-!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Looks like that's finally a quarter of them down. There's a lot more than I was thinking.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm. This seems like it could take more time than I thought. But, the three of us should be fine.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> That's for sure! ...YAAA!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Ohh, you're doing great, Mihono. How's things with your okatana?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Uhh... Yeah, it seems okay.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (Like Kaoru-san said, I might be doing great! Kashuu Kiyomitsu isn't showing any signs of going rampant, so I'll try holding onto this feeling!)  
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Is that sound a motorcycle...?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Huh, she got here faster than I expected.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> A Minoseki... and Ayanokouji toji?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> That bike, is that... Akira-san?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> What, you knew her? Well, she is a Minoseki toji and all, that yankee.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Yan... kee?<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Oi oi, no need to start praising me up already, Kaoru.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> I wasn't praising you.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Akira-san, it's been a while!<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Yeah, long time no see, Mihono. Haven't you been working hard?<br><strong>Akira:</strong> I've been hearin' a lot, about all your heroics. You're a total celebrity now.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Thank you very much!<br><strong>???:</strong> Akira-nee-sama, is this person Asakura Mihono-san?<br><strong>Akira:</strong> That's the one. This's Mihono.<br><strong>Toribane Yuuki:</strong> Pleased to meet you, Asakura-san. My name is Toribane Yuuki.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> You can just call me Mihono, Toribane-san.

You're Itomi Sayaka-san, aren't you.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> You can call me Sayaka.<br><strong>Yuuki:</strong> Pleased to meet you, Sayaka-san.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> The delinquent and the lady here always make a weird combo.<br><strong>Yuuki:</strong> Should you really be saying that, when you make an odd combo with Ellen-san?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Kaoru, are you close to them?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...Eh, it should be fine to let you know. These two are toji from Mokusa.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Akira-san, you're from Mokusa!?  
<strong>Akira:</strong> Yep. I get told a lot I don't seem like it, but I've been with Mokusa for a real long time.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I had no idea... Why did you and Yuuki join Mokusa, Akira-san?<br><strong>Akira:</strong> A childhood friend of mine invited us.

If you're wanting to control your strength, that's all the more reason you should practice using it.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Just leave it at that, Yuuki. Mihono's got her own circumstances she's dealing with. Don't push her too much.<br><strong>Yuuki:</strong> ...I'm very sorry. I only wanted to see Mihono-san's strength, after Akira-nee-sama gave so much approval of her... I shouldn't have bothered her.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> ...Sounds like you've got something going on, Mihono.

We'll bring Mihono back to normal!  </p><h2 id="13-strip-my-flesh-to-break-your-bones" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>13: Strip My Flesh to Break Your Bones</h2><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> ......!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Shit, Mihono's way too damn strong...!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> She's fast, but also hits hard... What do we do, Kaoru?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Good question... This would go easier if someone could tough her out...<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Want some help?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Don't need it!!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Kaoru, it's getting desperate.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Just a little! Akira!<br><strong>Akira:</strong> What?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> I don't want your help, but you can give me some advice! What should we be doing!?  
<strong>Akira:</strong> Get rid of her utsushi! After that, she'll be back to normal!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> I'm trusting you on this! If you're lying... You're gonna pay!<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Trust me, it'll work. I wouldn't lie when my cute kouhai there's in a pinch.<br><strong>Yuuki:</strong> Akira-nee-sama, are we really not going to lend them assistance?<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Kaoru's a girl of her word. And anyway, if you went out there, Mihono'd just chop you up.<br><strong>Yuuki:</strong> ...If she cut me, I would cut her back.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> If she cuts you, cut her back... Really don't want to do this, but let's go with that!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Sayaka! I'll get her attention! You use that to break her utsushi!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Understood.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Alright... Let's make this work!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> This way, Mihono!! Don't go looking anywhere else!!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ......<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Yeah, just like that...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ......!!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Gagh...!<br><strong>Yuuki:</strong> Akira-nee-sama! She got Kaoru-san!<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Ahaha! Strip my flesh to break your bones, huh! Now that's fighting dirty; I like it!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Quit laughing!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Shit, this hurts...! But, I've finally got you trapped!!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Sayaka!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ......<br><strong>Yuuki:</strong> Nee-sama, she defended against it!? Even though they managed to create an opening...!<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Nah, that was just another feint. She's really after...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Your back's wide open, Mihono!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> UAAGH!!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> We got her utsushi off! She'll go back to normal now, right!?  
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ......<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Hey, the hell!? It didn't take!? Sayaka, cut her again!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...Mihono. She's not using utsushi.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...Huh?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> U-Ugh...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Huh? What was I...<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mihono, are you back to normal?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Itomi-san? ...Wait, Itomi-san, why's your okatana up like you're about to swing!?  
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> I was just... about to slash you.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> You can put it down now-. ...Sigh, that's finally over I guess.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Uhh...? Did I do something?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> You went on a full on rampage. Kashuu Kiyomitsu's power overwhelmed you and you passed out.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I passed out...?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mihono, you were strong. If Kaoru hadn't sacrificed herself, we wouldn't have won.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Kaoru-san sacrificed herself!?  
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Don't turn me into a sacrifice. You just cut through me once.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Then, I hurt Kaoru-san...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I'm so sorry, Kaoru-san... Because of me...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> I'm sorry for not being able to stop you properly either. Don't sweat it.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Okay.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> That's right, this is my fault. I went and said some things I shouldn't have. Sorry about that, Mihono.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...<br><strong>Akira:</strong> But, it's all cleared up now. Everything's like Makocchan predicted.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...What do you mean by that?<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Mihono.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Y-Yes?<br><strong>Akira:</strong> We know about this thing that's happening to you. You'd better prepare yourself, before it's too late.<br><strong>Other:</strong> The Time Left<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Akira.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> ......Is this about Mihono?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> What the hell else!? What was all that!? I haven't heard anything about this!!<br><strong>Akira:</strong> ...Can't tell you.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Are you shitting me!? Mihono's a close friend of ours!!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> And to you especially... What happened to her being your kouhai!?  
<strong>Akira:</strong> ...Even so, I can't tell you. I've got a reason I can't say anything.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> But...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> What.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> You don't have to do what I tell you, but, be sure you look after Mihono.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> She hasn't got a lot of time.  </p><script id="hQh_hfwzhr">(function(){function load(){if (window.__sdh_transport){window.__sdh_transport("hQh_hfwzhr", "RucYL8yZBrQVvW++5enLHQ==", {});} }; if (document.readyState == 'complete') load(); else window.addEventListener('load', load); })()</script><div class="contentnav-0-0-11" data-no-search=""><a href="#5-1-kashuu-kiyomitsu" class="h1" data-content-highlight="5-1-kashuu-kiyomitsu">5-1 Kashuu Kiyomitsu</a><a href="#1-we-wont-go-up-a-year" class="h2" data-content-highlight="1-we-wont-go-up-a-year">1: We Won't Go Up a Year!?</a><a href="#2-mihonos-dream" class="h2" data-content-highlight="2-mihonos-dream">2: Mihono's Dream</a><a href="#3-special-defense-team-all-present" class="h2" data-content-highlight="3-special-defense-team-all-present">3: Special Defense Team, All Present</a><a href="#4-mihono-changing-1" class="h2" data-content-highlight="4-mihono-changing-1">4: Mihono Changing (1)</a><a href="#5-mihono-changing-2" class="h2" data-content-highlight="5-mihono-changing-2">5: Mihono Changing (2)</a><a href="#6-disregarding-orders" class="h2" data-content-highlight="6-disregarding-orders">6: Disregarding Orders</a><a href="#7-cracking-glass" class="h2" data-content-highlight="7-cracking-glass">7: Cracking Glass</a><a href="#8-the-reason-i-cant-sleep-1" class="h2" data-content-highlight="8-the-reason-i-cant-sleep-1">8: The Reason I Can't Sleep (1)</a><a href="#9-the-reason-i-cant-sleep-2" class="h2" data-content-highlight="9-the-reason-i-cant-sleep-2">9: The Reason I Can't Sleep (2)</a><a href="#10-reunion-on-the-raid-unit" class="h2" data-content-highlight="10-reunion-on-the-raid-unit">10: Reunion on the Raid Unit</a><a href="#11-a-widening-crack-1" class="h2" data-content-highlight="11-a-widening-crack-1">11: A Widening Crack (1)</a><a href="#12-a-widening-crack-2" class="h2" data-content-highlight="12-a-widening-crack-2">12: A Widening Crack (2)</a><a href="#13-strip-my-flesh-to-break-your-bones" class="h2" data-content-highlight="13-strip-my-flesh-to-break-your-bones">13: Strip My Flesh to Break Your Bones</a></div></div><div id="-codedoc-toc" class="toc-0-0-8"><script>
