If I pass this up, I'll never get another chance like it.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Honestly, ever since we came here and I saw them fighting aradama, I've wanted to spar with them-.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> You said the same thing back when you first saw Hiyori-chan at the tournament, didn't you, Kanami-chan.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ehehe.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> You did? Though it sounds just like something you'd do.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah, Hiyori-chan. What's up?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> What do you mean, "What's up?" You're the one who said to meet here so we could spar now.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Oh yeah! Then, let's get right to it! I'll catch up with you later, Mai-chan~.  
<strong>Mai:</strong> Okay. Be sure not to get hurt, you two.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> ......<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> Mai-chan?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Tsuyuzaki-san? Did you need something?<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> Nothing in particular, but, I was watching you with Kanami-chan. You seem close.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> We sure are. As soon as we met in middle school, we were fast friends. We spend lots of time together, in classes and in the dorms.<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> Just like Karen-chan and I. Since the start of high school, we've always been together as roommates! Though now there's three of us, since Hikari-chan moved in.<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> What about Hiyori-chan? Her uniform is different, so she's from a different school, isn't she?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> We got to know Hiyori-chan during an incident at the tournament in our second year, and we've been friends ever since.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> It all started with Kanami-chan befriending Hiyori-chan.<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> So that's what happened.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Mai-chaaan, Tsuyuzaki-saaan! There's some aradama, so come over here!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> We should go.<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> Okay!<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> GGGIIII!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Tsuyuzaki-san, one of the aradama went that way! Could you get it!<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> GGIIIII!<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> It's a little... scary, but I'll do it!<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> EIIIIIII!!<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> There! Home run!<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> It looks like we just finished cleaning up the aradama too.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> The aradama's really gone... You're incredible, Mahiru-san.<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> It sort of looked like a ball, so I just gave it a good whack on reflex.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> That was only by reflex...?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> And not just that, but how you casually twirled around that weapon of yours like a baton as you fought...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> The way you moved... I think I could use it as reference in future fights.<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> It's sort of embarrassing hearing you talk like that, Mai-chan.<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> But, would it really be helpful learning from me?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I'd like to give it a try. Will you teach me how?<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> Mmm, but even if I teach you how to twirl a baton, it's not very useful for fighting, is it? I just somehow make it work...<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> I know! Mai-chan, could we try training like we're really fighting?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Of course, if that's alright with you.<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> Then, let's do it over there.<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> I love the shining stage, but I love seeing you shine even more. I want to dance with you forever, in a duet going round and round. 99th generation, Tsuyuzaki Mahiru.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> That line just now had such a stylish ring to it.<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> Ehehe, thank you. It makes me happy, hearing you say that. I get the feeling we're sort of alike, Mai-chan.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> We're alike?<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> But we can talk about that after!<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> Fighting might be more of your specialty, but come try me, Mai-chan!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Here I come!<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> Ah, but I would appreciate it if you'd go a little easy on me after all.<br><a href="https://mega.nz/file/lNQ1zYzR#aLAw1bVW8AeuquMf6OidutCAUkSJcGy2apIy0d4vQZY">https://mega.nz/file/lNQ1zYzR#aLAw1bVW8AeuquMf6OidutCAUkSJcGy2apIy0d4vQZY</a></p><h2 id="stage-girl---mai-end-i-love-seeing-you-shine-even-more" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Stage Girl - Mai: End]: I Love Seeing You Shine Even More</h2><p><strong>Mahiru:</strong> Phew... I worked up a good sweat.<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> How was that? I hope it was helpful getting to see it up close at least.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> It was. Though, I don't know if I'll be able to put it into practice straight away.<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> It would be difficult to use your okatana the same way I use my weapon, wouldn't it.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I think it's incredible enough that you can use that weapon like a baton, Tsuyuzaki-san!<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> You keep flattering me so much, Mai-chan~.  
<strong>Mai:</strong> Ah, by the way. Before we started training, you told me the two of us were alike?<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> Yeah, about that. I sort of had the feeling that the relationship between you, Kanami-chan, and Hiyori-chan was similar to us.<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> I told you earlier, but, I'm roommates with Karen-chan, and I love her and we've always been together.<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> But then... When we were in our second year of high school, Hikari-chan, Karen-chan's childhood friend, transferred in.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Now that you say that, it does feel a little alike.<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> At the time... I felt like Hikari-chan was stealing Karen-chan away from me... I felt really anxious for a while...<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> That's why, I know I'm being a busybody, but I was kind of worried about how things are for you.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Thank you for your concern. Though, I'm fine. Kanami-chan and Hiyori-chan are both close friends of mine.<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> I'm glad to hear it. Sorry, for asking you something so weird.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Not at all.<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> Ahh, even though I'm the older one here, I'm acting kind of presumptuous. You really feel more reliable, Mai-chan.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> That's not true; I'm still working on that myself.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Since we came to this world, you've worried about the troubles we're having more times than I can remember.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> You're like our reliable big sister.<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> Well, I am a big sister. I have a little sister and brother at home. Maybe it's because of them, but I always find myself wanting to help others.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Ah, I have two little sisters myself.<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> We're the same~.  
<strong>Mahiru:</strong> I don't mind going out of my way to help people, or I guess I should say, I just feel like I need to do something.<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> I used to help even more with Karen-chan in the past. Like helping her get out of bed in the mornings.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I can't help myself from taking care of things for my friends either. Though, sometimes they say I'm being overprotective...<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> Hmmm, but, if the person you're helping isn't bothered by it, isn't it alright?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> That's how I feel!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Good work, you two-.<br><strong>Karen:</strong> Mahiru-chan, you sorta look like you're getting along with Mai-chan. What were you talking about?<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> About how we tend to look after others, and how we're a little bit a like.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Now that you mention it, you might be similar to each other.<br><strong>Hikari:</strong> But when it comes to looking after others, I think you overdo it some.<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> If you could keep everything in order yourself, Hikari-chan, I wouldn't argue. Can you?<br><strong>Hikari:</strong> Nn...<br><strong>Karen:</strong> I want you to help with that, Mahiru-chan. Without you around, our room would look like a disaster zone.<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> You and Hikari-chan should make sure to tidy up after yourselves, Karen-chan~.  
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Hey, Mai-chan. I've got something I want to ask from you.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Like what? I'm all ears.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I was eating the sweets Daiba-san made earlier. And I started wanting to have some of your cookies.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> When we get back, could you make some for me...?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Mm, I'll make you some.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Nice-, thanks-!<br><a href="https://mega.nz/file/NM4zwCSI#e4j4XEndiYI-su2D4RvkAVQQEo9R8QnWAYoP7N47CGo">https://mega.nz/file/NM4zwCSI#e4j4XEndiYI-su2D4RvkAVQQEo9R8QnWAYoP7N47CGo</a></p><h2 id="mahouka---mirja-start-mirja-and-mayumi" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Mahouka - Mirja: Start]: Mirja and Mayumi</h2><p><strong>Mirja:</strong> ...I see, so that's what kind of magic you have, Saegusa Mayumi.<br><strong>Mayumi:</strong> That's it. At the Nine Schools Competition, I finished with a perfect bullseye. With a "bang!"  
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Going back, what is this Nine Schools Competition?<br><strong>Mayumi:</strong> Ah, that's right, you wouldn't have a Nine Schools Competition here.<br><strong>Mayumi:</strong> If I say it's... a competitive magic tournament, does that make it easy to picture?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Yes, that's easily understandable.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Hm... With that magic, you would be highly beneficial when fighting against aradama...<br><strong>Mayumi:</strong> Anyway, putting that aside, are you feeling peckish? It's about lunchtime, isn't it?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> You're right, now would be a good time for it.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Oh, that's... Asakura Mihono with Shiba Miyuki.<br><strong>Mayumi:</strong> They seem to be enjoying themselves quite a lot, though, I wonder what they're talking about?<br><strong>Mayumi:</strong> Let's go see, Kitora-san.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> You look like you're having a good time, Asakura Mihono.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah, Mirja-san, Mayumi-san!<br><strong>Mayumi:</strong> What were you talking about with Asakura-san, Miyuki-san?<br><strong>Miyuki:</strong> I was just speaking a little about Onii-sama.<br><strong>Mayumi:</strong> About Tatsuya-kun?<br><strong>Academy Announcement:</strong> An appearance of aradama has been confirmed. Please prepare to sortie at once. I repeat--<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Aradama!<br><strong>Mayumi:</strong> We'll lend a hand. Won't we, Miyuki-san?<br><strong>Miyuki:</strong> Yes, of course.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ...That would be helpful.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> In that case, Shiba Miyuki, I leave you with Asakura Mihono. Saegusa Mayumi will be with me.<br><strong>Mihono/Miyuki:</strong> Right.<br><strong>Mayumi:</strong> Will pairing off like this be alright?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> While magic may not be able to exorcise aradama, Shiba Miyuki's magic is effective against them.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Paired with Asakura Mihono, she should be able to cover for her, just in case.<br><strong>Mayumi:</strong> You really are considerate of your kouhai, aren't you, Kitora-san. I had pictured you as someone more logically driven.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Logically driven...? It's true that Asakura Mihono is a valuable member of our investigation team.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Though, Saegusa Mayumi. If I had left Asakura Mihono with you, I don't believe you would let anything go wrong either.<br><strong>Mayumi:</strong> I'm honored to hear it. Well, let's get going.<br><a href="https://mega.nz/file/5F5XSRBI#Qs4mPScbyWpABXm4FlDDqfKWd8HAgIzgppqgSK2W1-g">https://mega.nz/file/5F5XSRBI#Qs4mPScbyWpABXm4FlDDqfKWd8HAgIzgppqgSK2W1-g</a></p><h2 id="mahouka---mirja-start-elven-sniper" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Mahouka - Mirja: Start]: Elven Sniper</h2><p><strong>Mirja:</strong> Now then, Saegusa Mayumi. The two types of magic you explained to me before... Magic Bullet Shooter and Multi-Scope.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> With those two, we should be able to suppress aradama with ease.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> After all, you are capable of carrying out a one-sided assault on aradama from distance without needing to enter their range.<br><strong>Mayumi:</strong> That's true.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Then I will be the one to perform the finishing blow...<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> GGGGGOOOOOUUUUU!!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> -! Saegusa Mayumi!<br><strong>Mayumi:</strong> Of course.<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> GUOOO!?  
<strong>Aradama:</strong> GYAAA!?  
<strong>Aradama:</strong> OOOOO!?  
<strong>Mirja:</strong> She took care of three simultaneously..<br><strong>Mayumi:</strong> Two more are coming from the front, and another three from the right hand side. I'll pin them down, so could you please finish off those three?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I'm on it!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> HAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> (A perfect bullseye, hm... Her precision is frightening.)<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ...There's nothing that could be more reassuring.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> YAAAAAAAAAAAA!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> We finished suppressing the aradama, Mirja-san! Miyuki-san was really incredible!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> We can speak about that more later. Then, when we next meet.<br><strong>Mayumi:</strong> It sounds like Asakura-san and Miyuki-san safely suppressed their aradama too.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Yes, though Asakura Mihono's strange excitement has me concerned...<br><strong>Mayumi:</strong> You think she might have fallen in love with Miyuki-san's magic?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> That might be the case. Though, you were excellent yourself, Saegusa Mayumi.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I didn't think that, just by having long range support, it would make such a dramatic difference in efficiency...<br><strong>Mayumi:</strong> Would you try recreating it after you wake up from this dream?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> That would be difficult to accomplish. Multi-Scope and Magic Bullet Shooter.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I believe this was only possible because of how skilled you are at manipulating the both of them.<br><strong>Mayumi:</strong> Thank you for the compliments, Kitora-san.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I meant it.
