## [Misogi - Chie: Start] The Torn Ribbon
**Aradama:** KEEEEEEEEE\!  
**Chie:** HAAAAAA\!  
**Mihono:** Alriiight\! There's no more aradama around, so I think we're probably done here now\!  
**Chie:** ...Phew. Good work, everyone.  
**Kiyoka:** No, please be on your guard\! There's a reading on the spectrum finder\!  
**Aradama:** KUEEEEEEEE\!  
**Chie:** Kyah\!?  
**Kofuki:** I'm taking that aradama-chan\!  
**Mirja:** ...Musumi Kiyoka, are there any more readings on your spectrum finder?  
**Kiyoka:** ...They're all gone. That was honest to goodness the last of them this time.  
**Mihono:** Uu\~, because I went and said that... Are you okay, Chii-nee?  
**Chie:** It seems I was just a little more careless than I should have been.  
**Kofuki:** ...Nn? Chichie, you sure about that?  
**Chie:** Kofuki-chan?  
**Kofuki:** That's not what I mean\! It's just, you're acting kinda different than usual...  
**Kiyoka:** ...Ah\! Your ribbon\! Chie-san's ribbon is torn\!  
**Chie:** ...Sigh.  
**Mirja:** Setouchi Chie's usual spirit is gone... Was it that much of a shock to her?  
**Kofuki:** Guess even Chichie can get all depressed like that.  
**Kiyoka:** It's worrying... Hono-chan, have you ever seen Chie-san like that before?  
**Mihono:** Kind of. Way back when, Chii-nee used to cry really easy, and she'd get called crybaby Chii-chan.  
**Kiyoka/Kofuki:** Crybaby Chii-chan\!?  
**Chie:** Just now, I heard the word "crybaby"... Mihono-chan?  
**Mihono:** H-Huh? Was that something I wasn't supposed to tell anyone?  
**Kofuki:** Yo\! Crybaby Chii-chan\!  
**Chie:** ...Don't you think you're getting ahead of yourself?  
**Kofuki:** Yeah, yeah, that's how it should be. Chichie's gotta be mad if anything.  
**Chie:** I can't believe you. I'm feeling fine now, so, this whole... crybaby, thing, just forget about it\! Understand?  
**Kiyoka:** But, still... That ribbon is important to you, isn't it? It's you and Hono-chan's...  
**Chie:** That's right, it's very important to me. But... I can't stay moping around about it forever, can I?  
**Kiyoka:** Then... Let us give you a ribbon, as a present\! To thank you for always looking after us\!  
**Chie:** But, I do have other ribbons too... Sorry.  
**Kiyoka:** Even if you have more, that's still fine\! On the next day we have off, let's go buy one together\!  

## [Misogi - Chie: End]: Growing Treasures
**Kiyoka:** Chie-san, how about this ribbon? I think it would look good on you...  
**Chie:** I do think it's fine, but... Don't you think it's a little too cute for me?  
**Kofuki:** How about this one then? This one's not cute, which is perfect for you.  
**Chie:** I'm not sure I like that last part, but... This is nice too. Though, don't you think it's too flashy?  
**Kofuki:** You think? This's pretty normal.  
**Kiyoka:** I think both of them would suit you fine.  
**Chie:** Um... I suppose that's fine then, but...  
**Kofuki:** If you've got something you're looking for, then just say it. We can look for one of those.  
**Chie:** It's not exactly something I'm looking for, but... I'm so used to wearing my usual ribbon that it's embarrassing trying something else...  
**Kiyoka:** But that's such a waste\! Since we're here, let's try to get you a new ribbon\!  
**Chie:** F-Fine then. I'll... give it a try.  
**Kofuki:** Still, I wish we had a few more people here to come up with something.  
**Kiyoka:** There's no helping it. Hono-chan had something she had to take care of, and the others are all away on missions.  
**Kofuki:** Well, no use talking about who's not here, I guess. The two of us'll have to come up with something that'll fit Chichie.  
**Chie:** Thank you for coming out with me today, you two.  
**Chie:** But... I'm sorry. In the end, I wound up choosing a ribbon with a design like the one I already had.  
**Kiyoka:** Don't worry about that\! It was fun picking out a ribbon with you, Chie-san\!  
**Kofuki:** I mean, if you say that's what you want, then it's fine, right?  
**Kofuki:** That's what you're most used to, after all.  
**Chie:** Thank you... I'll take good care of it.  
**Chie:** Oh? Who could be stopping by this late?  
**Mihono:** Good, you're still up, Chii-nee\!  
**Chie:** Mihono-chan? Why are you here? I thought you had gone back home today...  
**Mihono:** Yeah, I just got back. So anyway-- Here, I got you a present\!  
**Chie:** ...A ribbon? Don't tell me... When you said you had something to take care of today, you were fixing this...  
**Mihono:** Ah, no, that's not it. Actually, when I first got this ribbon, it came in a set of two.  
**Chie:** ...It did?  
**Mihono:** When you look that surprised about it, it's kinda awkward.  
**Mihono:** And anyway, think about it. If you were going to split the same ribbon between two people, wouldn't you normally just buy two of the same ribbon?  
**Chie:** That's... true, I suppose. But, if you had this, then... Why did we split one ribbon in two back then?  
**Mihono:** I thought, if we did it that way, then you wouldn't forget about me.  
**Chie:** ...Of all things. Even if you hadn't done that, you know I could never forget about you.  
**Chie:** So then, you went back home to get this?  
**Mihono:** Yeah. I'd totally forgotten where I'd left it, so it took me all this time to find.  
**Mihono:** But... Chii-nee. This one's also the real ribbon from back then.  
**Mihono:** Will you take it?  
**Chie:** ...Thank you, Mihono-chan.  
**Chie:** The ribbon I got from the others... And this ribbon too, and the torn ribbon as well... These are all my treasures.
