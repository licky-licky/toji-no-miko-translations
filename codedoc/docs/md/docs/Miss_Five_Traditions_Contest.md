## 1: Aiming to Be the Toji Representative
**Maki:** Yukari-sama. Shidou Maki and Konohana Suzuka have arrived.  
**Yukari:** Good, you're here.  
**Yukari:** I'll explain to you the details concerning a great project about to be put underway.  
**Yukari:** We received an offer from an international organization to appoint a "Toji Representative", to be an ambassador of peace and goodwill toward the world.  
**Maki:** A toji representative...\!?  
**Yukari:** This is a sign that the world has begun to recognize the accomplishments of toji.  
**Suzuka:** By what manner will we be deciding on the toji representative?  
**Yukari:** I've received a list of referrals for prospective candidates from each president of the Five Traditions.  
**Yukari:** From the Minoseki Academy: Inago, Etou, Yanase, Asakura.  
**Yukari:** From the Heijou Institute: Juujou, Iwakura, Musumi.  
**Yukari:** From Osafune Girls' Academy: Setouchi, Kohagura, Mashiko.  
**Yukari:** From Renpu Girls' School: Ban, Shichinosato, Itomi.  
**Yukari:** From Ayanokouji Martial Arts School: Kitora, Yamashiro.  
**Yukari:** From the elite guard: Shidou, Konohana, Satsuki, Tsubakuro.  
**Yukari:** To decide on a representative from the aforementioned members, we will hold a "Miss Five Traditions" Selection Tournament.  
**Maki:** A... Miss Five Traditions Selection Tournament?  
**Yukari:** The judging will be divided into three categories.  
**Yukari:** To compete in the beauty of their swordsmanship, a "performance". To display a toji's indispensable organizational skills, a "group examination". To express their feelings regarding their services toward society, a "speech".  
**Yukari:** It would only be fitting to call the one who gains the most support through all categories "Miss Five Traditions"; someone who can act as an ambassador of spirit, vitality, and peace to the youth of the world.  
**Maki:** It would certainly be a total test of one's talents as a toji then...  
**Maki:** As members of the elite guard, we can't afford to give a bad example here, can we, Suzuka.  
**Suzuka:** That's true. This is a fine opportunity to demonstrate to the public our regular dedication to improving ourselves.  
**Yukari:** I will be there as well, on the day of the competition. I have high expectations that the nominated toji will put their best efforts.  
After Yukari announced the details of the "Miss Five Traditions" Selection Tournament, word spread in a flash among the toji.

  
**Mihono:** Being an ambassador of peace toward the world sounds kinda amazing, doesn't it\!  
**Mihono:** And also, I'm really happy everyone in the investigation team got chosen as "Miss Five Traditions" candidates too.  
**Mihono:** Cause, this means all the effort we're putting in is getting recognized\!  
**Mirja:** There's no doubt that we have gained a certain value to our reputation.  
**Mirja:** And, at the same time "Miss Five Traditions" will be decided upon, the morale of toji will be raised... This is a well thought out event.  
**Mihono:** I'll give my best shot at becoming "Miss Five Traditions"-\! It might be tough, but, where there's a will, there's a way-\!  
**Chie:** Fufu. Seeing you ready to give it your all like that, I can't let myself be outdone here.  
**Yui:** The selection tournament is going to have a, "Badump-\! A great big all girls sports day\!" feeling, right? I mean, of course it'll be like that\!  
**Mirja:** You would be wrong. In the first place, they already announced the categories they will be judging us on.  
**Mirja:** You should look over them as soon as you can, Yamashiro Yui. Every toji will likely be taking this seriously.  
**Akira:** Yo.  
**Kaoru:** Yo-, didn't expect to run into you here.  
**Ellen:** That reminds me, I saw the list of candidates for "Miss Five Traditions".  
**Ellen:** You were picked out for it too, weren't you? I was surprised to see you joining in an event like this.  
**Akira:** Yeah-. I wasn't sure if I'd be doing it, or whatever.  
**Kaoru:** Makes you want to do anything to get out of it, huh-. I get that feeling.  
**Kaoru:** Hey, how about we skip the day of the tournament together?  
**Akira:** Y'know, I'm not into that type of half-assed attitude.  
**Akira:** We got picked out of the whole Five Traditions. And that means we've gotta put in a good showing for the rest of everybody else.  
**Kaoru:** S-Sure. Didn't expect you to be so serious about this.  
**Akira:** (The higher ups didn't put their foot down for this tournament... Which should mean it's fine if I go.)  
**Akira:** (So, why not go wild with it\!)  
And thus, each harboring their own respective feelings, the toji came to compete for the position of "Miss Five Traditions".

  

## 2: Let the "Miss Five Traditions" Selection Tournament Begin\!
And so, the day of the "Miss Five Traditions" Selection Tournament came.

  
**Mihono:** Mmm-, today's the perfect day for a tournament\!  
**Mihono:** I'll give it my best shot at becoming "Miss Five Traditions", yeah-\!  
**Announcement:** Inago Akira-san. If you have arrived at the tournament hall, please let the administrator's office know at once--  
**Kofuki:** Huhh, so somebody's not even here yet. Actually, that should've been me.  
**Kofuki:** Let me hunt some aradama instead of playing along with this junk-.  
At that moment.

  
**Akira:** Ah-... I'm for sure getting stuck in traffic here.  
**Akira:** And after I went outta my way to leave at a different time. No use. Guess I'll try a back road.  
**Akira:** The tournament's gonna be starting around now. I've gotta hurry--  
**Announcer:** Now then, the first round of judging, "Performance" will hereby begin.  
**Mihono:** Alright, it's finally starting\! Let's make it a good competition, guys\!  
**Kanami:** Yeah\! I'm going out there then\!  
**Kanami:** HAAAAH--\!  
**Mihono:** Kanami, that's amazing...\!  
**Kiyoka:** Her performance is beautiful, like she's flowing through the motions... I can't take my eyes off her.  
**Chie:** But along with that, her movements look so sharp they could slice the air apart. She's naturally gifted, isn't she...  
**Sayaka:** That's how good Kanami is. But, I won't lose.  
**Yukina:** Sayaka. Show everyone in the hall the might of Renpu Girls' School.  
**Sayaka:** I will.  
**Sayaka:** HAA--\!  
**Yukina:** The toji here couldn't possibly compete with Sayaka.  
**Kanami:** That was a great performance, Sayaka-chan\!  
**Sayaka:** Thank you.  
**Announcer:** Please pardon this interruption of the judging. Inago Akira-san. If you have arrived at the tournament hall, please let the administrator's office know at once--  
**Akira:** Like I figured, this way's got hardly any traffic. I might make it only a bit late now...  
**Akira:** Huh? My tire popped\!? I'm still nowhere near the tournament either\!  
**Akira:** Am I supposed to push now... Damnit...  
**Kiyoka:** It's going to be my turn soon... I-It's making me nervous...  
**Chie:** You'll don't have to work yourself up over it so much, Kiyoka-chan.  
**Chie:** After all, this isn't a battle, so how about you show them just how much you've grown?  
**Kiyoka:** Chie-san...  
**Chie:** Anyway, I have to go out now. Please cheer me on.  
**Chie:** After the advice I gave Kiyoka-chan, as her onee-san, I'll have to give it my best attempt.  
**Chie:** HAA--\!  
**Kiyoka:** Wow, she's incredible...  
**Mihono:** You can do it, Chii-nee\!  
**Kiyoka:** From watching Chie-san's performance, I feel like I've calmed down a little... But, my heart still won't stop racing.  
**Kiyoka:** I have to do a performance here, in front of all these people...  
**Kofuki:** Can't you just do whatever out there? You take this stuff so seriously.  
**Kofuki:** Actually, I'm up next, aren't I? This's lame, so maybe I'll bail.  
**Kiyoka:** Y-You're going to leave\!? Please don't go...\!  
**Kofuki:** Why not. Isn't it all the same if I'm here or not?  
**Kiyoka:** But... It makes me feel, discouraged...  
**Kofuki:** Tch... Fine, whatever. I just have to go out there, right?  
**Kofuki:** What's so fun about this waste of time... Here goes.  
**Kofuki:** That good enough for you? Aghh-, so lame.  
**Mihono:** Uwah-... Fukki, you didn't even try at all, did you.  
**Chie:** It was very like her though... Ah, Kiyoka-chan's performance is next.  
**Kiyoka:** [inhale, exhale]... [inhale, exhale]...  
**Kiyoka:** (Thanks to Kofuki-san, I feel like I can be a little braver...)  
**Kiyoka:** (If my friends are here with me, then I know, even I can do it...\!)  
**Kiyoka:** Here I go...\!  
**Mihono:** Ooh-... Way to go, Kiyoka\!  
**Chie:** Mm, it was a nice performance that expressed all the effort she's put in.  
**Kofuki:** If she was gonna go and do all that, why couldn't she just do it from the start.  
**Kiyoka:** Ah, Kofuki-san\!  
**Kiyoka:** I was able to try my best because you stayed... Thank you very much\!  
**Kofuki:** Hey, I've got nothing to do with this.  
**Mihono:** Isn't the last performance yours, Konohana-san? Good luck out there\!  
**Suzuka:** Fufu, thank you. Well then, I'll be going.  
**Suzuka:** So in a showcase of the beauty cultivated in our swordsmanship, I'll be last to perform...  
**Suzuka:** As an elite guard, as a toji, I can hardly put on a shameful performance now.  
**Suzuka:** Konohana Suzuka will now begin-- HAAH\!  
**Kiyoka:** Woww... Her performance is so elegant...  
**Chie:** When they say, "to flow like water", I suppose this is exactly what they mean... What else can you expect from the elite guard.  
**Mihono:** Yeah... With how great all the performances were, it wouldn't be crazy if anybody won\!  

## 3: School Separated Opposition Battle
**Announcer:** Continuing on, everyone will be divided by their respective schools so they may display their tactics as a unit in this "group examination".  
**Announcer:** Now then, ready, start\!  
**Yume:** Ahahahahah\! Here I go-\!  
**Toji A:** Tsubakuro Yume of the elite guard is moving up quickly\!  
**Toji B:** If we draw her out here, we can finish this\! All members, forward\!  
**Yume:** Hmmm, so you're trying to outnumber me. That's fine.  
**Yume:** I'll tear through you one by one-- I'll show off just what makes me so great\!  
**Maki:** That's our Yume. Even surrounded by toji from other schools, she treats it like it's nothing.  
**Suzuka:** Though, I feel leaving things as they are won't give room to gauge our organizational skills.  
**Maki:** No need to worry about that. The strength of the elite guard isn't just in those who push out.  
**Yomi:** There is an ambush waiting behind the cover ahead. I'll attack pre-emptively.  
**Toji C:** Kh, we got spotted...? Uwahhh\!  
**Yume:** Thanks, Yomi-onee-san\!  
**Yomi:** You don't need to thank me. I only did what I needed to, as an elite guard.  
**Maki:** Yume's wild movements, and Yomi's precise support of her. That's just another part of group tactics, isn't it?  
**Suzuka:** We can't simply stay here admiring them either. We need to move up as well.  
**Maki:** Right, let's go\!  
**Mai:** If we hold them off at the front line here, the momentum will push toward the elite guard--  
**Mai:** Kanami-chan, keep Tsubakuro-san back\!  
**Kanami:** I'm on it-\!  
**Yume:** Onee-san\!  
**Kanami:** I'm not letting you go any further, Yume-chan\!  
**Yume:** Ahahah, this is fun, right\!  
**Kanami:** Yeah\!  
**Mai:** I can see a group appraching from the south-- All members, spread out into two units\!  
**Mai:** Leave this here to Kanami-chan and perform a pincer attack to the south\! Mihono-chan, take care of the other unit\!  
**Mihono:** Got it-\!  
**Ema:** Yanase-san is as resourceful as always. With her control over myougan, she can give commands based on her understanding of the situation in all directions.  
**Ema:** When put in charge of a raiding unit, I don't know that any toji could get the better of her.  
**Mihono:** The toji over there still haven't noticed me yet...  
**Mihono:** Which means, first come, first serve-\! TAAAAH-\!  
**Toji A:** A-A surprise attack\!?  
**Toji B:** They're counterattacking\! Intercept-\!  
**Mihono:** Too late-\!  
**Mihono:** Kanami and Mai are both pretty great, aren't they... You can tell, standing on the same battlefield as them.  
**Mihono:** I can't let them beat me either\!  
**Mirja:** The battle is becoming more chaotic... Ayanokouji's line is falling back.  
**Mirja:** Don't falter, Kitora Unit\! Suzumoto Hana, Hasui Mayumi, take the vanguard and push the battle forward\!  
**Mirja:** Nakano Jun, preserve the main unit; Yamashiro Yui, guard the rear\!  
**Yui:** Yes ma'aaam-\!  
**Yuzuki:** --So they've rallied from a disadvantageous position.  
**Yuzuki:** Commands issued with faith in each member, arranging the unit to best make use of their skills-- Just as I've come to expect of you, Mirja.  
**Kaoru:** Oh...? Those guys from Ayanokouji, they've started fighting the ones from Renpu.  
**Kaoru:** Osafune Squad, take the chance to run away-. We don't have to fight a pointless fight here.  
**Toji A:** R-Right\!  
**Sana:** Hey, don't take the initiative to run when you're the commander\!  
**Sana:** Though, considering it's Kaoru, she probably won't come away without gaining anything...  
**Ellen:** Are you sure about this, Kaoru? You're going to get a talking to from Sana-sensei later.  
**Kaoru:** It's fine; this is just thinking two steps ahead is all-.  
**Kaoru:** See, now Heijou Institute's unit's in shambles. If we move over there, we can create an opening.  
**Kaoru:** So anyway, go get 'em-.  
**Toji A:** H-Huh? Osafune Unit is moving here at speed\!  
**Chie:** Please don't think too badly of us for this. YAAA-\!  
**Hiyori:** --I'm not about to let you.  
**Chie:** Juujou-san...\!  
**Ellen:** Hiyoyon\!  
**Kiyoka:** I-I'll back you up, Juujou-san...\!  
**Hiyori:** Thanks. Come on, let's make our counterattack.  
**Toji A:** Renpu Unit is approaching from the right\!  
**Sanae:** Understood\! If we can stop them here, Renpu Unit should run out of steam...  
**Sanae:** Take a close formation with our backs to the wall\! We'll withstand this and find a good opportunity\!  
**Toji A:** Right-\!  
**Iroha:** That's the way. By restricting the enemy's space to move, you won't be so easily broken through...  
**Iroha:** To find victory from defense is a very appropriate style of fighting for her.  
**Ema:** The state of the battle is getting awfully mixed up.  
**Sana:** Now then, whose side is it going to turn in favor of?  

## 4: Put Your Feelings in Your Speech
**Announcer:** The third judging category will be a speech. Your speech's theme will be: "What you hope to accomplish as a toji."  
**Announcer:** Please share with us your dreams, as well as your thoughts regarding your contributions to society.  
**Mihono:** What we hope to accomplish as toji...  
**Maki:** This is Shidou Maki, first seat of the elite guard.  
**Maki:** As a toji, what I hope to accomplish is to reach a future where everyone can laugh together.  
**Maki:** The threat posed by aradama still runs deep, and I understand it won't be as simple as it sounds.  
**Maki:** Even still, I have many allies with me here. There have been harsh battles I was able to overcome only because of the friends I had at my side.  
**Maki:** And, as an elite guard, I've come to understand how admirable it is to protect you all.  
**Maki:** I believe a great future is waiting ahead for us... And I intend to keep walking the path toward it. That's all. Thank you for listening.  
**Mihono:** Ohh\~... Shidou-san did as good as you'd expect\! She's got the attitude of a first seat-\!  
**Yui:** That was too beautiful\! I knew it; I love Maki-san too\! Okay, now it's my turn\!  
**Mihono:** Good luck, Yui\!  
**Yui:** I'm Yamashiro Yui, a second year in the middle school division at Ayanokouji Martial Arts School.  
**Yui:** There's something that's been on my mind this whole time, ever since the first day I became a toji.  
**Yui:** And that's... All these girls who're toji, they're all so cute\!  
**Yui:** There's good looking girls of every type, and their serious faces when they're fighting are so dreamy... Don't you think this situation is just too perfect?  
**Mihono:** Yui... Even in a place like this, she doesn't change.  
**Yui:** And, what I enjoy most of all is getting in the baths with everyone\!  
**Yui:** I get to relax in there, charge up my energy, and we can do this and that to deepen our friendship\! You know, this and that-\!  
**Yui:** Getting to be surrounded by alllll these amazing girls, I'm the happiest person in the world\!  
**Yui:** Miku. I don't know how exactly it'll get to you, but I know you're going to hear this speech, won't you?  
**Yui:** Like you heard me say, I'm doing just fine. Because I'm having fun doing my job as a toji.  
**Yui:** Ah, about Miku, she's my super cute little sister\! That's all-\!  
**Tsugumi:** That was a nice speech.  
**Yui:** Thank you very much, Tsugumi-san\!  
**Tsugumi:** Hello. I'm Ban Tsugumi, a second year in Renpu Girls' School's high school division.  
**Tsugumi:** Ordinarily, I work with the aradama research team I'm a part of.  
**Tsugumi:** I compile information to build a database on aradama, and occasionally go to collect data myself.  
**Tsugumi:** Unlike the other girls, I may be poor at expressing myself, but I am surrounded by a supportive team and curious colleagues.  
**Tsugumi:** Many times have I been brought out to support these unthinkable friends of mine, however... I don't think those days are so bad.  
**Tsugumi:** In the days to come, I'd like to continue gathering much more data.  
**Mihono:** Tsugumi-san, you said you couldn't express yourself, but... I thought you expressed yourself really well\!  
**Tsugumi:** I know. That was a bit of humor.  
**Hiyori:** Third year in middle school at the Heijou Institute. Juujou Hiyori.  
**Hiyori:** I'm honestly not very good with this sort of thing, but... I think I'll talk a little about myself today.  
**Hiyori:** Ever since I can remember, I've done nothing but train my skills.  
**Hiyori:** I spent my days pursuing only strength and my own ideals. I thought that would go on always.  
**Hiyori:** But, now... My days are far more fulfilling than I ever could have imagined back then.  
**Hiyori:** And that's all because of the allies I have with me. No, I guess I should call them my friends.  
**Hiyori:** Rather than only working to improve myself, I can feel that finding the time to laugh together over foolish things is just as important.  
**Hiyori:** Every day I find a new side of myself that even I never realized was there.  
**Hiyori:** There will probably be lots of changes in my future, and maybe that's what people call growing up. But I'm also looking forward to seeing what "new me" will come next.  
**Ellen:** Nn\~, that was a good speech, Hiyoyon\! I'm going to have to try to to be outdone\!   
**Ellen:** Ah-, test, test. I'm Kohagura Ellen, a first year in high school at Osafune Girls' Academy\!  
**Ellen:** This has to do with the theme of, "what you hope to accomplish as a toji," but I'm going to start with a quick story.  
**Ellen:** When I was little, I always couldn't wait to hear what stories Grandma would tell me.  
**Ellen:** With a dream forming in my young heart, you could say it was only natural I would yearn to see the Japan filled with wonders I had heard about.  
**Ellen:** And, when I came to Japan... It was a wonderland even greater than I had pictured\! I felt inspired by the okatana wielding toji--  
**Ellen:** And, seeing up close the friendship that could be formed between people and aradama, I thought, how fantastic is that\!  
**Ellen:** The dream I've always had was to make an aradama park and tours of the netherworld a reality.  
**Ellen:** It might be a faraway dream at this point, but I'll absolutely make it come true someday\!  
**Mihono:** Everyone's speeches are so great...   
**Mihono:** Just from listening to them, I've feeling hyped up too\!  
**Ellen:** Okay, Mihomiho. You're the last to go\!  
**Mihono:** Right-\!  
**Mihono:** Umm, I'm Asakura Mihono, a second year in middle school at the Minoseki Academy.  
**Mihono:** This might seem out of nowhere, but my motto is, "Leap before you look\!"  
**Mihono:** With my job as a toji, and with this okatana... I've done my best so far thinking I might have the power to make somebody happy.  
**Mihono:** I've seen lots of tough enemies, and been through lots of close calls.  
**Mihono:** But, during those times, what kept me going was one thought deep in my heart.  
**Mihono:** I don't know how to say anything that sounds great yet. But, still\!  
**Mihono:** Maybe I can't understand all the hard stuff, but I'll keep trying my best every day\!  
**Mihono:** Whatever trouble I run into, together with my friends, I've been able to leap before I look out of it.  
**Mihono:** From now on, so long as I'm with everyone, I know I'll be able to go as far as I can-- Because I believe, "where there's a will, there's a way\!"  
**Yui:** You stole it away at the end, Mihono-chan. That hit the spot\!  
**Maki:** True. The volume of the applause shows you just how much the audience expects of Asakura Mihono.  

## 5: Whose Hand Will Take the Glory
After all the judging had been concluded, the toji each waited for the results to be announced.

  
**Kanami:** You all did great, everybody-\!  
**Mai:** You too. We've done all we can now.  
**Mai:** It's good we were able to have such a satisfying tournament, since we did the best we could with our current ability.  
**Kanami:** It was neat getting to learn things about each other I never knew before too\!  
**Hiyori:** I get the feeling I talked a bit too much though...  
**Sanae:** Really? I thought it was great to hear.  
**Kaoru:** This whole tournament was just an excuse to get us to work unpaid overtime, wasn't it-. Feels like working over the weekend.  
**Ellen:** Now now, Kaoru. Making wonderful memories like these is priceless.  
**Mai:** Sayaka-chan, good work on your performance. You must be hungry, aren't you?  
**Sayaka:** Mm, a little.  
**Mai:** I baked cookies, so here. If you'd all like, why don't we all share them together?  
**Kanami:** Can we? Thanks, Mai-chan\! I'll have some-\!  
**Kofuki:** Sigh, that's fiiinally over with. Oi, get some aradama-chan ready for me.  
**Tsugumi:** Understood. Please give me a moment.  
**Kiyoka:** You two have gone right back to usual, haven't you.  
**Kiyoka:** Umm-, aren't you curious about the results being announced?  
**Kofuki:** Yeah right. It's not like I even planned on becoming "Miss Five Traditions" in the first place.  
**Kiyoka:** What about if you were chosen, Tsugumi-san...?  
**Tsugumi:** It would cut into the time I have for research, so I would want to turn it down.  
**Kiyoka:** (That's how they both are... But, if I were chosen, what would I do...?)  
**Kiyoka:** (It's no use\! After all, I know someone like me could never become "Miss Five Traditions"... But, still\~...\!)  
**Yui:** Who do you think it'll be-; "Miss Five Traditions\!"  
**Yui:** They'd probably get a bunch of cute outfits and things for her, right?  
**Mirja:** I doubt those would be anything like the outfits you're imagining, Yamashiro Yui.  
**Chie:** Mihono-chan, with how good your speech was, you might even be picked to be "Miss Five Traditions".  
**Mihono:** Ehh-, you think so? But, everybody else's were great too, and yours was amazing, Chii-nee, so I think it wouldn't be weird if anybody won\!  
**Mihono:** What'd really make me happy is if somebody from the investigation team ended up getting picked as the winner\!  
**Mihono:** Ah-, now that I'm thinking about it, my heart won't stop pounding. I can't wait to see the results-\!  
**Chie:** Fufu, I know what you mean... Oh?  
**Chie:** Look, outside. A girl is pushing a motorcycle up.  
**Akira:** [pant, pant]... I'm here, damnit...  
**Akira:** Though, it'll for sure be over at this point... Aghh-...  
**Yume:** Hmmm, I wonder if I showed off enough to the judges.  
**Maki:** Sure you did. Though, while appealing to the judges is important for getting chosen to be "Miss Five Traditions", your general accomplishments as a toji are also taken into account.  
**Maki:** Considering the toji that were entered in the competition, everyone should still have a chance.  
**Suzuka:** I've done all that I can. The rest is in the hands of fate.  
**Yomi:** Everyone, I've prepared omusubi if you'd like.  
**Yume:** Yaaay, I'll have some-\!  
**Announcer:** Thank you very much for waiting. The one selected to be "Miss Five Traditions" is...  
You will decide who becomes Miss Five Traditions\! By all means, please vote for your favorite toji\!

  
**Other:** Keep Watching to See My Even Greater Side\! \~Miss Five Traditions\~

**Announcer:** Tsubakuro Yume-san\!\!  
**Announcer:** Congratulations on your victory\! Please tell us how you are feeling now\!  
**Yume:** Thanks for picking me to be "Miss Five Traditions"\!  
**Yume:** But, I can be even greater than this\! I'll show you even more of how great I am, so look forward to it\!  
**Announcer:** Thank you for your comments\! We'll look forward to seeing your efforts in the future\!

## [Dress 20 - Mihono: Start]: I Want to Throw a Thank You Party\!
**Mihono:** Let's throw a thank you party for the Miss Five Traditions competition\! Everybody tried really hard, so, no matter how it turns out, let's thank them\!  
**Mihono:** Or something like that\!  
**Kofuki:** Fine by me?  
**Chie:** Then, I'll make us some food.  
**Mihono:** Chii-nee's gonna cook\!  
**Mihono:** ...But wait, why don't we just go do karaoke?  
**Mihono:** I do want to eat Chii-nee's cooking, but I want it to be something more casual and fun where we can let loose.  
**Chie:** Fufu, you're just being considerate. Karaoke, hm. I'll look forward to it.  
**Mirja:** That's right, I'll have to tune my throat beforehand.  
**Yui:** I can't wait to hear Mirja-san's singing\! Let's sing a duet together\!  
**Kiyoka:** Are you only going to be inviting the investigation team?  
**Mihono:** Since we're doing this, I want to reach out to Kanami and them too.  
**Kiyoka:** It would be more fun with everyone going, won't it? I'll talk to Juujou-san.  
**Chie:** Then, I'll ask Kaoru-san and Ellen-san. Tsugumi-san, can you speak to Itomi-san about it?  
**Tsugumi:** Understood. I'll ask Itomi-san.  
**Mihono:** Alright-, Kiyoka, Yui, Fukki-\! Let's go do karaoke now\! We've gotta build up our stock of songs\!  
**Mihono:** Wait, that was what we talked about, so why'd it turn into a party at such a fancy place\!?  
**Kanami:** I heard the elite guard and Yukari-sama found out about it, and it sounds like Yukari-sama decided to hold a great big party to thank everyone.  
**Mihono:** Our karaoke meetup turned into a real party\!  
**Mihono:** Hey, Kanami\! Since Yukari-sama did this, that means she had to have gotten some yummy food for us, right\!  
**Mihono:** Mmmm, I can't wait\!  
**Kanami:** I know what you mean, Mihono-chan.  
**Mai:** Kanami-chan, Mihono-chan, it seems like they have dresses ready for us over there.  
**Mihono:** She got us dresses too\!? Let's go quick, Kanami\!  
**Kanami:** Ah, wait up, Mihono-chan\!?  
**Mai:** You don't have to be in such a rush you two; they have enough for everyone...  
**Mai:** They're already gone.  
**Sayaka:** Mai?  
**Mai:** Oh, Sayaka-chan.  
**Sayaka:** Kanami and Mihono were running. Did something happen?  
**Mai:** Nothing's happened, you don't have to worry. More importantly, what did you need?  
**Sayaka:** I came to get you.  
**Mai:** Thank you. I'm looking forward to seeing the dresses.  
**Sayaka:** Mm.  

## [Dress 20 - Mihono: End]: Earrings and a Necklace
**Kiyoka:** Hono-chan, I'm going on ahead.  
**Mihono:** Okay-, I'll be out in a minute.  
**Kiyoka:** Alright\!  
**Mihono:** (It's just me and Itomi-san left, huh.)  
**Mihono:** (I just need to put this ear piercing in, and... There\! It's all set\!)  
**Mihono:** Okay, Itomi-san, I'm going to get going too now.  
**Sayaka:** ...  
**Mihono:** Itomi-san? What's wrong?  
**Sayaka:** I can't attach this necklace right.  
**Mihono:** Necklace?  
**Mihono:** ...Ah.  
**Sayaka:** I'll be okay, so you can go, Mihono.  
**Mihono:** Since I'm already here, let's go together. Could I see your necklace? I'll put it on for you.  
**Sayaka:** ...Okay.  
**Mihono:** Doing this much is no big deal. And besides, this necklace; it's cute, isn't it\!  
**Sayaka:** Thank you, Mihono. Your earrings are cute too.  
**Mihono:** Ahaha, thanks\! There, it's on\!  
**Mihono:** Okay, let's go\!  
**Sayaka:** Mm.  
**Mihono:** Huh, did somebody come back? I'm coming-.  
**Mihono:** Chii-nee and Mai?  
**Chie:** I thought, if you were still getting ready, I could give a hand, but... It looks like you're fine.  
**Mai:** You look like you're finished too, Sayaka-chan.  
**Mai:** ...Mmhm, you look very cute.  
**Sayaka:** Thank you, Mai.  
**Sayaka:** Mihono put this necklace on for me.  
**Mai:** I see; Wasn't that nice of her.  
**Sayaka:** Mm.  
**Chie:** So you were late because you were helping Itomi-san finish up.  
**Mihono:** There was that too, but it's mostly because I couldn't decide what earrings to go with. What do you think of these?  
**Chie:** I like them; they look great on you, Mihono-chan.  
**Mihono:** Ehehe, I'm glad to hear it then\! Okay-, let's all go out to the party\!
