Why is the self-defense force going after the submarine Yukari-sama and Ichikishimahime are on...?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> It's highly likely that President Takatsu has been influencing things behind closed doors.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Then, President Takatsu got close to government officials so she could get the self-defense force involved...?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> I don't get all the details, but the important part is, we're in trouble, right?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> We are...

There is a possibility that her phone's signal could broadcast her location to President Takatsu, after all.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Then that means, until we get an idea of where to go, we're waiting here...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> We can't just stand around! Let's follow our intuition for now!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Your intuition? Hono-chan...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Nah, I'm with Mihocchi here.

It sounds as though she's already taken that into consideration.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> However, the government is watching closely, so she has asked us to cause as little of a commotion as possible.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ...As well as that, if we encounter any imperial guard during our search, we should expect to fight again.

Are you fine with dying leaving that undone?<br><strong>Ichikishima:</strong> A desire...<br><strong>Ichikishima:</strong> I desired to sublimate humanity to greater heights through fusion with aradama, at one point.<br><strong>Ichikishima:</strong> But none would desire such lofty ideals...<br><strong>Ichikishima:</strong> I had hoped to prove my existence was not unnecessary... But I am tired.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Then you're giving up?<br><strong>Ichikishima:</strong> None around me will forgive me.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> I see. Though that means nothing to me.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Whether or not anyone forgives you, I made up my mind to protect you.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Even if they all wanted otherwise, I would never give you to Tagitsuhime.<br><strong>Ichikishima:</strong> Yukari...<br><strong>Imperial Guard A:</strong> Everyone, target sighted!

We can get some rest at last.<br><strong>Ichikishima:</strong> ...I cannot understand. Why won't you break?<br><strong>Ichikishima:</strong> For these twenty years, we were with you. And yet, as we wore away at you, you endured it all.<br><strong>Ichikishima:</strong> From where do you find it? That strength of yours?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> You want to know? Then I'll tell you.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> You won't be able to understand just by watching, so speak with me.<br><strong>Ichikishima:</strong> Communicating intent through conversation...?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> As you've said, humanity is immature. Thinking we can understand each other without conversation is nonsense.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> From speaking with you... For example, I was surprised to find how unexpectedly talkative you are.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> I thought you would be the silent type... Frankly, I was puzzled at first.<br><strong>Ichikishima:</strong> Mm...<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> I'm not very good at it myself, but this is how humans come to understand each other.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> --Though, saying that, it can be a problem when someone comes to understand you too well.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Only you could have traced me this far. --Yuzuki.<br><strong>Yuzuki:</strong> ...Only because you're easy to figure out, Yukari.<br><strong>Other:</strong> Justified Scrutiny<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Come on, onee-sans!

She's not yet in good shape.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> But who knows what she'd get up to if we forced her to rest.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> She's quite the troublemaker, isn't she.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> It actually feels better having her where I can see her. Especially at a time like this.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Though it's true that her health is coming back to her. This is a good chance to see how well she's recovered.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> You have a point. But we have to make sure we don't lose sight of her.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Naturally. What a handful she can be, honestly.
