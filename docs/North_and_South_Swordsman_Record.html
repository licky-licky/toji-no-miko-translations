She's gotten better at MCing since last time, and when I went to shake her hand, she even remembered me!<br><strong>Suu:</strong> And Sonomiya Eden-san winked at me too; this seriously made all the painful missions I've had to go through up till now worth it-!     [The kanji in their names are puns on Noah's Ark and the Garden of Eden]<br><strong>Asahina Hokuto:</strong> ......Right.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> They're trying so hard...<br><strong>Suu:</strong> You don't know how lucky we are we got tickets for such good seats. That's all thanks to you applying for the lottery for us, Hokuto-san!<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Ah, what did you think, anyway? About Garden's mini-live concert!<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> This was my first time seeing an idol concert, so it felt very fresh...<br><strong>Suu:</strong> I'm glad you liked it then~. I'll give you the CD and scarf towel I bought in case I could turn someone into a future fan!<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> Ah... Thank you. You really like those girls, don't you. I hadn't heard of these idols at all before though.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Garden still has that feeling like, only those in the know know how good they are, so I'm not surprised-.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Early on, the two of them both wanted to go solo, so they couldn't get along. Garden back then... You could say it was more of a wasteland.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> But, after all the times they fought, you can see now just how well they get together.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> Even though they fought, they turned out alright?<br><strong>Suu:</strong> They did! At first, Noa-chan and Eden-san used to be so serious about their idol activities, and apparently they got in lots of arguments over where to take their careers.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> They said that, in order to decide who'd lead them, they had a bunch of battles, like, who could get the highest score in karaoke, or who could hold a smile the longest.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> But, as they did that, it made them start understanding each other better! Isn't that so idol-like!<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> I don't exactly know... what is and isn't idol-like. But it's true that battling can be a way to bring people together.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> That whole story was another reason why I became a fan of theirs.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> I want to watch over them until the day they spread their wings and make it out into the big open sky of showbiz!<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Doesn't seeing cute girls sing and dance just fill you with energy!<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> ...I think I understand you somewhat. It's the fruit of their efforts.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> After that... With the Renpu and Heijou joint-practice starting in three days...<br><strong>Suu:</strong> I think I might be able to make it... maybe... somehow.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> Be more assertive. Where did the energy you got from those girls go?<br><strong>Suu:</strong> I already used it all up. Ever since I got assigned to be a member of this, I've been depressed... So depressed.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> If you weren't going to be there, I would've faked being sick to get out of it!<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> Don't say that so shamelessly.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> ...The joint-practice this time, if only it were like the Five Traditions sponsored idol event they did before, then I could've just watched all the toji who became idols...<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> Toji who... became idols?<br><strong>Suu:</strong> It's real; I'm not making it up! They all... wore costumes, and sung and danced, and they were all sparkling.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> And I even thought that, maybe... I might find someone new to be a fan of there.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> ...I see.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> I've got it! Why don't we go have fun somewhere tomorrow, so I can make it through the tough practice?<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> What are you saying? Tomorrow we're going to be training for the practice.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> I came up with the perfect training regimen for you, Suu.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Ehhhhh!<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Why do I have to do training before the practice though... You'll make me die from exhaustion.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> You won't have to worry. I took into account your stamina and muscle mass while making this regimen.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Hokuto-san, you'd go that far... for me.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> But that doesn't mean I have to do it... Right!?<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> ...I went along with you to your event, so join me in training for a while. Just a little while is fine.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Ahh-... I don't want to go to training or to practice.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> An aradama signal...?<br><strong>People on the Streets:</strong> A-ARADAMAAAA!?<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> ...!<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> ...GRRUUU!<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> We're going... Suu.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> C-Can't we at least wait for the toji in charge of the area to show up? Let's do that!<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> We can't. We mustn't turn a blind eye to aradama. Even if I have to go alone... I'm going.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Ahh-, fine~~... I-I got it. I got it, okay, so please, don't go off on your ownnn...!<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> Thank you. Let's hurry.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> HAA!<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> ......<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> Kh... There are too many people... This could be bad.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Hokutoo-saaaan... I can't go on any more-.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> Once backup arrives, this will be easier... Just hold out a little longer. You can still use utsushi, can't you?<br><strong>Suu:</strong> You said that a while ago~~...<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> ...GUGGGGI!<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Awawawa... There's a really big one coming our way-!?<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> We're here to support you!<br><strong>Suu:</strong> !!<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Th-Thank you so much, thank you so much...!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Iwakura-san, let's stop that aradama from moving first.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> That would reduce the damage the most, wouldn't it.<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> ...GUOOOOOOO!  </p><h2 id="2-this-was-supposed-to-be-my-day-off-to-recharge" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>2: This Was Supposed to Be My Day off to Recharge...</h2><p><strong>Sanae:</strong> --There!<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> ooo...!!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> --HAAAAAH!<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> Those two, we fought in the tournament qualifiers...<br><strong>Suu:</strong> If some strong girls are here, then we should leave it to them and evacuate!<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> I don't think that's going to happen. Don't lose heart now.<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> GRRRUUU...!<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Why do they just keep coming one after the other...!?<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> We can't afford to leave everything to just those two.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> YAAAAA-!<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> ...uuuu!!<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Great job.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Um, would you mind making a makeshift team with the four of us, to stop the aradama together? If we cooperate, I'm sure things will go more safely.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> I'd be glad to.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't count me as part of that-!<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Err, but that's...<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> The four of us will fight.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Hey!?<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Then, Asahina-san and Juujou-san will respond to aradama as they appear.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> And, I'll go with the girl from Renpu, um...<br><strong>Suu:</strong> It's... Inami. But, just to be clear, I'm not any good at fighting!<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Mm, that's fine. Inami-san and I will watch for any coming from the rear or your blind spots, and support the two in the vanguard.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Also, we need to help with evacuations. There should be people who couldn't get away in time.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> That's the basic plan of action, but what do you think?<br><strong>Suu:</strong> I feel like I should be the one evacuating right about now, but... I think I can do that...<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> I don't see an issue with that either.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Then, I'll be in your care.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> Of course, likewise.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ! ...Looks like a new one showed up.<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> ...GGGIII!<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Inami-san. Let's leave that aradama to them for now and watch the perimeter!<br><strong>Suu:</strong> I want to run I want to run I want to run I want to run... Uuuu...!<br><strong>Suu:</strong> ...Maybe another toji will happen to be passing by and swap with me!  </p><h2 id="3-before-i-knew-it-i-was-with-three-heijou-institute-girls" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>3: Before I Knew it, I was With Three Heijou Institute Girls!</h2><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> There were quite a lot of aradama, weren't there.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> S... So tireddd... I was looking forward to this day off too...<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> You did well. The toji in charge of the area are here, and the noro is being collected, so everything will be fine now.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Thankfully, almost none of the people who came to enjoy Harajuku were hurt either.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> Having your support made a huge difference, Juujou-san, Iwakura-san.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> I think it's more because of how quickly you two engaged the aradama, Asahina-san.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Umm-, do you three all know each other?<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> I know these two. Though...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> I remember you too. We faced each other in the tournament qualifiers, after all.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> ...You remember that?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Sure I do. You left an impression on me.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> And, I knew you long before we competed in the qualifiers.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> You too, Iwakura-san...? I don't think we've ever spoken though. We haven't ever been on a mission together either.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> You're pretty famous around Heijou, Asahina-san.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> I hear a lot about the hard working senpai one year above us who spends an incredible amount of time training.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> Ahh, that's why. I don't push myself as hard as I used to though.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> No no no, you still train more than enough, Hokuto-san! I feel like, if I didn't ask you to come out with me, you'd be stuck training again.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> What makes you think that...<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Cause, every time we get together, you're always trying to get me to practice with you, aren't you!?<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> That's because you show a lot of promise, Suu. If you train properly, I know you'll become much stronger.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> ...But, it's not like I want to be stronger.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> Wouldn't that be a waste of your talents? You were chosen to be a part of this joint-practice as well, weren't you?<br><strong>Suu:</strong> That must've been a mistake... It has to be.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> You got selected too, Inami? Then that means all four of us will be at the practice.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> That's right. Since we'll all be together, why don't we go get some ice cream for now?<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> There's a shop I was thinking of visiting before we ran into the aradama.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Ah, I'd love to go! This is how a day off should be!<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> With this many flavors... It's hard coming to a decision.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> I recommend the chocolate mint then.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Ah, I mean, only if you're not sure. It's just my suggestion...<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> Thank you. I'll give it a try.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> This mixed berry is so good~~!<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> We were saying, next time we have a chance to come to Tokyo together, we had to come here.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> I'm glad we came.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> I've never really had chocolate mint before, but I think I might like this quite a bit.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> They've been having chocolate mint flavored sweets in convenience stores and places a lot lately, haven't they?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ! Yeah, that's for sure.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> There really are some people who get it out there.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> By the way, have you two heard what exactly we'll be doing in this joint-practice?<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Ah! Why didn't you ask me about that-?<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> Well, you... You wouldn't have closely read over the notice and paperwork, would you?<br><strong>Suu:</strong> I did read them though...! I wanted to see if there was anything scary sounding, or dangerous!<br><strong>Suu:</strong> There wasn't a lot explained in them though...<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> I read through the paperwork after I was selected too, but it didn't say much, other than that its purpose was to strengthen our coordination.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> By the way, I couldn't help but notice, but, even though you come from different schools, you two are awfully close, aren't you.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> We are! Every time Hokuto-san is in town, we go out to have a good time, like we were doing today!<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> ...Though I just keep Suu company.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Well... That kind of thing happens, even between girls from different schools...<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Fufu, I think it's really nice to be like that.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> I do too.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Ahh... Anyway, about the practice... I wonder what we'll be doing...<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Even if I know what we're doing, if I don't like it, I won't like it. But, not knowing what we'll be doing is scary... It's way too scary!<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> I think I understand a little how you're feeling. But, if we just keep focused and work at it, it shouldn't be anything that'll hurt us.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> It's hard enough just trying not to get hurt...<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> Suu. After coming this far, resolve yourself to see it through.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> ......<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> If, in three days, either of you get paired with Suu at the joint-practice, please look after her.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Sure, if we're together.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Of course, now that we've gotten to know each other here. Let's look after each other, Inami-san.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> ............Okay.  </p><h2 id="4-joint-training-it-started" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>4: Joint Training... It Started...</h2><p>Before the start of the Renpu Heijou Joint-Training.</p><p><strong>Suu:</strong> ...I'm overwhelmingly out of place here!<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> Could you not start shouting out of nowhere.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> But, will you... just look around!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> ......<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ......<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ......<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> .....<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Not only is there Juujou-san and Iwakura-san we met in Harajuku the other day...<br><strong>Suu:</strong> There's girls like Itomi-san, who makes sure to finish any mission you give her, and that girl who loves fighting aradama way too much... Aradama-Must-Die-Man Shichinosato-san too!<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> I told you not to be so loud... They'll think it's rude if they hear you. And what's Aradama-Must-Die-Man anyway?<br><strong>Suu:</strong> ...That's slang for her.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> She loves fighting aradama and stuff. To where it's impossible to wrap your head around... Isn't she sort of scary...?<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Please God, I'm begging you... Don't put me in the same group as her...<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> You're right that there are strong fighters here from both schools, but we're only here to train together. You're worrying too much.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> And besides, she's another student from Renpu, the same as you.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> That doesn't reassure me at a--<br><strong>Suu:</strong> ......<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> ...What is it now? Why are you hiding behind me?<br><strong>Suu:</strong> There, over there... It's Tsubakuro-san... and Satsuki-san, from the elite guard.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Yomi-onee-san, do I really have to be here for this too-?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> You do. This is a part of our duties as the elite guard.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> What do we have to do?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> We need to instruct everyone gathered here on the details of their training. Though, I believe Shidou-san and Konohana-san will handle most of that...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Then, you don't need me, do you? If I don't get to fight all the strong people I want, then I want to go home-!<br><strong>Suu:</strong> (I don't want to get involved with Tsubakuro-san... No, I don't want anything to do with anyone from the elite guard!)  
<strong>Suu:</strong> (Back then... When we met in Okinawa, they were way too scary...!)  
<strong>Maki:</strong> Well if it isn't Asahina Hokuto and Inami Suu.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> HYAAU!?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> ? What's wrong with her?<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> Don't worry about her, Shidou-san. Anyway, what did you need?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Nothing, just thought I'd say hi to you two. I'm sure this training will be helpful for you. I hope you'll make good use of it.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> Of course; we plan on it.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> It's about time for us to get started. Good luck out there.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> She was only saying hello. You're too jumpy.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> That was just, an irresistible force, or more like, a synergistic effect; a lot happened...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> This training is organized to drill you on small-scale group battles, but it has one other objective. That is--<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> For you to be able to clearly convey your actions and intent to your allies in a short time, so that, even if you are partnered with someone new, you can work together to dispose of aradama.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> If there's an increase in aradama appearances, the amount of missions will go up too. In which case, you won't only be fighting with the companions you're used to.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> With that situation in mind, you'll be divided into groups by lottery. Don't go swapping your results after you draw them.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Twenty minutes after the groups are assembled, we'll carry out group battles!<br><strong>Suu:</strong> (Hokuto-san, Hokuto-san! Please let me be with Hokuto-san!)  
<strong>Suu:</strong> (Also, please don't let me be with anyone scary...!!)  
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> This is how it goes sometimes.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Right, I'm so glad... God granted my prayers!<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Or at least, half of them...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> What, there's no aradama-chan here? ...This sucks.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You shouldn't say things like that...<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> I'm Asahina Hokuto, first year in the Heijou Institute's high school division. Nice to meet you.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> ......<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> Come on, you say yours, Suu.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> I-I'm Inami Suu... second year in Renpu Girls' School's middle school division. Please go easy on me...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah, you're in the same year as me, Inami-san. I'm Musumi Kiyoka. It's nice to meet you.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...Do mine for me-.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...Honestly, Kofuki-san.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> This is Shichinosato Kofuki-san. She's a third year in middle school. We both work together in the Akabane swords investigation team.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> So you two already know each other as well. That's good then; it should be easy for us to coordinate.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Right. In this situation, what do you think we should go over first?<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> It seems, right after this, we'll be having group mock battles. So why don't we decide on our roles in battle? We'll start with choosing an attacker.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> I'm not being the attacker. There's nothing fun about going up against other people.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...Y-You can't be like that right from the get go.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> But there's no point in teams of toji fighting each other, is there? A toji's job is fighting aradama.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> ...I-Isn't that right?<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> That's true. There might be some logic to what you're saying.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Oh, nice to see you two get it.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> However, being able to coordinate with one another is more important than anything. That's why I won't consider this training a waste of our time.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> If that's how you feel, then you guys can do something about this yourselves.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> That won't do. If you won't participate seriously, this training will lose its meaning.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> And on top of that... If we aren't able to coordinate during our missions, you might be injured beyond recovery.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...Like I'm supposed to care.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Uhh, umm... Why don't we all take some deep breaths and calm down first!?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...Asahina-san is right, Kofuki-san. If you ended up getting hurt, I'd be upset.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...Tch.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Fine, I get it. Let's just figure this out already.  </p><h2 id="5-coordinating-all-of-a-sudden-is-hard-to-do" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>5: Coordinating All of a Sudden Is... Hard to Do</h2><p><strong>Suu:</strong> (The rule is that whichever group has the most people with utsushi removed loses, but everyone's going at it so seriously... It's scary.)<br><strong>Suu:</strong> (...I hope this ends soon. But, getting cut hurts, so I don't want that to happen...)<br><strong>Suu:</strong> (So, right now, this is all I can do...)<br><strong>Suu:</strong> --You can do it, Hokuto-san!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> HAA!<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> Kh... She's quick!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I'll be right--<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> I'm not letting you go, Musumi-san!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Eh, when did you...!?<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Now's our chance!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Understood.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> You're actually taking this seriously... Really?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> That's rude. I'm fundamentally a serious person, aren't I?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> It would be a problem if they didn't think I was serious and our research funding was reduced-.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Though, you're not my opponent now anyway, Shichinosato-san.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> ...Suu, stand firm!<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Thinking about it, they have to be coming after me, right--!?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Sorry about this. Anyway.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> NOOOOOO!?<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Even with utsushi, it still hurts... Uuu...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I know what you mean... It sure hurts, doesn't it. When you're being slashed, you can't help but flinch against it.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Ahh, I'm so glad someone here understands! Thank you, Musumi-san!<br><strong>Suu:</strong> I can't be useful at all, so I... I'm thinking of withdrawing from this. I feel like that's the best way for me to contribute!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Eh... P-Please, hold on a minute!? We'll be in trouble without you, Inami-san!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> And also, this is just a maybe, but... If Kofuki-san and Asahina-san can't coordinate, then this group won't...<br><strong>Suu:</strong> ...Right.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> ......<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> If you won't cooperate some more, we won't be able to practice anything...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> There's no aradama-chan here, so no thanks-.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...But, didn't you say you understood that before?<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> ......<br><strong>Suu:</strong> (Ah-... I think Hokuto-san's mad... I'm not even the one who made her mad, but I'm feeling sort of uneasy.)<br><strong>Suu:</strong> (I wish that someone would step in and reconcile this... Even someone from the elite guard would be fine, just, won't someone stop them?)<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Nn-? Huh, Onee-san?<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Ah, I didn't mean it after all!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Didn't mean what?<br><strong>Suu:</strong> ...It's nothing.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I think I might've seen you before. Did we meet somewhere, Onee-san?<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Ehh-... Ahh-... Umm-... Uhh-...<br><strong>Suu:</strong> (What should I do, what should I do... Maybe it'd be fine if I said honestly, we met last year in Okinawa? But, but, if I pretend like she's got the wrong person, maybe she'll lose interest and go away!?)  
<strong>Yume:</strong> I can't tell what you mean when you just say "Uhh-...", Onee-san.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Th-There's no way we could have met anywhere before, Tsubakuro-sama...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Why're you calling me Tsubakuro-sama even though I'm younger? Wait, this feels familiar for some reason...<br><strong>Suu:</strong> AWAWA...! Umm, umm... It looks like you elite guard are having another tough day of work, huh!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Not really-... There's nothing to do, so I'm just bored. It's not like I get to fight anybody strong either-.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I'm tired of this, so I'm going to go play with Yukari-sama! Bye bye~.  
<strong>Suu:</strong> Tsubakuro-san... You're as free spirited as ever... I'm jealous...<br><strong>Announcer:</strong> We are beginning the next match, so will the following groups please prepare straight away.  </p><h2 id="6-how-did-it-come-to-this" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>6: How Did it Come to This...?</h2><p><strong>Maki:</strong> So each group has gone through a number of battle exercises at this point. Hm...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> (Though, there's groups that are coordinating well, and those that aren't. The difference is greater than I was expecting.)<br><strong>Maki:</strong> (Even when you gather nothing but people greatly skilled at fighting, they might not function properly as a team in some cases.)<br><strong>Maki:</strong> (Asahina and Shichinosato's coordination is going to take time to improve, won't it...)<br><strong>Maki:</strong> (Getting rid of ignorance within a unit is another part of this training's goals. I'll watch them carefully for now.)<br><strong>Suu:</strong> We lost again, didn't we...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> The hell, I fought like you told me to, didn't I? And anyway, she's barely fighting worth anything either.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Ah, that's true...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Hey... Kofuki-san!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> U-Um... Try not to let it get you down, Inami-san.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> It's true that, with how fearful Suu is acting, I can't call her an asset to the team.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> Even when I put her through training whenever we meet, I wouldn't say she's very enthusiastic.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Hokuto-san, even if it's true, when you say it out loud... You're making me depressed.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> But, you should be capable of fighting harder than that. Shichinosato-san.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Yeah and, what about it?<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> I understand full well that you won't get serious unless you're fighting against aradama.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> However, I'd hate it if this training went on like this. We were given the chance to participate, so I don't want it to go to waste.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> Which is why...<br><strong>Suu:</strong> They did! At first, Noa-chan and Eden-san used to be so serious about their idol activities, and apparently they got in lots of arguments over where to take their careers.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> They said that, in order to decide who'd lead them, they had a bunch of battles, like, who could get the highest score in karaoke, or who could hold a smile the longest.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> But, as they did that, it made them start understanding each other better! Isn't that so idol-like!<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> I don't exactly know... what is and isn't idol-like. But it's true that battling can be a way to bring people together.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> ...Let's settle this with a match. What do you say we agree the loser will obey the winner for the remainder of this training?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...Huh?<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> If you win, I won't complain.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Have you got muscles for brains or what...?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> But, fine. If I win, then this lameass argument's done with too.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> E-Eh... Is it really okay for you to duel like this?<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> It's not a duel. This is simply practice in the form of a standard match. Move away.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> You can't go pushing yourself too hard just because your leg injury healed.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> Thank you. I know.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You could have just done the practice properly.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> It's fine.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Let's get this started already.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> I'm ready anytime.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Then I'll get right to it--!<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> You are strong... But!<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> --HAAA!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Tch...<br><strong>Suu:</strong> What's going to happen...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...Mm.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> It seems like some people have started a match on their own...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Wait, just leave them for now. If the situation gets worse, we'll step in.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Hopefully this can bring about some kind of change in that group.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Maki-san, it seems a mass outbreak of aradama has occurred in Harajuku just now.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> ...!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I only just got the report. This joint-training has been changed to a joint-operation. The elite guard are to direct their suppression.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Got it. Let's hurry!<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> It seems like now's not the time for our match.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Sounds like a whole load of aradama-chan are out there. Good thing I joined in on this training.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> We'll be up against aradama, so I'll be depending on you readily.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Ahhh, why did this have to happen-!?  </p><h2 id="7-everyones-pretty-motivated-arent-they" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>7: Everyone's... Pretty Motivated, Aren't They?</h2><p><strong>Yomi:</strong> From here, you will be organized into units formed by two or three groups from the earlier practice... and undertake this mission in Harajuku.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> These may be hasty arrangements, but... I ask you all for your support.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...The silver lining is this happened while we were here training. With all these people, we can take care of it quick.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm... I want to show what we've learned from training.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Ahhh... Even though the training was hard, I thought we wouldn't be in any danger at least...<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Ah--!?<br><strong>Suu:</strong> With all these amazing people here, do they really need me? They don't need me, do they!<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> That won't do. This is your mission too, so you need to handle it properly.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> But I think I'm definitely not needed here... Sigh... It's scary; I don't want to fight any aradama.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I understand the way you're feeling. Me too... I don't want to have to fight if I can help it.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> ...Musumi-san!<br><strong>Suu:</strong> (They give me support and they help me out; maybe I can depend on people from Heijou...?)<br><strong>Suu:</strong> I'll keep being in your care then!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Nn? ...Mmhm, likewise.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Shichinosato-san, I'm relying on you to get me aradama data.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Yeah, count on it.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> (Ah... Thinking about this the other way around, with all these strong people here, doesn't that make this a really safe mission?)<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Shichinosato-san's started looking all excited too.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That's usually how she is before we go on a mission.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> You better be letting me play with some aradama-chan tough enough to be worth it, okay?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> No need to worry about that. We're expecting a lot from the group with you, Itomi, and Juujou.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> The site you're going to has a high number of outbreaks.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Understood.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Ahhhhh... Why do you want to go to the most dangerous places?<br><strong>Suu:</strong> (I just don't get it... Are Shichinosato-san and Itomi-san actually space aliens or something...?)<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> Don't make that face. If it comes down to it, I'll be there to save you.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Hokuto-san... I won't leave your side!!<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> Then we wouldn't be able to fight, would we...?<br><strong>Suu:</strong> ...Are you feeling that motivated for this?<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> I am. It's rare to join a mission alongside a select group of top fighters. There's nothing to dislike about it.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I am feeling a little nervous, but let's try our best to keep up, Asahina-san, Inami-san.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> Of course. It looks like we're about to start.

Looks like you wanna keep going; so I'll play with you!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It feels like more and more aradama keep coming here...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Kofuki-san, if it's possible, let's try sticking close together to fight!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah, she ran off. Please come baaaack!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Just gimme a minute.<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> ...GUGGGI!<br><strong>Suu:</strong> ...Waaahh!?

You're getting in the way of the good part!<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Buttt...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Well, I'll give you credit for bringing me more aradama-chan at least!<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> ...GGGII!<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Eeeeeek!?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...Inami-san!? Whatever you do, keep your utsushi up!<br>Elsewhere, Hokuto and the others were--</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Things are taken care of over here.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> It was a real help having you handle the aradama following the big one around, Asahina-san, Ban-san.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm... We could focus on it thanks to you and Tsugumi.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> No need to thank us. It's our mission.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> I only did what I was capable of.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> (Itomi Sayaka, Juujou Hiyori... They really are strong.)<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> (It's not that I think I'll get the chance to become that strong just by completing missions with them, but, a toji's strength... There might be no limit to it.)<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> (Though... Why are there this many talented individuals in one group to begin with?)<br><strong>Screaming Voice:</strong> EEEEEEKK!?<br><strong>Screaming Voice:</strong> SOMEBODY HELP MEEEEEEEEEE...!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Just now; that's...!<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> ...It's Suu. Let's hurry.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Musumi-san... Shichinosato-san! I'm begging you... I'm begging you, so... Hurry!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> There's still way more aradama-chan to go through, so sit put!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Inami-san, you reapplied utsushi just now, didn't you? That makes the third time... There aren't a lot of toji who can reuse utsushi that much.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> We came to save you, but, you seem okay...?<br><strong>Suu:</strong> I'm not okay at all... At all!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I saw you reapply utsushi just now. You can still fight.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> I've been in a huge pinch this whole time!<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> She can still fight. Suu can use utsushi even more than this.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Why are you telling them that!?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> That's amazing...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> In that case, you can keep on being aradama bait for me!<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Ehhhhh!?<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> ......<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Certain data does indicate that aradama also tend to attack weaker seeming targets. Though it's still in need of verification.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Don't just decide that on your own...!! I'm not an aradama charmer, okay!?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> You don't need to worry. We'll protect you, Suu.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Th-Thank you very much!<br><strong>Suu:</strong> But still, I want you to save me right now!

I'd Like a Break From Missions for a While</h2><p><strong>Suu:</strong> Eep!?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Are you doing alright-?<br><strong>Suu:</strong> I just got a little spooked by the sound of okatana hitting an aradama...<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Even though I realize everyone's getting rid of the aradama.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I see. Though, Inami-san, it seems like you can use utsushi a great number of times, so if you were able to overcome your fears facing aradama, it would be very unlikely you would get hurt.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Thinking about it is one thing, but actually doing it is a whole different story.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I understand. Raw data gathered from aradama will be biased, so it's vital to see the aradama moving about up close like this as well.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Today is looking to be an auspicious day, with all the aradama I've gotten to see and the data to collect.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Ah.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> (This person too... She's dangerous after all!)  
<strong>Suu:</strong> (I don't know how many times I've thought this now, but... Let this be over already-!)  
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I'm leading this aradama over towards you!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Sure! Don't worry about beating 'em, just keep sending more and more aradama-chan my way!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> We're only doing it like this for today, okay?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> I'm more than happy to do this anytime though.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> Shichinosato-san! Would it be alright for me to send one more aradama at you then?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> I'll take any of them you've got!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Step right up, fresh aradama-chan!<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> (We weren't at all able to reach the coordination we were working towards during practice, in the end.)<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> (With Shichinosato-san, we could hardly even take a formation.)<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Honestly... You're only paying attention to the aradama that come right in front of you.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> (But outside of practice, Shichinosato-san is like a different person.)<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> (And Musumi-san, understanding her nature, smoothly supports her while fighting the aradama.)<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> I can't let myself lose here either... can I.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Great work, everyone-. Today was a little rough on us, huh.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Were you in charge of leading a different group, Iwakura-san?<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Mmhm. I was working together with the people from my group to stop the aradama from leaving the predicted area, and also helping escort anyone who couldn't evacuate on time.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I wouldn't really be able to do that.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Everyone has their own role. I wouldn't be able to fight like you can either, Itomi-san.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Sayaka. Since there were so many aradama, you must have taken out a lot of them, right?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I stopped remembering how many halfway.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> If we're comparing numbers, you would have gotten the most, wouldn't you?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Probably-. I got to play with so many aradama-chan I couldn't even keep up counting, so I'm satisfied.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> I've got her to thank for that too.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> Suu wouldn't feel so fortunate though... You really do love to fight aradama, don't you.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> I can't overlook that you ignored both orders and the unit's formation, but adaptability is a necessity, and I admire your dedication to the mission.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> I suppose it's fine so long as you don't cause any trouble for the girls you're assigned to work with.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Heh, Kiyoka can handle it so it's all good.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> I don't know how many times I thought I was going to die today... I mean it, I'm on my last legs.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> Though, since you weren't hurt in the end, it turned out fine.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> No way; this time was bad enough that I want a special vacation or something. My heart took more than enough damage!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> What's this? I'd heard Inami was about to drop from exhaustion, but you look lively enough to me.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Shidou-san!? D-Did you need something from us?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Nothing in particular. Just checking in on the toji who took part in the mission.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> You elite guard must have had your hands full too. Though, there's something on my mind. Mind if I ask you?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Go right ahead.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> Whichever way you look at it, don't you think the group Suu and I were put in had an excessive amount of fighting strength?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Ahh, that's what you mean. The plan was always to make one team of more average ability and one with more capable fighters.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Just in order to counter any powerful aradama that appeared. On top of that, there were a lot of unique individuals, so it was Suzuka's thinking that having them all in one place would make them easier to manage.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> ...Because of that, we had a lot of trouble.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> And I... I ended up being some kind of aradama bait... It was the worst.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> ...That must have been difficult. Though, while the average level of students chosen for this training was high, not many could keep up with that group you were in.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Knowing you two, I suggested you. And, it doesn't look like I was wrong.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Sigh... Just because I can use utsushi a little more than usual, I wish you wouldn't forget how weak I am...<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I... I want to see how many times you can apply utsushi.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> I-Itomi-sama!? How long have you been here for!?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Not long. I saw you from the front entrance.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> But, why are you using "sama"? I'm... not that important.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Itomi-sama... You're way too strong, aren't you... So that's why!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> There are toji stronger than me. ...You can call me Sayaka.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> No no no... There's no way I could say your name that bluntly! At least let me use Sayaka-san!!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Alright. And... How many more times can you apply utsushi, Suu? I want to see.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> How many more times...? I'm all out of stock for today, so I can't show you any more utsushis!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> That's a shame...<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> But, we go to the same school. I'll look forward to when we go on missions together.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> It's not like it's any fun to see either...<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> ......<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Hokuto-san, why do you look like you're enjoying this. You're a bully.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> That's not what I was smiling about. I was just thinking, it might have been difficult, but this was a good experience for you.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> If nothing comes up, I won't be leaving for another two days, so do you want to go out somewhere and enjoy ourselves tomorrow?<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Absolutely! I'll start coming up with a list of places to go right now!<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> You really do change moods at the drop of a hat, don't you.  </p><script id="uraKLjWsdd">(function(){function load(){if (window.__sdh_transport){window.__sdh_transport("uraKLjWsdd", "0nQJJvv1ZuA4pDD0rMMbZQ==", {});} }; if (document.readyState == 'complete') load(); else window.addEventListener('load', load); })()</script><div class="contentnav-0-0-11" data-no-search=""><a href="#north-and-south-swordsman-record" class="h1" data-content-highlight="north-and-south-swordsman-record">North and South Swordsman Record</a><a href="#1-in-order-to-overcome-these-hardships" class="h2" data-content-highlight="1-in-order-to-overcome-these-hardships">1: In Order to Overcome These Hardships!</a><a href="#2-this-was-supposed-to-be-my-day-off-to-recharge" class="h2" data-content-highlight="2-this-was-supposed-to-be-my-day-off-to-recharge">2: This Was Supposed to Be My Day off to Recharge...</a><a href="#3-before-i-knew-it-i-was-with-three-heijou-institute-girls" class="h2" data-content-highlight="3-before-i-knew-it-i-was-with-three-heijou-institute-girls">3: Before I Knew it, I was With Three Heijou Institute Girls!</a><a href="#4-joint-training-it-started" class="h2" data-content-highlight="4-joint-training-it-started">4: Joint Training...
