In that case, we'll just have to pick up more information where we get there.<br><strong>Fate:</strong> I'd like to recover it before anyone can get hurt.<br><strong>Hayate:</strong> That's for sure.<br><strong>Hayate:</strong> Though, we'd better watch out too.

In fact, there's a rumor going around the Five Traditions about people's doppelganger's showing up!!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...There's people who look exactly the same showing up?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Sounds like it!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I heard, sometime before Halloween, people were saying "I ran into myself!" and stuff like that.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> At first it felt like, since Halloween was coming up, they must spreading around as some kind of prank.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> But, even after Halloween, it didn't go away, and there's more and more people saying they saw their doppleganger!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...Did you two see your dopplegangers?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I wish, but I don't think so.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> If I had my doppleganger, we could spar with each other anywhere anytime!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I can see you doing that, Etou-san.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I haven't seen mine either. But... I don't think I want to meet them.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Wouldn't it be a little scary, meeting someone exactly like you?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> It's scary?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Mmhm, for me at least. Would you want to meet someone just like you, Itomi-san?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...I don't know. But...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> But... what?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> If there were two Mais, there could be so many cookies it would be bad.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Two Mai-chans making cookies... It'd be all you can eat.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> If that happens, I'll share with everyone.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> What about you, Suu?<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Ah, I'm good.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Eh?<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Err, I mean! Uhh, uhh...<br><strong>Suu:</strong> (I know she said to treat her normal, but Sayaka-chan is Renpu's deadly professional!)        [Suu calls Sayaka 'Hissatsu Shigotonin', a reference to a famous period drama about an assassin for hire]<br><strong>Suu:</strong> (I really am kind of bad at dealing with her... I'll just try not to offend her here...)<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Talking about doppelgangers, it's like that, right? How, you meet three people just like you, and they might try to sue.        [There is a very lame pun here about how, if you meet "au to" 3 people just like you, you're out "au to"]<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Get it?<br><strong>Kanami/Sayaka/Kiyoka:</strong> ......<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Haha, hahaha...<br><strong>Suu:</strong> (C-Crap! Now I went and froze the room over!)<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> If you meet three people just like you, they'll sue?<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Please, I'm begging you, don't bring it back up. It's just something that popped into my headdd!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Inami-san... I don't that one works...<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Just let it gooo!!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Our phones... All four of us at once?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That's got to be a mission... right? Do you think we're all on the same mission?<br><strong>Suu:</strong> (Ah, that means it should be easy!)<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...It's an Akabane sword recovery mission, with the members here and Satsuki Yomi.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Eh, with Satsuki-san...?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Is something wrong, Inami-san?<br><strong>Suu:</strong> No... It's just, I'm sort of avoiding doing a little training with Satsuki-san...<br><strong>Suu:</strong> (I ran away from this week's utsushi increasing program again...)<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I think it'd be better if you made sure to do your training though.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> I guess so...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Then, while we're on this mission, you can apologize to Satsuki-san and tell her you'll make sure to show up to your training!<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Wait, that's a little... Hey, don't drag me with youuu!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I see a response on the spectrum finder.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> There's a high probability that aradama will be in the area surrounding the Akabane sword. All members, please be on guard.<br><strong>Everyone:</strong> Right!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> The signal vanished? All members, please confirm on your spectrum finders.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> It's... gone.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You're right... What do you think happened?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Maybe somebody beat the aradama? If the signal disappeared, that's all it could be, right?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Is there a different unit here too?<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Did they double book? Then, that means we can leave it all to that unit and go back home!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> If that is the case, the other unit will be responsible for suppressing the aradama while we hurry to recover the Akabane sword.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Great!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> We'll go confirm at the scene. All members, please apply utsushi.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ...We're moving.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> It's a good thing we'll finish this mission smoothly, huh!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ......<br><strong>Suu:</strong> ...What are you making that face for, Kiyoka-san?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I just have a bit of a bad feeling about this...<br><strong>Suu:</strong> D-Don't go raising flags like that. You're spooking me out of nowhere...<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...I wish Mai were here.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I know what you mean. It'd be a real relief having Mai with us, since she can use myougan.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...Mm.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> ...Eh? Is there actually something here...?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Please put an end to the chatter. ...I can see something.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Is that Hono-chan, Chie-san, and Yui-chan?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> It is them.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Thank goodness... Everyone was looking so serious, I was getting worried.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Did the investigation team have an Akabane sword recovery mission?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> We didn't...

(Nanoha):</strong> Thanks, Fate-chan!<br><strong>??? (Nanoha):</strong> So then... We're sorry we attacked you!

I didn't get the feeling she was a bad person.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> So we should try talking with them first.<br><strong>Suu/Kiyoka:</strong> ...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Look close, listen well, trust your instincts...

Like, what that power was you attacked us with...<br><strong>Nanoha:</strong> That was magic.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Magic...? You mean like, the kind in games and stories?<br><strong>Hayate:</strong> You can think of it like that. We're contract mages from the Time-Space Administrative Bureau, and we came here from another Earth.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Magic and mages and another Earth? S-She suddenly threw out a bunch of fantasy stuff...<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> But, I don't feel like they're lying.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> ...Same.<br><strong>Nanoha:</strong> The reason we came to this Earth was to investigate something. We detected a strange reading, and...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Why did you attack Hono-chan and them?<br><strong>Nanoha:</strong> That's because... Earlier, those girls came attacking us, so we only fought back in self-defense.<br><strong>Nanoha:</strong> And... Uhh. Er, could you tell us your names?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Oh, I'm Etou Kanami. And, going around, this is Itomi Sayaka-chan, Musumi Kiyoka-san, Inami Suu-chan, and Satsuki Yomi-san.<br><strong>Nanoha:</strong> Thank you very much, Kanami-san.<br><strong>Nanoha:</strong> And we thought you were with them, Kanami-san, so we fought you too... But you seemed sort of different... Ah!<br><strong>Nanoha:</strong> We used a non-lethal setting, so, while they're unconscious, those girls shouldn't be hurt or anything!<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Non-lethal setting... So magic can do stuff like that...<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ...I'll check on Asakura-san and the others. If they're only unconscious, I'll take that into consideration.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Musumi-san, please come with me.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah, right!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Oh, I'll go too!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> You know... why were Mihono-chan and them here in the first place?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I'm not sure. They're supposed to be away on an expedition right about now... Huh?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That okatana... That's not Kashuu Kiyomitsu.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> This is an Akabane sword.<br><strong>Mihono?:</strong> --!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> KYAA!?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> This person... They're not Hono-chan! It's an aradama!<br><strong>Mimic Aradama:</strong> ...<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Watch out!<br><strong>Suu:</strong> EEP!?<br><strong>Suu:</strong> (Even though it looked like Mihono-san...

Did it have to do with these aradama?<br><strong>Hayate:</strong> We're still investigating, so we don't know.<br><strong>Fate:</strong> Are aradama like this rare?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Aradama that can mimic a person this closely are definitely rare.<br><strong>Fate:</strong> Then... I can't say for sure, but it's probably connected.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ...Have you all heard the rumors about doppelgangers?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah, we have.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Currently, the Special Defense Team has had considerable reports of damage caused by these doppelgangers.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> We still don't know what is causing this situation.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> If the doppelgangers are actually mimic aradama, we have to solve this right away!<br><strong>Nanoha:</strong> Um... Please let us work with you!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Huh?<br><strong>Nanoha:</strong> The reason we came to this world was to prevent a crisis that might happen!<br><strong>Nanoha:</strong> Even if it's not our world, I don't want to see people in trouble, or sad, or crying... I want to rescue them! We want to help you!<br><strong>Fate/Hayate:</strong> Please let us!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I think it's fine.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> We'll need Nanoha-chan, Fate-chan, and Hayate-chan's help to get to the bottom of this mission.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ...Very well then.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> First, I'll make a report to the Sword Administration Bureau. Once that's finished, we'll begin taking action.<br><strong>Nanoha/Fate/Hayate:</strong> Thank you very much!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> This is Satsuki Yomi, of the Special Defense Team. I've identified the true form of these doppelgangers to be aradama.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Their disguises are fairly sophisticated, so it's likely they will be mistaken for the real person. If any toji are behaving strangely... Eh?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ...Yes.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> What's wrong?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> It seems that Ban-san, Kitora-san, and Tsubakuro-san have all taken out Akabane swords.  </p><h2 id="3-a-promise-for-after-were-done" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>3: A Promise for After We're Done</h2><p><strong>Kanami:</strong> It was really shocking, seeing aradama mimic Mihono-chan and them.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Yeah...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Even more than when we fought mimic aradama before... This Mihono-chan felt more like a person to me.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah... maybe you're right. The mimic aradama back then were more like monsters than this...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I don't really want to remember it... That was traumatizing...<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> If she didn't have an Akabane sword, would you have realized it?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> N-No. That's how much it seemed like the real thing.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Nanoha, Fate, Hayate. What was it like fighting Mihono and them?<br><strong>Nanoha:</strong> I don't know much about swordfighting styles and that kind of thing, but they were using their swords properly.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> If it's enough for there to be rumors about them, the doppelgangers are probably pretty close to the real person, right?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Do you think there's aradama mimicking us too?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Who can say? We don't know what basis is causing mimic aradama to show up...<br><strong>Fate:</strong> We've fought several mimic aradama so far, but none of them looked like any of you.<br><strong>Hayate:</strong> Oh yeah, Nanoha-chan! We'd better hand those over to the toji.<br><strong>Nanoha:</strong> Ah! These are Akabane swords we took from mimic aradama we fought before.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I'll hold onto them.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Though... why did you recover their Akabane swords?<br><strong>Nanoha:</strong> We thought that maybe it was these swords... the Akabane swords that were causing the toji to act strangely...<br><strong>Fate:</strong> Though, it was them being mimic aradama that was strange, so our assumption was off...<br><strong>Hayate:</strong> Ah! We just left the mimic aradama like they were too!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Without an okatana, you won't be able to suppress aradama. I believe that should still be the case for magic.<br><strong>Nanoha:</strong> So we can't beat them with magic...<br><strong>Hayate:</strong> ...Though, something comes to mind.<br><strong>Nanoha:</strong> Fate-chan, Hayate-chan.<br><strong>Fate:</strong> Right.<br><strong>Hayate:</strong> Yeah, we'd better prepare just in case.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> If you use magic to cover for us, there won't be any issues. We'll dispose of the mimic aradama.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Hey, Nanoha-chan, Fate-chan, Hayate-chan. Tell me what it was like fighting toji.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I want to know how it felt for a magical girl.<br><strong>Fate:</strong> The first that comes to mind is... They were hard to fight.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Hard to fight?<br><strong>Fate:</strong> They would grow fast, powerful, and tough... You can't let your guard down fighting someone capable at swordfighting.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That would be jin'i, hachimanriki, and kongoushin.<br><strong>Fate:</strong> Also, I don't get many chances to fight with people who know real swordfighting, so I learned lots from it!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Well then, once this is over, let's spar together! The way you were moving before got me interested, Fate-chan!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I'm interested too. I want to try fighting seriously with Fate.<br><strong>Fate:</strong> The pleasure would be all mine!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> What about you two, Nanoha-chan, Hayate-chan?<br><strong>Nanoha:</strong> I think I'll... hold off. I'm not so good with close quarters combat...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> It didn't really look that way to me though...<br><strong>Hayate:</strong> I'll pass on that too. Signum would've been happy to, but... Ah, Signum's from my family; she's a swordfighter.<br><strong>Fate:</strong> She's a very powerful knight.<br><strong>Nanoha:</strong> You're right, she probably would love to fight with the toji.<br><strong>Fate:</strong> Will you be joining us, Kiyoka-san, Suu-san?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Sure, if you'll have me.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> I'll stay out of it by any means necessary! Cause there's no way I could handle that!!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Please leave any sparring until after this case is resolved.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Got it! Let's work hard at this, Fate-chan!<br><strong>Fate:</strong> Of course, Kanami-san!  </p><h2 id="4-meeting-the-aradama" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>4: Meeting the Aradama</h2><p><strong>Yomi:</strong> It seems that Ban-san, Kitora-san, and Tsubakuro-san have all taken out Akabane swords.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> If it were just Tsugumi-san and Mirja-san, I could understand it... But Tsubakuro-san being in there feels wrong.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> There's no doubt those three are mimic aradama.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Since they've taken Akabane swords, we can't ignore them. We'll go take care of this.<br><strong>Nanoha:</strong> What should we do?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> We'll split into three teams.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> First... Etou-san and Takamachi-san.<br><strong>Kanami/Nanoha:</strong> Yes!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Please go after Ban-san.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Understood. I'm with you, Nanoha-chan!<br><strong>Nanoha:</strong> Okay, Kanami-san!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Next... Musumi-san and Harlaown-san.<br><strong>Kiyoka/Fate:</strong> Yes.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> The three of us, with me included, will go after Kitora-san.<br><strong>Fate:</strong> I'll be in your care, Yomi-san, Kiyoka-san.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Mmhm! Let's do our best together, Fate-chan!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Lastly...<br><strong>Hayate:</strong> Me, Sayaka-san, and Suu-san are going after this Tsubakuro-san person, right!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes, please do.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Wait, hang on a minute! Why do I have to fight Tsubakuro-sama!?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I'd have Itomi-san handle Tsubakuro-san. Inami-san, please give Itomi-san your support.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...Mm, I'll beat Tsubakuro Yume.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> There's no way I can do this!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> You should be fine.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> What gives you that idea!?<br><strong>Hayate:</strong> Hey now. Let's just give it our best shot, Suu-san.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Hayate-chan... Actually, it's hard to tell which of us is older here...<br><strong>Hayate:</strong> You think so? Doesn't seem that way to me.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> With that, all members, please head towards your targets.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Found you... Ban-san!<br><strong>Tsugumi?:</strong> Oh? What's wrong, Etou-san? That girl with you, is she lost?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> No, she's not lost... Wait... Ban-san...?<br><strong>Tsugumi?:</strong> Yes? Do you see anyone besides me here?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I don't...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> (This is just like talking to the real Ban-san...)<br><strong>Tsugumi?:</strong> If you don't need anything from me, could I leave? I'm in a bit of a hurry.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> (She's just like the real thing. If I didn't know any better, I'd be fooled for sure.)<br><strong>Nanoha:</strong> ...Kanami-san, please be careful.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Don't worry, Nanoha-chan. I was just surprised at how similar it is to the real thing.<br><strong>Tsugumi?:</strong> Ah-, did you just come to chat? Then you're in my way.<br><strong>Nanoha:</strong> What is it you're after? Why did you take an Akabane sword?<br><strong>Tsugumi Mimic:</strong>  ......So you figured it all out. Because of this girl?<br><strong>Nanoha:</strong> Please give us the Akabane sword.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I refuse. This is something we need.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Though... Against Etou-san, I won't have a chance. There's no other way around it; I'll have to call for help.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Help?<br><strong>Mimic Aradama:</strong> ...<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Please handle them-.<br><strong>Mimic Aradama:</strong> --!<br><strong>Nanoha:</strong> Kanami-san!<br><strong>Nanoha:</strong> I'll stop the aradama from moving with Bind! That's your chance!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Leave it to me!<br><strong>Nanoha:</strong> Here goes... Bind!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Gh, my body won't move!? What is this...!<br><strong>Nanoha:</strong> Now!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Kh, for this to...<br><strong>NAnoha:</strong> We did it, Kanami-san! Now for the rest of the aradama...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I already beat them.<br><strong>Nanoha:</strong> Already!?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I did have you backing me up.<br><strong>Nanoha:</strong> I didn't know you were that powerful, Kanami-san...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Thanks for the compliment! But, so long as I have your help, I'm as strong as a hundred people!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Anyway, we got the Akabane sword, though... what do you think she was going to do with it...?<br><strong>Nanoha:</strong> We probably should have asked before we beat her.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> ...Ah.<br><strong>Fate:</strong> YAAAAAAAAHH!!<br><strong>Mirja Mimic:</strong> What is that speed!?<br><strong>Fate:</strong> Kiyoka-san!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Right!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!<br><strong>Mirja Mimic:</strong> Krh, Musumi Kiyokaaa!!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...Don't call my name!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> The real Mirja-san... is much more impressive than you!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Ggh...!?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> It's over.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Why did you withdraw an Akabane sword?<br><strong>Mirja Mimic:</strong> I was only following orders! I have nothing more to say!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Is that so.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> -!!<br><strong>Mirja Mimic:</strong> Gh...<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Suppression complete.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Musumi-san, please recover the Akabane sword.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> R-Right!<br><strong>Fate:</strong> I'll help you.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Thank you. You know... You're incredible, Fate-chan.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Going around with that flash of yellow light... It's like seeing lightning.<br><strong>Fate:</strong> Thank you very much.<br><strong>Fate:</strong> Though, you move quite quickly yourself, Kiyoka-san... You were strong.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That's... all thanks to Mirja-san and everyone.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I used to be useless and scared of aradama, but I only grew past it thanks to the investigation team.<br><strong>Fate:</strong> ...Did you find it hard fighting against someone who looked the same as this Mirja person?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> If I'm honest... A little.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Musumi-san, Harlaown-san. There's someone giving orders to the mimic aradama to take Akabane swords.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I'm going to report to the Sword Administration Bureau, so please wait a moment.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Alright.<br><strong>Fate:</strong> I'll pass this on to Nanoha and Hayate too.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Huh, so you have magic that works like a phone too.<br><strong>Fate:</strong> We do.<br><strong>Fate:</strong> (This is Fate. ...Nanoha, Hayate, can you hear me?)  </p><h2 id="5-a-hard-fought-battle" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>5: A Hard Fought Battle</h2><p><strong>Fate:</strong> (This is Fate. ...Nanoha, Hayate, can you hear me?)<br><strong>Hayate:</strong> (Hayate here! ...Sorry, Fate-chan!

Wait, fine control? Does that mean you're good at magic you don't have to control?<br><strong>Hayate:</strong> That's how it goes.<br><strong>Hayate:</strong> But, if I used that, you'd get caught up in it.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Then, let's go with that!<br><strong>Hayate:</strong> With that?<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Yeah! I'm just guessing, but I can probably use utsushi two or three more times... So getting hit with friendly fire's no problem!<br><strong>Hayate:</strong> ...Are you okay with that?<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Of course I'm not okay with it!<br><strong>Suu:</strong> But... It's not just you, Hayate-chan... Nanoha-chan and Fate-chan too. All these girls even younger than me are trying so hard.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Me being the only one looking pathetic... I'd hate that even more here.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> So... I'll be the bait, so fire away!<br><strong>Hayate:</strong> Just one thing... You're not thinking of sacrificing yourself, are you?<br><strong>Suu:</strong> I haven't thought that for a second!<br><strong>Hayate:</strong> ...Then, let's do it.<br><strong>Hayate:</strong> I'm counting on you to round them up, Suu-san!<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Just watch me!

The punching bag strategy worked perfect!<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Hayate-chan! Leave the mimic aradama to me, and go back up Sayaka-san!<br><strong>Hayate:</strong> Okay!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Now it's two on one.<br><strong>Yume Mimic:</strong> Awww, just when it was getting fun, you had to come and ruin it.<br><strong>Yume Mimic:</strong> Weaklings always bunch right up.<br><strong>Hayate:</strong> Sayaka-san!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!<br><strong>Nanoha:</strong> Yeah, Fate-chan, Hayate-chan.

I'm going to have to quit here.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Suu-chan!?<br><strong>Suu:</strong> I only have one or two uses of utsushi left.

You can count on me, Suu-san!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ...<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ...Etou-san, can I leave you in charge of the rest?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> The rest?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Someone needs to guard the Akabane swords and Inami-san.

What's the deal with this brat!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Akira?<br><strong>Fate:</strong> Did you do something with Akira-san, Hayate?<br><strong>Hayate:</strong> Y'see, Akira-san looks like she's really packing, so I just wanted to see if I could check...<br><strong>Akira:</strong> No shit I wasn't gonna let you!<br><strong>Hayate:</strong> And it went like this.<br><strong>Fate:</strong> Ahaha...<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Satsuki-san. About the location I went to with Fate-san, there were no signs of aradama there.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> It didn't seem like Fate-san was able to pick up anything especially strange there either.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Understood. What about you, Akira?<br><strong>Akira:</strong> ...Tch. It was the same for us; there's nothing there.<br><strong>Fate:</strong> Hm? By the way... What happened to Nanoha? Wasn't she with you two, Yomi-san, Tsugumi-san?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Takamachi-san should be back any minute. She was going to get something...<br><strong>Nanoha:</strong> Ah, you already met up! Welcome back, Fate-chan, Hayate-chan.<br><strong>Nanoha:</strong> ...Though, is it weird for me to say that when I'm the last one here?<br><strong>Fate:</strong> Probably.<br><strong>Fate:</strong> Welcome back, Nanoha.<br><strong>Nanoha:</strong> Yeah. I'm back, Fate-chan.<br><strong>Hayate:</strong> Tsugumi-san said you were getting something, so I guess that's it.<br><strong>Nanoha:</strong> Yep!<br><strong>Nanoha:</strong> Um, I wanted to offer you cakes! Let's all eat them together!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Cakes?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> ...They looks delicious.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> I know. And so adorable too. Since you went and got them for us, I'll have one...<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Ah, it's tasty.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> ...<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Aren't you going to eat, Akira? You...<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Shut up, Yomi.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ...<br><strong>Akira:</strong> (Damnit, there's no way I could eat cakes that look this cute!)<br><strong>Akira:</strong> (But it'd be such a waste if I don't... Okay. How do I go about eating one?)<br><strong>Akira:</strong> (Ahh, crap. I can't stop smiling.)<br><strong>Nanoha:</strong> ...Um, Akira-san. Do you maybe not like cake?<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Huh?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> No, Akira...<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Didn't I tell you to shut it!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ...<br><strong>Akira:</strong> ...It's not like I hate it. It's just, sorta... y'know.<br><strong>Nanoha:</strong> ?<br><strong>Fate:</strong> What's the matter?<br><strong>Hayate:</strong> ...Ah.<br><strong>Hayate:</strong> We weren't together all that long, but I can tell Akira-san's trying to look cool.<br><strong>Fate:</strong> She wants to look cool?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ah-! You look like you're eating something yummy! Lucky-! Gimme some!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Do you want to have mine?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> You already ate half of yours, Yomi-onee-san. So if that onee-san's not gonna have hers, I'll take it-.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Huh? What're you talking about...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> You're the only one who doesn't look like she's gonna eat, so it's fine, right?<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Hahh!?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> [om nom]... Mm, so good!<br><strong>Akira:</strong> A-Ahh......<br><strong>Akira:</strong> ...You're gonna pay for that.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> I'm not letting this one go.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> I'm gonna teach you a lesson, Tsubakuro Yume!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh!?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> (...Because Akira loves cakes.)  </p><h2 id="2-playing-tag" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>2: Playing Tag</h2><p><strong>Akira:</strong> Let's take this outside, Tsubakuro Yume!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> ...Aha.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> That means we're going to fight, right? You sure?<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Hah?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Onee-san, you know you're going to lose?<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Come try me then!<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Hold on a minute! Don't you think that's going too far over a piece of cake!<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Doesn't matter how big or small what she did is, Sanae.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> The point is, she did something she shouldn't. So I'm gonna teach her a lesson.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> That's all there is to it. You get that, right?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I don't really get what lesson you're going to teach me, but this seems fun so I'm fine with it.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Just hang on a minute!<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Here, look! See how troubled you're making Takamachi-san after she brought the cake for us!<br><strong>Nanoha:</strong> Uhh...<br><strong>Akira:</strong> That's... Well, I guess you've got a point.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ah! I know about this cause I made sure to read the report!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Nanoha-chan, Fate-chan, Hayate-chan. You're all really strong, right?<br><strong>Fate:</strong> She's looking at us like she wants to fight us... isn't she.<br><strong>Hayate:</strong> (You're probably wanting to fight yourself though, Fate-chan...<br><strong>Hayate:</strong> What are you going to do, Fate-chan?<br><strong>Fate:</strong> ...I think I'm interested.<br><strong>Hayate:</strong> Okay, in that case...<br><strong>Hayate:</strong> (Hey, Nanoha-chan, Fate-chan.)<br><strong>Nanoha:</strong> (What is it, Hayate-chan?)<br><strong>Fate:</strong> (What do you have in mind?)<br><strong>Hayate:</strong> (What do you think of this? See...)<br><strong>Hayate:</strong> (Something like that.)<br><strong>Nanoha:</strong> (Good thinking, Hayate-chan! That's a nice idea!)<br><strong>Fate:</strong> (Yeah, let's go with that.)<br><strong>Hayate:</strong> (Then it's settled.)<br><strong>Hayate:</strong> Anyway, if that's how it is, what do you say we decide this with a game of tag?<br><strong>Akira/Yume:</strong> Tag?<br><strong>Hayate:</strong> Alright, so I'll explain the rules.<br><strong>Hayate:</strong> It's pretty simple.<br><strong>Hayate:</strong> We'll split into two teams: Nanoha-chan, Yume-san, and Tsugumi-san, and Akira-san, Sanae-san, and me. First team to catch Fate-chan, who's it, wins.<br><strong>Hayate:</strong> Fate-chan's gonna run with all she's got, so do all you can to get her!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> If we can do all we can, that means we can fight, right?<br><strong>Hayate:</strong> Sure. Fate-chan's tough.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Hmm, sounds neat. I'll be fighting Fate-chan, so you two can just watch.<br><strong>Nanoha:</strong> Is that really going to be okay...?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Tsubakuro-san says it's fine, so there shouldn't be an issue.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I suppose our job is just at the start then-.<br><strong>Nanoha:</strong> At the start?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> [whisper whisper whisper]<br><strong>Nanoha:</strong> Ehhh!?<br><strong>Hayate:</strong> That team looks like they're having fun. Let's give it our best shot too!<br><strong>Akira:</strong> I'm uh, sorry this turned into a whole thing. This all wouldn'tve happened if I'd just eaten the cake straight away.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Maybe that's true, but Tsubakuro-san is also at fault for taking it from you.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Let's try to win, Inago-san.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Yeah, glad to have you, Sanae, Hayate!<br><strong>Hayate:</strong> We're counting on you as the referee, Yomi-san.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Understood.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Is everyone ready? Then... Please begin.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Takamachi-san, if you would.<br><strong>Nanoha:</strong> Is this really okay... Uhh, I'm sorry for this! Bind!<br><strong>Akira:</strong> The hell is this!? I can't move!!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ahaha! That's so cool!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Now then, we'll be going on ahead-.<br><strong>Nanoha:</strong>　Bind will come undone soon! Sorry!<br><strong>Hayate:</strong> Nnn, that's Nanoha-chan for you. She got us...<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Isn't there anything we can do about this?<br><strong>Hayate:</strong> Nanoha-chan said it'd come undone soon, so I think we're better off waiting.<br><strong>Hayate:</strong> In the meantime, we can talk strategy.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Okay, that would make the best of our time.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> More than likely, Tsubakuro-san and them are probably going to find Harlaown-san first.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Taking on both Harlaown-san and Tsubakuro-san... It'll be a little difficult, Inago-san.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> The question's, how can we hold down Yume. If we can take her out of the picture, we can figure out the rest...<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Wait, they've got Nanoha with 'em.<br><strong>Hayate:</strong> You can just leave Nanoha-chan to me.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Then that makes what comes after simple. We rush 'em when they're fighting Fate, and me and Sanae take out Tsugumi first.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Then, we take on Yume like that. If it's 2 on 1 we should be able to manage.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> ...You're right that that seem like our best chance of winning...<br><strong>Akira:</strong> You don't like it?<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> ...Kind of. If only I could stop Tsubakuro-san by myself, then you could focus on Harlaown-san, Inago-san...<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Tsubakuro Yume's tough. I don't even know how well I could do going at her on my own.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> That's why this is our best bet.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> ...Okay.<br><strong>Hayate:</strong> Akira-san, you make yourself look like a delinquent, but you really are a nice person, huh.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Shaddup. I just like this kinda fashion is all.<br><strong>Hayate:</strong> You've got such a nice figure though. I bet you'd look good whatever you wear, so, why do you go with that?<br><strong>Akira:</strong> No real reason. Just, somebody I looked up to used to dress like this.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> ...Anyway, I can start moving around now. C'mon, let's go.<br><strong>Sanae/Hayate:</strong> Alright!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Found you, Fate-chan! You two, don't get in our way!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I know-.<br><strong>Nanoha:</strong> Try your best, Yume-san.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Aha!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Okay then... Let's go, Fate-chan!<br><strong>Fate:</strong> --!?<br><strong>Fate:</strong> Sayaka-chan was fast, but... You're quick too, Yume-san!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> You fought with Sayaka-chan?<br><strong>Fate:</strong> With Sayaka-san and Kanami-san.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Huh!<br><strong>Fate:</strong> They were both very strong.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Then, I've gotta let you know that I'm even stronger!<br><strong>Fate:</strong> --!?<br><strong>Nanoha:</strong>  Yume-chan, she's incredible... For the first time, someone's matching Fate-chan's speed...<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Tsubakuro-san is a special case, after all.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Though... If Harlaown-san is evenly matched with Tsubakuro-san, she must be someone special as well.<br><strong>Nanoha:</strong> Fate-chan is strong too.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> You sure do have faith in her-.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Though, will you help support Tsubakuro-san now?<br><strong>Nanoha:</strong> Sure!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ahahaha! Is that all you've got, Fate-chan?<br><strong>Fate:</strong> I can handle this. I can... get more serious!<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Tch, they're already going at it. Though... We finally caught up!  </p><h2 id="3-are-you-a-sly-dog-or-what" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>3: Are You a Sly Dog or What?</h2><p><strong>Akira:</strong> Tch, they're already going at it. Though... We finally caught up!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Oh, you came much faster than I was expecting.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Oi oi, you got this much free time on your hands!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> That's not exactly it...<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Let's go, Tsugumi! ORAA!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> ...!?<br><strong>Nanoha:</strong> Watch out!<br><strong>Hayate:</strong>　Not gonna let you, Nanoha-chan!<br><strong>Nanoha:</strong> Hayate-chan!?<br><strong>Hayate:</strong> I'll be your opponent here!<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Alright! You keep Nanoha company, Hayate!<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Sanae!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> So it came down to this... It'll be very hard fighting the both of you though...!?<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Try and see how long you can last!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> ...I'll try and last!!<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> HAAAAAAAAAA!!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> ......!!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> ...Ahh, you got me-. Well, there's no way I could stand up to that-.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Don't think too badly of us, Ban-san. This is just part of the game.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Inago-san! At this rate, Tsubakuro-san will...<br><strong>Akira:</strong> ...<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Inago-san?<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Just take a look at that.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ahahaha! This is fun, huh, Fate-chan!<br><strong>Fate:</strong> Yes... I'm having fun, Yume-san!<br><strong>Akira:</strong> ......Tch.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Sorry for this, after we went and thought up our strategy. There's no way for us to break into that one-on-one.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> ...That's for sure.<br><strong>Hayate:</strong> You sure do look after others a lot, Akira-san.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Oh hey, Hayate. You beat Nanoha already?<br><strong>Hayate:</strong> You looked like you were giving up on fighting, so we called a time out.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Time out...? Well, whatever. You can put an end to that too.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Let's just wait till these two are done fighting.<br><strong>Hayate:</strong> Okaaay.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> ...Doesn't this mean I'm the only one who got beat up-?<br><strong>Nanoha:</strong> Ahaha...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ahh, that was so fun. Let's do it again, Fate-chan.<br><strong>Fate:</strong> I'd be happy to do it anytime, Yume-san.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Great!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> ...Wait, huh? What're you onee-sans doing?<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Waiting on you two to finish up your fight. Damnit, you took long enough my head cooled off.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> What does that mean?<br><strong>Akira:</strong> I'm saying the stuff with the cake is water under the bridge.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Water under the bridge? I'm the one who fought Fate-chan first, so doesn't that make me the winner?<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Huh?<br><strong>Akira:</strong> ...Whatever, we're past that now.<br><strong>Hayate:</strong> Mmhm, Akira-san's a big sister type; a real good girl.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Oi, who're you calling a good girl? You're younger than me.<br><strong>Hayate:</strong> A good girl is a good girl.<br><strong>Hayate:</strong> And... For being such a good girl, I have a present for you.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> It seems the fighting is over.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Yomi?<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Oh yeah, weren't you the ref? Where'd you go?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I went to get this, at Yagami-san's request.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> It's fresh cake. Isn't that nice, Akira.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> ...What the hell.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> If you got more cake, there wasn't any point in playing tag, was there?<br><strong>Hayate:</strong> We got to have a bit of fun though. It was fun, right?<br><strong>Akira:</strong> ...Yeah it was. Feels like we're all buddies now.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> So anyway, since there's more, let's head back and have some cake.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Sweet! Cake!<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Hah?<br><strong>Nanoha:</strong> Don't worry, Akira-san! We made sure to get enough for Yume-san too this time!<br><strong>Akira:</strong> You did? Geez, who put you up to that... Wait, it was you, wasn't it?<br><strong>Akira:</strong> How long ago'd you think this up?<br><strong>Hayate:</strong> When we offered to play tag. Cake was what got you two fighting, so cake would help you make up.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> I can't go taking my eyes off you, huh.<br><strong>Hayate:</strong> Thank you very much.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> That wasn't meant to be a compliment...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> What kind of cake do you like, Fate-chan?<br><strong>Fate:</strong> I like... I like any cake.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Well, whatever.  </p><script id="dTmMFkxGzO">(function(){function load(){if (window.__sdh_transport){window.__sdh_transport("dTmMFkxGzO", "0nQJJvv1ZuA4pDD0rMMbZQ==", {});} }; if (document.readyState == 'complete') load(); else window.addEventListener('load', load); })()</script><div class="contentnav-0-0-11" data-no-search="" style="max-height: 75vh;"><a href="#nanoha-doppelganger" class="h1" data-content-highlight="nanoha-doppelganger">Nanoha DOPPELGANGER</a><a href="#1-what-are-the-toji-like-2-days-until-the-collab-event" class="h2" data-content-highlight="1-what-are-the-toji-like-2-days-until-the-collab-event">1: What Are the Toji Like? ~2 Days Until the Collab Event~</a><a href="#2-are-aradama-something-scary-1-days-until-the-collab-event" class="h2" data-content-highlight="2-are-aradama-something-scary-1-days-until-the-collab-event">2: Are Aradama Something Scary? ~1 Days Until the Collab Event~</a><a href="#1-the-doppelganger-rumors" class="h2" data-content-highlight="1-the-doppelganger-rumors">1: The Doppelganger Rumors</a><a href="#2-the-doppelgangers-true-form" class="h2" data-content-highlight="2-the-doppelgangers-true-form">2: The Doppelgangers' True Form</a><a href="#3-a-promise-for-after-were-done" class="h2" data-content-highlight="3-a-promise-for-after-were-done">3: A Promise for After We're Done</a><a href="#4-meeting-the-aradama" class="h2" data-content-highlight="4-meeting-the-aradama">4: Meeting the Aradama</a><a href="#5-a-hard-fought-battle" class="h2" data-content-highlight="5-a-hard-fought-battle">5: A Hard Fought Battle</a><a href="#6-our-magic" class="h2" data-content-highlight="6-our-magic">6: Our Magic</a><a href="#1-im-not-lettin-that-go" class="h2" data-content-highlight="1-im-not-lettin-that-go">1: I'm Not Lettin' That Go</a><a href="#2-playing-tag" class="h2" data-content-highlight="2-playing-tag">2: Playing Tag</a><a href="#3-are-you-a-sly-dog-or-what" class="h2" data-content-highlight="3-are-you-a-sly-dog-or-what">3: Are You a Sly Dog or What?</a></div></div><div id="-codedoc-toc" class="toc-0-0-8"><script>
