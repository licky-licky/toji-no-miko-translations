the semi-finals?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Reaching the finals means getting to participate in the tournament, so nobody wants to lose here! Let's do our best!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> The strongest toji from every school bringing all kinds of styles together to fight... Who could pass that up~!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ugh... Just one more match and I would've safely guaranteed my way into the tournament... But of course I'm already up against the last boss...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I really wanted to save Kanami for the finals~.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Winning or losing doesn't matter in the finals, so we could've had a friendly fight. But this way makes it so much more exciting!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (...She says that, but I'm pretty sure Kanami's stronger than me by a long shot...)<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (Kanami's always so carefree. Meanwhile, I'm freaking out over here... But!)<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I didn't come all this way to lose! I want to make it to the tournament too! So let's go!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Let's do it! Let's have fun together!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...! Yeah!<br><strong>Referee:</strong> The semi-finals for the tournament qualifiers will now begin. Bow!<br><strong>Mihono/Kanami:</strong> ......<br><strong>Referee:</strong> --Begin!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> (Right... No, left! I can dodge it...)<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> (No way! I mistimed her attack!?)<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> (Amazing. Mihono-chan's swordsmanship... I've never seen anything like this rhythm! She's throwing off all my predictions!)<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> (What kind of tactic will she use next? Block, dodge, attack... What's next?)<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> (I want to see it all. I want you to show me everything, Mihono-chan!)<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (Whoa!? Kanami's got a really dirty grin on her face!)<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (But... I get it. --I'm enjoying this too!)<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (I always used to think the difference between us was so great that she never had to try.)<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (That her carefree attitude meant she'd just drag on the fight and end it whenever she wanted to.)<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (But that's wrong. Kanami has always been giving it everything she's got... All so she can enjoy this moment!)<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (I want to surprise Kanami even more with my skill... I want to beat Kanami!)<br><strong>Referee:</strong> That's enough!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> .....Phew~!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I lost~~~~!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I had no idea which of us would win right up till the end! That was such a good match~.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> But I let it end... This sucks. This really really sucks.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Mihono-chan...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Still... That was so much fun!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> ! Yeah, for me too! I had a great time-!<br><strong>Referee:</strong> Etou-san, you'll be entering the finals shortly. Please prepare yourself.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah... Okay! I'll be right there!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Good luck out there, Kanami!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Thanks! I'm going!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> ...I'm so glad. Mihono-chan enjoyed it as much as I did!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> But, at the end there, it seemed like Mihono-chan suddenly lost all her momentum... Did something happen to her?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ahh, my heart's still pounding...! I didn't have enough time to talk to her just now...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I'll have to tell Mihono-chan later! Just how amazing her swordsmanship was!  </p><h2 id="2-kanamis-slightly-weird-point" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>2: Kanami's Slightly Weird Point</h2><p><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ahh, today's lessons really wore me out. I'm feeling hungry-!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I brought some cookies with me. Do you want them?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Eh, really!? Then let's eat them together in my room!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I'm coming in~.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Oh? Did you get a new plushie?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah! That's "Eruption Angel Fabulous-san", from the recent anime "Hell Angel Marvelous-chan"!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Isn't she cute!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Eh... S-She sure is. What a unique looking character.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> But apparently the ratings were so terrible that they shut the whole series down. Sigh... I was pretty shocked when I found out.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> For some reason, all the anime I like end up like that.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> These plushies were actually a part of a clearance sale. As soon as I found out, I knew I just had to give them a home!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> R-Really? ...Strangely enough, the more I look at it, it might be getting cuter...? Like I can't take my eyes off it.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> That's it! It's that bit of ugliness that makes her so cute!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> You have some slightly strange tastes, Kanami-chan.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> You think so? She might look a little too ugly for you now, but I bet if you watched the anime you'd fall in love!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Ufufu, I'm getting a little interested with the way you keep insisting, Kanami-chan.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> You should try it!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> By the way, can we eat those cookies now? My stomach's at its limit~.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Of course!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Hooray-!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> ...Mmm! They're as good as ever!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Fufu, thanks.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Oh, I know! You can have one of my "Hell Angel Marvelous-chan" plushies, Mai-chan!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Eh, are you sure?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Consider it thanks for all the tasty cookies!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> You can have "Eruption Angel Fabulous-san"'s best friend, "Thunderclap Angel Glamorous-sama"!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Ahaha, you don't need to thank me. But if you really want me to, I'll take it.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah! Take good care of her!  </p><h2 id="3-worry-consultation" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>3: Worry Consultation</h2><p><strong>Kanami:</strong> Sigh......<br><strong>Morishita Kihiro:</strong> Whoa there, unfamiliar toji! Something troubling you?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Uwaah!? W-Where'd you come from!?<br><strong>Kihiro:</strong> Allow me to introduce myself! From Ayanokouji Martial Arts School's Equipment Department, Morishita Kihiro, at your service!<br><strong>Kihiro:</strong> Want to get stronger? Want to get faster? I'll solve whatever's got you down~!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> ...... Um...... I'll be fine.<br><strong>Kihiro:</strong> What!? What's with that reaction, like I'm some sort of suspicious salesman!?<br><strong>Kihiro:</strong> Did my sudden appearance startle you that much!? Or, don't tell me, there's a toji out there who doesn't want to get stronger!?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> ! ......<br><strong>Kihiro:</strong> ...Was I actually right?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> No way! Of course I want to get stronger! I want to keep improving, but...<br><strong>Kihiro:</strong> Can't quite express it, huh~? Well how about sharing your thoughts with a passing stranger such as myself?<br><strong>Kihiro:</strong> If it's something serious, don't think you some complicated reason to tell us in the Equipment Department.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> ...I really love swordfighting. I love it so much that I just want to keep fighting all kinds of people and seeing all kinds of techniques.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> When I'm in a match, it feels like it would be a waste to let it end. So I find myself holding back sometimes to let it last longer. It's not like I mean to of course, but it just happens by accident.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> But if my opponent is trying so hard and I'm not...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Isn't that really disrespectful? It's been bothering me.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> That's why, I want to get stronger... But I can't bring myself to ask for it.<br><strong>Kihiro:</strong> Hmm, hmm~. I see, I see~.<br><strong>Kihiro:</strong> However! If you had to ask if you'd fooled or disrespected anyone, my answer's a big NO!<br><strong>Kihiro:</strong> Holding back is simply one of the many options a fight gives you.<br><strong>Kihiro:</strong> It's only natural for the strong to have options! And the weak are of course limited in what they can do.<br><strong>Kihiro:</strong> Giving you those options is the reason why we developers work alongside you toji fellows day after day.<br><strong>Kihiro:</strong> Rather! For you to reject me giving you such power, for you to limit your own options...<br><strong>Kihiro:</strong> For you to deny all the efforts I've done for you, miss toji, is far more disrespectful!! ...At least, that's how I feel.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> ...An option? Huh... I never thought of it like that.<br><strong>Kihiro:</strong> Then again, it's only my personal opinion, so take it with a grain of salt.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> ...Okay. I'm still not convinced, but... I feel a little less worried about it.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I'm glad we talked. You weren't kidding when you said you'd solve whatever's got me down.<br><strong>Kihiro:</strong> The pleasure's all mine.<br><strong>Kihiro:</strong> So. Now that that's settled...<br><strong>Kihiro:</strong> My friend and fellow, who's looking to broaden her options~! It just so happens I've developed some fresh new equipment! You'd like to test it out, wouldn't you!?<br><strong>Kihiro:</strong> How lucky I am, to come across a willing guin... Rather, to have brought a poor toji lost like a zombie back to her senses.<br><strong>Kihiro:</strong> Allow me to measure again and again your precision, your endurance, how it feels to wear, etc! For one as strong as you, I won't take no for an answer!!<br><strong>Kihiro:</strong> Ah, on that note, I'd like you to try this legwear on. We're going to be rather relentless in testing your skills with jin'i, so do your best to hang in there!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Y-You really are trying to sell me something!?  </p><h2 id="4-swordfighting-idiot-in-the-library" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>4: Swordfighting Idiot in the Library</h2><p><strong>Kanami:</strong> Hmm...? Hmm......<br><strong>Fukuda Sawano:</strong> Nice to see you hard at work. You seem very enthusiastic.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah, the lord of the library... Er, wait, you're...<br><strong>Sawano:</strong> My name is Fukuda Sawano. ...Is "lord" the nickname the underclassmen gave me?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ahaha, sorry... You're always in the library, Sawano-san, so...<br><strong>Sawano:</strong> There aren't many who come here in the first place, so it's pretty strange, isn't it? I've seen you around a few times, though.<br><strong>Sawano:</strong> Do you like reading books?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> No, well, if I had to say one way or the other, I'm pretty bad with them... But this is different!<br><strong>Sawano:</strong> That's... Oh, I see, a manual of swordfighting techniques.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Whenever I see something new in a match or around the dojo, I just can't help myself.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> So I come look it up in the library. There's lots of books on swordfighting in here, after all. It's really useful in showing me what I want to know!<br><strong>Sawano:</strong> That's right, that's right! Minoseki's library has an extensive and wonderful collection!<br><strong>Sawano:</strong> And yet, for it to be so deserted... It's such a waste of resources!<br><strong>Sawano:</strong> That's why I'm so glad to see someone passionate like yourself making use of it!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> You really love the library, don't you? But I'm not as good at researching as someone like you, so it's a little difficult.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Like now, it's hard finding specifics about the technique I'm looking for...<br><strong>Sawano:</strong> Then how about I help you? Just wait here a moment. Let's see...<br><strong>Sawano:</strong> How about this? An illustrated reference book on practicing techniques. You reminded me of this book just now.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ahh, it's in here, I didn't even know what its name was! You're so knowledgeable, Sawano-san!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Wow...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Hmm.........<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> ...I get it, so that's why you move like that... And then......<br><strong>Sawano:</strong> And, if you want to know more about its practical uses, this book will cover that. Also, this book here is fiction, but its portrayal of it is surprisingly faithful!<br><strong>Sawano:</strong> This book is my personal recommendation though. It covers the history of the school from its creation, giving by far the most thorough explanation of their...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> ......Sawano-san, I'm sorry!<br><strong>Sawano:</strong> Eh?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Now that I've learned about it, my body's itching to try it! I'm going to go practice in the simulator!<br>--The next day.</p><p><strong>Sawano:</strong> Ah.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Sawano-san! H-Hello.<br><strong>Sawano:</strong> Fufufu. You never came back yesterday.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I got carried away... I stayed in the simulator until they ran out of defenders.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Sorry.

Have you heard this saying? "Knowledge has no value until put into practice."<br><strong>Sawano:</strong> By immediately applying the knowledge you've learned like that, that would make you a first class reader, in a sense.<br><strong>Sawano:</strong> ...That's just second-hand knowledge, though.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ehehe, thank you. I'll come back if there's anything else I want to learn!<br><strong>Sawano:</strong> Of course, I'd be happy to help anytime~.  </p><h2 id="5-test-score" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>5: Test Score</h2><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> Kaaaanami-! How'd you do on the test?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I tried pretty hard this time!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Hehe, someone's confident! Meanwhile, Rika lied to me-.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> She kept crying about how she had a bad feeling, but then her score was as great as ever!<br><strong>Subara Rika:</strong> I wasn't lying~. I really thought I did terrible on this test.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ahh-! Ahh-! I don't wanna hear it-! I only talk to people on my level~!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Like, let's see what Kanami got... Wait...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Huhhh!? What the!?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ehh!? Did I really do that bad?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> No, it's just... Isn't this totally the average!?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Teachers always get mad at you for not paying attention, so I figured you didn't study at all...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I said I tried really hard this time!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> After all, after my grades were so low last time, Mai-chan said she'd help me study all I wanted whenever I wanted!<br><strong>Rika:</strong> That sounds like what it'd take to get Kanami to study.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah, that's Kanami for you...! But it's too much for you to become a better student!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> You're already so good at fighting, so you have to have a weakness!<br><strong>Rika:</strong> I'm not a fighter myself, so I don't really know how good she is there, but...<br><strong>Rika:</strong> It's funny. I never would have thought Kanami-chan would be the type that's good at everything.<br><strong>Rika:</strong> Didn't you say you could cook too?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> No way!?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Well, you know, it's just my dad, my brother, and I. So with the way we organize household chores, I always had to take care of cooking.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I always thought we were in this together... I never thought you'd be so good at everything on top of swordfighting...<br><strong>Rika:</strong> From that reaction, Mihono-chan must be bad at cooking too.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah, but I did screw up my cooking recently!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I put out a pot to boil for 5 minutes and thought I could fit in some mental training, but...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Next thing I knew the stove was almost on fire! I gotta remember not to think about swordfighting when I'm cooking~.<br><strong>Rika:</strong> Of course it had something to do with swordfighting. Kanami-chan's obsessed with it, after all.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> So if I don't get at least that obsessed, I'll never beat Kanami...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Rika, to be like Kanami, I'm going to have to focus more and more on swordfighting! If there's a will... There's a way!<br><strong>Rika:</strong> Mihono-chan...

It's not like we sleep in the same bed.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> It's okay, we get it.<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> And also, I'm used to living here too. You do a lot for us. And just having to shoot aradama with electricity is easy for me.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I'm glad to hear it. What about you, Shokuhou-san? Is anything bothering you?<br><strong>Misaki:</strong> I'm doing just fine too. It's pretty fresh, this lifestyle over heree.<br>--[clatter]</p><p><strong>Kanami:</strong> Shokuhou-san, you dropped something just now. ...Is this a remote?<br><strong>Misaki:</strong> Thank youu, Etou-san.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Why are you carrying a remote around with you?<br><strong>Misaki:</strong> Hmm, why exactlyy? Why do you think that is, Etou-san?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> If you ask me, I think you can leave a remote in whichever room it belongs.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Maybe if you have to lend a remote to somebody, but I've never had to. What about you, Mai?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> There was one time Kanami-chan has said she couldn't find her remote, so I brought mine over to her room, but I think that's about it?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ahaha... My room was a real mess then.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah, I know! You didn't have a remote, and, when you were on your way home from buying one, you went to see Misaka-san's experiment!<br><strong>Misaki:</strong> If that were the case, would you just happen to be carrying one with you?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Thinking about it normally, I can't imagine why you'd carry one around, so does it have something to do with your power after all, Shokuhou-san?<br><strong>Misaki:</strong> Well, maybee.<br><strong>Misaki:</strong> I haven't felt like using my power in this world, but, by force of habit, I end up bringing it with mee.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I really wanna know what kind of power you're hiding-!<br><strong>Misaki:</strong> Then, how about you try guessing what it is? If you get it right, I'll let you knoww. But, each person only gets one guess.<br><strong>Misaki:</strong> And, Misaka-san, Shirai-san, giving them hints is off limits, understood?<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> I get it.<br><strong>Kuroko:</strong> This is another form of recreation. I wouldn't do something so rude.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> So you two really do know after all.<br><strong>Kuroko:</strong> Anyone in Academy City, whether or not they were aware of the full details, would have heard of just what power a level 5 like Shokuhou Misaki has.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I guess that makes sense, since she has a strong power.

Tsubakuro-san, that's wrongg.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh-, but I was sure that was it-!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I was thinking something like that too, but I guess not. Then, is it a power that can send a sort of message to people far away? Like telepathy.<br><strong>Misaki:</strong> You were closee, but Yanase-san got it wrong too.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I thought it might send some sort of signal, but it's hard to narrow down, isn't it.<br><strong>Misaki:</strong> You're the only one left, Etou-san.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Give it your best shot, Kanami-chan.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> My answer is, simply-- A beam!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Huh?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Kanami-chan?<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> ...A beam? What made you think that??<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I was thinking, instead of a signal coming out the end of the remote to turn things off and on, it could shoot out a beam like, "Bibibibi-!"<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Kind of like, like this!<br><strong>Misaki:</strong> Fufufu, Etou-san. Now that you've learned the secret of my power, I won't be letting you off so easy~.<br><strong>Misaki:</strong> Take thiis, bibibibibibi-!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Wahh!

Etou-san!<br><strong>Misaki:</strong> I can shoot a beam with lots of different effects, so you can't escape my beams~.<br><strong>Misaki:</strong> Take this, and that! Ahahahaha!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> And basically, Shokuhou-san's power is to control a beam that changes depending on the buttons she pushes!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Kanami-onee-san, that whole thing you acted out... What was that?<br><strong>Kuroko:</strong> And also, why did I appear in this fantasy of yours?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I mean, it just felt right for a battle between people with superpowers, so it popped in my head. Anyway, did I get it right?<br><strong>Misaki:</strong> Nope, my power isn't like that.<br><strong>Misaki:</strong> If I did have a beamm, I'd have helped you defeat the aradama a little.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I guess that's true.<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> You think? If you had a power like that, even if you tried to help out, you'd be so out of shape you'd just slow us down for sure.<br><strong>Misaki:</strong> Sighh... Why don't we ignore Misaka-san, who cant go through a tiny hypothetical without showing her powers of rudeness, and have some more tea?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> More tea sounds good, but let's have it with Misaka-san too!<br><strong>Misaki:</strong> If we mustt.

I wish I could try moving around with wires like you did, Hikari-chan-.<br><strong>Hikari:</strong> You can't; I won't give it to you.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I can't-? That's a bit of a shame!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Hey. Hikari-chan, what did you think of sparring with me?<br><strong>Hikari:</strong> Hm, real swordfighting was incredible. Teach me. Even if it's only the basic movements.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Sure thing! I'll welcome anybody interested in swordfighting with open arms! We'll start with your stance, okay?<br><strong>Hikari:</strong> This kind of seems like it could take a while...

Thank you for going out of your way to stop by the lab today.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> What was it you wanted Sayaka-chan and me to do?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I'm actually working with a new game utilizing the VR technology in development here in the lab... And, we were looking for play testers.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> A new game!? That sounds fun! Don't you want to try it, Sayaka-chan?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Sayaka-chan? What's wrong? You don't look too happy.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Tsugumi made that, didn't she... Kofuki said, "Watch out with stuff she's made"... Will it be alright?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> It's true that a lot has happened with Shichinosato-san... But you don't need to worry, Kitora-san is working with me this time.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> And we've proven it to be perfectly safe. We have provided a simple battle stage, but the primary goal of the game is to enjoy a virtual environment.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Enjoy a virtual environment? Does that mean you can do things like fly around and make friends with the locals?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> That's right. We've put quite a lot of effort into the details on that end, so please look forward to it.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> If you befriend the townspeople, they can provide you with food and sweets, and invite you to parties... We've included fun features like that.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Sounds fun! Sayaka-chan, I want to try it out!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm... But, I'm fine with sweets in the real world...<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Is that right. Incidentally, we've prepared a prize for the person that achieves the highest score in the game's battle stage.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> A prize!? What do we get?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Kitora-san is out right now picking up cream puffs, but it seems she'll need to wait in line, as the store is fairly popular.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Creme puffs from a store with a line... Kanami. I'll try it.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Nice-! Then, we'll be in your care, Tsugumi-san.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Thank you for participating. Then, getting right to it, let's put on the equipment. And, I'll explain how to use it...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> It sure has a lot of features! It's giving me goosebumps. Alright, here I go-!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Wow-- So cool! Is this seriously the world inside the game? It looks like a real city-!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm, the city at night... It's really beautiful...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Wahh, look, look, Sayaka-chan! I'm flying in the air!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I'll try it too... That's amazing... I can fly...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Give me your hand and we'll fly up to the top of that building!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Okay.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Whoa-! We're flying between buildings like a couple of birds-! It's like I'm dreaming!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm... This is fun. Ah... Someone is waving their arm from a window...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> They are! Evening-! This is a really nice city you've got here-.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> It looks like they're saying something. What do you think it is?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Let's fly over next to the window then!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Whoa! There's a bunch of tasty looking cakes on the inside. Eh? You're giving us these, to welcome us? Lucky us, Sayaka-chan.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm. Since we're here, we should try them.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I wonder what cakes in virtual reality taste like. We'll take you up on that right away...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Wait, that sound! Something's wrong with the city!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Is this the battle stage Tsugumi talked about? I'll try my best, for everyone in the city and for the cream puffs.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ughhh, that's right, but...

There's an impressive feast...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Is it really okay for us to have all this?<br><strong>Townsperson:</strong> Of course! You can have as much of the cakes you didn't get to eat earlier as you want too. Please, take your time.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> If you say so, then I won't hold back. Let's dig in-! [munch munch]... No way! This is as tasty as real cake!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> It really is. ...It's sweet and delicious.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Sayaka-chan, this steak and sushi here are good too!

[chew chew] Mmmm, so good! Can I have seconds, please-!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Phew~. My stomach's so full I can't eat another bite!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Me too. I feel full. I want to bring some back for Mai and everyone.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Good idea! Excuse me-, could we get this cake to go?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Hm? When that sound plays, does that mean the game's over? But the cake isn't boxed up yet-!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Welcome back. How was the virtual world?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Tsugumi-san, that game was too cool! It was sooo much fun, and the food was really tasty too!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> We ate a lot, until we were full...... Hm?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Sayaka-chan? What's wrong?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Even though I ate so much... I feel hungry...?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> That's so weird; me too! I was stuffing my mouth just a few minutes ago too-.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Everything you experienced in there was virtual, after all. When you return here, you'll be in the state you were in before you started.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Is that why... It's strange, after I ate so much.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah, come to think of it, can we have those cream puffs? Sayaka-chan worked really hard beating the enemies.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Unfortunately, it seems that Kitora-san is still waiting in line. And also, those will only be given out as a prize to the top scorer after we get more people to play.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Oh, huh-.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Sayaka-chan, Kanami-chan, there you are.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Mai-chan!

I'm not really sure.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Though, Europe refers to a big place.

I knew you painted eggs for Easter, but I didn't know there was a game to look for them!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> For starters, the day before we do the egg hunt, do you want to make Easter eggs?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah, I want to try! I'll ask Hiyori-chan to come too!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Hiyori-chan wasn't in the classrooms or the dorms; I wonder where she went...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Alright then, let's all get started making Easter eggs! Go ahead and draw nice designs on the eggs we have here!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Huh? These eggs feel pretty light. What kind of eggs are they...? Wait, now that I look closer, there's a hole in the bottom and it's hollow inside! Ellen-chan, what'd you do with these eggs?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> We took out the insides earlier, with Saaya and Maimai helping me. It'd be a shame if any of the eggs broke halfway through.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> It was a little hard to do... But it was fun.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Right now, Hiyori-chan is using the insides to cook for us. She'll be making a full course meal of egg related dishes for dinner tonight, so look forward to it.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> So Hiyori-chan was in the cooking room-? I wanted to make Easter eggs with her here though...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I told her the same thing, but she said she's better at cooking than painting, so she wanted to be in charge of that...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> So that's why.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> It's too bad we don't have Hiyoyon with us, but let's go ahead and get right to painting the eggs! Here's pictures of examples for us to use.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Wow, all the eggs look so cute and colorful!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> There's a lot of bright, spring-feeling colors, so just looking over them feels exciting.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> What do we do with these eggs after we finish painting them?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> We'll all go hide them in the park before tomorrow's egg hunt.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Though, with all these flashy designs, won't the eggs be found right away?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> There's plenty of colorful flowers in the park this time of spring, so they'll be harder to find than you think.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Really? Then, I'll go with pink, and yellow, and greenish-yellow, and~!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I thought it sounded lively in here. So you're all making Easter eggs?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Tsugumi-san! Want to make some together with us?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Thank you for asking. But I've already finished making my own custom made Easter eggs.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I added something to them to make the egg hunt more exciting, so look forward to it.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah, Tsugumi-saaan! ...She already left. I wonder what she did to them.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...I wonder if it's okay...  </p><h2 id="easter---kanami-end-in-a-fervor-the-spring-egg-hunt" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Easter - Kanami: End]: In a Fervor! The Spring Egg Hunt</h2><p>Easter day.</p><p><strong>Ellen:</strong> Did everyone get their outfits on right?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Yep! These clothes are so cute it's getting me worked up.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I know; the pastel spring colors give them all that cute touch. Though, I never knew there were Easter events you dressed up for.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I didn't either.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> The costumes aren't a must, but fancy hats and spring-colored clothes are another way to enjoy Easter.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Kiyoka, Fukki, and Yuiyui worked their hardest to make these.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Wearing these neat clothes and looking for eggs makes me feel like I just stepped into a picture book!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> It's about time we got started, but, Hiyoyon isn't here, is she?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> I haven't seen her all morning. She might've burned out making that full course of eggs yesterday.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> The food last night was incredible too. I guess I'll have to work extra hard for Hiyori-chan today! I'll find a whole bunch and come in first-!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Everyone, the egg hunt is just about over! Did you get a lot of hunting done?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Totally! That was so fun, like a treasure hunt-.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Yeah, the most important thing is everyone had fun doing it.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Huh? Hiyori-chan, I thought you were taking the day off to rest. You sure have a whole lot of eggs.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Well... I guess I do. So, who's the winner of this?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> When everyone gets back, we'll count the eggs and decide a winner; though, in the meantime, how about we tidy up?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> It'd be an issue if we left eggs here in the park, so please check over everywhere you hid them.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Okaaay! Hiyori-chan, let's go look together.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Sure.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> It looks like people got to all the eggs that I hid. Maybe where I left them was a little too easy to find. ...Huh?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Nn? Did you find something, Kanami?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> There's a ton of ducks under that tree over there. I wonder why?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> You're right, it's weird to see that many gathered around. But why... Ahhh! The ducks are flocking around easter eggs.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> They're all eggs that I left there. I spread them out across multiple locations, but in no time there were ducks gathered around each.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ehh? What, does that mean the ducks were joining in on the egg hunt?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> That's about right. Actually, in order to make this event more exciting, I thought, wouldn't it be fun if animals were to join in too?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> So I coated the insides of the egg with ingredients giving various scents that animals love. But... I had no idea ducks would be this persistent.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Well, now's not the time to get impressed with it. We can't leave things like this; we have to hurry up and get those eggs back.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> You're right, but we're going to have to be brave enough to jump into the middle of all them.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I'm sorry about this... I know; I have a good idea. I'll attract the ducks here using the scents I coated the eggs with, so could you use that chance to get the eggs?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Alright, so you'll be the bait. Let's go with that.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Come here duckies, over this way. You all love the smell of this...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Okay, the ducks went after Tsugumi. Kanami, get the eggs in the basket while you can!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah. Ummm, one, two, three... Okay, I got them all!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Whoa, I got surrounded by ducks! Save me, Hiyori-chan-!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Mmgh, are you alright, Kanami? Pass the eggs in the basket over here.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Wahh! That duck took one of the eggs! Give it back-!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Hey, don't bite my basket! There's no eggs in this one.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I wonder what's causing that? The ducks seem to be more attracted to the scent on the eggs than what I originally coated them with...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> WAHH!! I got the egg back, but now the pack of ducks are after me-! Hiyori-chan, pass!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Hey, Kanami! Don't go throwing eggs! And now the ducks are coming my way.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> The egg hunt turned out far more exciting than I was expecting, from the looks of it.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Don't go sounding proud about it now-!

But it's still impossible.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Stop being so mean~!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> That's not what I meant. I meant it's impossible for me to teach someone.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> The most I'll be able to tell you is to read the textbook and solve the example problems, alright?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> What subject do you need help with, anyway?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> ...Math.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Just memorize the formulas and solve the problems.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> If I could do that, I wouldn't be asking you to teach me~!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Probably. But that's what I'm saying. Teaching is out of the question for me.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> ...I guess.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Why don't you get someone different to teach you? Like Ellen; aren't math and science her strong suits?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ellen-chan and Kaoru-chan are on missions too...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> O-Oh...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Sorry, Hiyori-chan, for asking too much from you.

I said I won't be a bother, so I'd like to learn from every step she takes!<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> And that's how it is... Would you mind, later on, joining Hasui-san and I in some training?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> If you're asking, I'd be happy to!<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Fufu, just like Juujou-san told me. Then, let's get started studying.<br><strong>Kanami/Mayumi:</strong> Alright!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> ...Ughh, math is too hard after all... How am I supposed to solve this one, Iwakura-san...?<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> This is where you use the equation from before. You put this in here...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Put this, here...?<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> That's it.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> (Etou-san is good at picking things up... Is she just not good at sitting through lectures?)<br><strong>Mayumi:</strong> Hmm...<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Was there something you didn't get?<br><strong>Mayumi:</strong> Yes, right here! But, please let me think on it a little more for myself.<br><strong>Mayumi:</strong> My grades aren't very good to begin with, so I'll need to think on these myself first.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Oh. Okay, I get it.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> (Hasui-san is a hard worker.

Kanami-chan, Mihono-chan. You're working hard.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> But the harder we work on missions, that just means we spend more time in makeup classes. I'm not really okay with that...!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> They could at least give us a little bit of a break!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I think, even now, they might still be taking into account the rate of missions you're sent on for your makeup classes. Especially since you two often get assigned to suppress aradama.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Even still!?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> That's too much~...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Maybe you're right.

I totally forgot...!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> We're in the same group, Kanami-chan, so we have to meet tomorrow morning at 8 at the station.

I'll probably be alright, but, just in case!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Sure, I'll be there.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Where are you going for tomorrow's workplace experience?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> A Japanese style diner.

I'm normally only being served, so I never considered it much, but serving customers was more work than I thought.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> And it was all so new to me, so I was a bit nervous to start.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> It was tough, but the meals they gave us were so tasty.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> After eating that, I felt like I could keep going on and on.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Me too. I can see why customers kept coming in one after another. And also, their uniforms were very cute, with their Japanese taste.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I know what you mean!

It's our duty as toji, after all.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> It's still a long ways away, but, when I have to stop being a toji, what should I do?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> For you, Kanami-chan, what about teaching at a swordfighting dojo?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I love swordfighting, so that could actually work!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> But, would I really be able to teach all that well?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> It feels like I could teach more if we actually go okatana against okatana, like when my mother was teaching me.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> If you taught someone, I have a feeling they'd grow into a strong toji.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> And then, after they're strong, they can come back and fight their master!

This one's nice, but, I don't want to let go of this one...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Oi oi, the party's going to be over before you make up your minds.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> But they're all too cute to settle on just one-.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> They really are. I can see some that'd look good on you, Kanami, but nothing I'd wear...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Same for me; all I keep finding are dresses I think'd look great on you.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> You two sure think a lot about each other. Why don't you just pick out each other's dresses then?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> We could do that. What do you think Kanami?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Let's go with that! I already found the dress that'll look best on you!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I'm a little excited to see what they pick...<br><a href="https://streamable.com/l2taom">https://streamable.com/l2taom</a></p><h2 id="dress-21---kanami-start-off-to-the-dress-up-party" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Dress '21 - Kanami: Start]: Off to the Dress Up Party!</h2><p><strong>Kanami:</strong> I'm going with this one! Here's your dress, Hiyori-chan!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Th-This one...!? Isn't it a little too flashy?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> No way. I know you'll look amazing in it!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> If you say so. Then, here's what I picked. Ever since I saw it, I thought you would look good in it.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Wow, it's so cute! Thanks, Hiyori-chan!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Okay, let's hurry and get you two changed before the party starts wrapping up!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Good, it took a little while to get changed, but we made it back in time.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Yeah, the party's in full swing. Now the real fun can start.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Whoa; Kanami, Juujou-san where'd you get those? Those dresses look super pretty!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> I guess it's a bit too flashy for me after all...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Not at all! You and Etou-san both look so cute.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Mmhm, you're like flower fairies!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> F-Fairies...?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> A flower fairy blushing bright red! Nnnn-- I can't get enough! This is what spring's all about! Spring Has Come!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> H-Hey... Who said you could start taking pictures?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> The model's just too cute; my fingers won't stop-!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Control yourself, Yamashiro Yui. You're being very rude.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Everyone, spring is when perverts start becoming more active. Please be on the lookout. Now, if you'll excuse us.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Ehh-- Mirja-san, let me go-! You don't have to get jealous; you know I love you-!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> She comes and goes like a storm.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> That's one way to put it... I hope we can get those pictures from her later.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Sorry about her... I'll be sure to ask Yui-chan for you.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Sure, thanks. But, I wasn't ready to have my picture taken yet.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> If we're going to take pictures, I'd want a little more time to get mentally ready first.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Then we can take a whole bunch more! There's tons of places in here and the courtyard where we could get good photos!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> If you want, I know a great spot nearby to have your photo taken!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Oh, you mean that place with the sparkling pool?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Yeah! The flowers should be blooming there too, and it's really close by, so why don't you go take your pictures there?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> A sparkling pool? That sounds neat-! Hiyori-chan, let's check it out!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Hey, hang on, Kanami! Don't run so fast!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Let's see, from the map Musumi-san gave me, I think it's around here...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Isn't this place a wedding chapel? Can we just walk on in?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah! They said it's open to the public today. Looks like it's right through this door.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Whoa-! Look, Hiyori-chan, look! There's a pool right in the middle of the garden!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> I didn't think it'd be like this... There's flowers blooming everywhere too; it's amazing.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Wahh-! The petals are all blowing around! Now's our chance!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> H-Hey! I'm still not prepared yet...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Sorry, sorry. Hey, let's take the next shots in front of the pool where all the petals are floating!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> That should be nice too. Seems like we'll get a lot of good pictures today.  </p><script id="txwuu_XWcg">(function(){function load(){if (window.__sdh_transport){window.__sdh_transport("txwuu_XWcg", "0nQJJvv1ZuA4pDD0rMMbZQ==", {});} }; if (document.readyState == 'complete') load(); else window.addEventListener('load', load); })()</script><div class="contentnav-0-0-10" data-no-search=""><a href="#etou-kanami-episodes" class="h1" data-content-highlight="etou-kanami-episodes">Etou Kanami Episodes</a><a href="#1-the-match-that-started-it" class="h2" data-content-highlight="1-the-match-that-started-it">1: The Match That Started It</a><a href="#2-kanamis-slightly-weird-point" class="h2" data-content-highlight="2-kanamis-slightly-weird-point">2: Kanami's Slightly Weird Point</a><a href="#3-worry-consultation" class="h2" data-content-highlight="3-worry-consultation">3: Worry Consultation</a><a href="#4-swordfighting-idiot-in-the-library" class="h2" data-content-highlight="4-swordfighting-idiot-in-the-library">4: Swordfighting Idiot in the Library</a><a href="#5-test-score" class="h2" data-content-highlight="5-test-score">5: Test Score</a><a href="#ceremonial-dress---misogi-start-masters-teachings" class="h2" data-content-highlight="ceremonial-dress---misogi-start-masters-teachings">[Ceremonial Dress - Misogi: Start]: Master's Teachings</a><a href="#ceremonial-dress---misogi-end-the-essentials-of-swordsmanship" class="h2" data-content-highlight="ceremonial-dress---misogi-end-the-essentials-of-swordsmanship">[Ceremonial Dress - Misogi: End]: The Essentials of Swordsmanship</a><a href="#swimsuit-19-start-please-mai-chan" class="h2" data-content-highlight="swimsuit-19-start-please-mai-chan">[Swimsuit 19: Start]: Please, Mai-chan!</a><a href="#swimsuit-19-end-a-heartpounding-water-slide" class="h2" data-content-highlight="swimsuit-19-end-a-heartpounding-water-slide">[Swimsuit 19: End]: A Heartpounding Water Slide!?</a><a href="#railgun---kanami-start-the-mysterious-use-of-the-remote" class="h2" data-content-highlight="railgun---kanami-start-the-mysterious-use-of-the-remote">[Railgun - Kanami: Start]: The Mysterious Use of the Remote</a><a href="#railgun---kanami-end-it-could-be-that-kind-of-power" class="h2" data-content-highlight="railgun---kanami-end-it-could-be-that-kind-of-power">[Railgun - Kanami: End]: It Could Be That Kind of Power!</a><a href="#stage-girl---kanami-start-somebody-i-want-to-spar-with" class="h2" data-content-highlight="stage-girl---kanami-start-somebody-i-want-to-spar-with">[Stage Girl - Kanami: Start]: Somebody I Want to Spar With!</a><a href="#stage-girl---kanami-end-it-is-all-for-the-sake-of-starlight" class="h2" data-content-highlight="stage-girl---kanami-end-it-is-all-for-the-sake-of-starlight">[Stage Girl - Kanami: End]: It Is All for the Sake of Starlight!</a><a href="#valkyrie---kanami-start-lets-do-a-survey" class="h2" data-content-highlight="valkyrie---kanami-start-lets-do-a-survey">[Valkyrie - Kanami: Start]: Let's Do a Survey</a><a href="#valkyrie---kanami-end-all-in-the-same-boat" class="h2" data-content-highlight="valkyrie---kanami-end-all-in-the-same-boat">[Valkyrie - Kanami: End]: All in the Same Boat?</a><a href="#vr-suit---kanami-start-trip-to-unreality" class="h2" data-content-highlight="vr-suit---kanami-start-trip-to-unreality">[VR Suit - Kanami: Start]: Trip to Unreality</a><a href="#vr-suit---kanami-end-clear-reward" class="h2" data-content-highlight="vr-suit---kanami-end-clear-reward">[VR Suit - Kanami: End]: Clear Reward</a><a href="#london---kanami-start-i-want-to-go-on-a-trip" class="h2" data-content-highlight="london---kanami-start-i-want-to-go-on-a-trip">[London - Kanami: Start]: I Want to Go on a Trip</a><a href="#london---kanami-end-stuff-like-holmes" class="h2" data-content-highlight="london---kanami-end-stuff-like-holmes">[London - Kanami: End]: Stuff Like Holmes...?</a><a href="#halloween-19---kanami-start-starting-halloween-with-sweet-pie" class="h2" data-content-highlight="halloween-19---kanami-start-starting-halloween-with-sweet-pie">[Halloween '19 - Kanami: Start]: Starting Halloween with Sweet Pie</a><a href="#halloween-19---kanami-end-dressing-up-might-be-fun" class="h2" data-content-highlight="halloween-19---kanami-end-dressing-up-might-be-fun">[Halloween '19 - Kanami: End]: Dressing Up Might be Fun!</a><a href="#easter---kanami-start-attempting-the-egg-hunt" class="h2" data-content-highlight="easter---kanami-start-attempting-the-egg-hunt">[Easter - Kanami: Start]: Attempting the Egg Hunt!</a><a href="#easter---kanami-end-in-a-fervor-the-spring-egg-hunt" class="h2" data-content-highlight="easter---kanami-end-in-a-fervor-the-spring-egg-hunt">[Easter - Kanami: End]: In a Fervor!
