The sea! It's the sea~!!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> I seriously never thought I'd be sent to a beach resort instead of on another expedition...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> It's too bad Hanahana and Yomiyomi couldn't come along, but I'm impressed with the manager's generosity; inviting all the toji who helped with the aradama at the wedding chapel to come here.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Ahh, this feels great... Ah-! Hang on a sec, what if that's a flag...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Ufufu, you're such a pessimist, Kaoru-san. There's nothing to worry about. We aren't here for a mission; this is a true and honest vacation.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> As an apology for suspecting Yamashiro Yui, and out of gratitude at suppressing the aradama and returning the wedding rings, the manager made it very clear that would be the case.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Yeah, that's true. Then, let's get this vacation started... Or I'd like to, but we ought to thank Yui first for all this. Where is she anyway?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> As soon as we arrived, Yui-chan went chasing off after some bride, so she could be anywhere.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> They call this place a sacred spot for resort weddings, after all~. There's a lot of brides around!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I see Yamashiro Yui still hasn't learned her lesson. Though, I suppose it was thanks to that side of her that we were rewarded like this...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Hang on? Where did everyone else go?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> They went to the resort's wedding hall, to see a wedding photo of Juujou-san's mother there.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> A resort wedding, huh? That's a pretty flashy thing to do for Hiyoyon's mama.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> No, to be more precise, it doesn't sound as if she actually held her wedding ceremony at the resort.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> But then why would there be a photo of her here?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I'm not sure of the details. Did you hear anything about it, Setouchi Chie?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> I don't know much myself, but the story of when that photo was taken is supposed to be what led to this resort becoming a popular wedding spot. It's amazing, isn't it?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I'd love to hear the full story-! I'm going to go check it out. Want to come with me, Kaoru?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> No thanks. Even if we aren't on duty, it's the fate of us wage slaves that anything could come up at any time. Gotta enjoy yourself while you can...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Ugh... Right on schedule. And there's no way they're calling about good news.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Yes, this is Kitora... I see... Yes, we will move out at once.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Is it aradama?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Yes, within the area of this resort, it seems there is an infestation of aradama. There is a great number of them too. Unfortunately, our vacation will have to be temporarily suspended. Let's gather everyone together.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Did aradama really show up?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> We have to be ready to go on the double!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Before we do that, just as a precaution, will everyone please take out their airline tickets. It would be a serious issue if one were to get lost, so we should collect them and leave them in the valuables locker at the hotel.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Good idea, Mirja-san! It would be awful if anyone lost theirs.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Huhh-? No way! I lost my plane ticket!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> You're so clumsy, Mihono-chan, losing something that important... Wait, hold on! Mine's gone too-!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Ugh, mine too...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> You should all put more consideration into managing yourselves. I have my ticket secured right here...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Oi, Mirja! Isn't that case for your glasses? Why'd you put it in there?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Because it's a valuable item I cannot afford to lose... Oh, it seems my ticket is gone as well.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> If everyone's tickets all vanished at once, I can't imagine it was any ordinary thief that did it, can you?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> What if it's aradama taking things again?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> That's highly plausible. As we are now, none of us will be able to return home. Let's defeat the aradama and recover our airline tickets.  </p><h2 id="2-eternal-vacation---epilogue" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>2: Eternal Vacation - Epilogue</h2><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> We suppressed all the aradama and got everyone's airplane tickets back, so now we're free to have our vacation!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Why... We should have defeated every one of the aradama, and yet, my airline ticket is the only one still missing...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Eh? You weren't able to find yours, Mirja-san? Everyone else's were there though...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ehh-, then that means, Mirja-san won't be able to come back home?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> This is a problem. All of the aradama should have been suppressed... Sigh, just what should I do...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Oh yeah! I just thought of something. There was a flyer outside the wedding hall that said they were looking for helpers before.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> If we all pitch in, we might be able to make enough for a ticket back home!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Good idea! Let's go check it out now!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I can't apologize enough. You should be having your vacation, and yet you're helping me...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Don't feel bad about it. It wasn't your fault your ticket got lost, after all.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm. I'll work hard with everyone.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> That wedding hall owes us for what my mom did for them too. I'm sure they'll let us work without any hassle. Let's go see.<br><strong>Everyone:</strong> Yeah!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> I finally get to come to a resort, and now I have to work...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> No point in complaining about it. Come on, let's go!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Sigh... Goodbye, blue skies, goodbye, blue sea...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Everyone, please wait. This is a rare opportunity, so you should enjoy your vacation as we planned.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Are you fine with that...?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I can stay behind and work here long enough to purchase an airline ticket on my own.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> You have a responsibility to make the best of your time here, recovering your strength so you can be ready for the next battle. Please, go on, and don't worry about me.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> But, you must have been looking forward to this too, Mirja-san... Looking forward to having fun with everyone... It's a little heartbreaking.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah, I know. Saying something like that, trying not to make us feel bad, you're being too nice. I can't take it...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Mmhmm, and, on top of that, you have that nice hot body. These slender legs that go all the way up... Stare...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Hey, Yui-chan! Why are you looking up Mirja-san's skirt!?  
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Ya-Yamashiro Yui!? You're molesting me at a time like this!?  
<strong>Yui:</strong> I'm not molesting anybody~! Look what I found, Mirja-san! Here, on the inside of your skirt.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> The inside of my skirt...? Ah---!!!!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> No way-! The stolen airline ticket was sewn underneath her skirt all along!!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I of all people should have remembered...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Nn? What's going on? Didn't the aradama-chan take it?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Everyone, I am incredibly sorry for the trouble I have caused. I completely forgot that I had decided to sew my ticket onto the underside of my skirt, thinking it wouldn't be lost that way.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ehh-!? But, didn't you say yesterday that you put it in your glasses case so it wouldn't get lost?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Yes. I did put it there yesterday, but, for security reasons, I routinely changed its location.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> From under the insole of my shoe, to inside my glasses case. After that, I transferred it to several other places...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> And I had entirely forgotten I had moved it to the inside of my skirt.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Even for a false alarm that's going a little far, don't you think.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> It's fine, Kaoru-chan. I'm just glad we found it.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> That's for sure. Still, short of x-ray vision, how did you realize it was there in the first place, Yamashiro-san?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Welll, I just had a feeling her skirt wasn't swaying around the way it usually does~.  
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I see that perversion of yours has proved itself useful yet again. Regardless, thank you very much for your help here.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Cool, we found the airplane ticket just fine, so before anything screws this up, let's get right to our vacation.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I'm all for it! Let's change into our swimsuits straight away!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Change into our swimsuits... That would cause trouble for me. I'll have to move the airline ticket to a more secure location first...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Give it a rest already-!  </p><script id="nBSjNkLLUN">(function(){function load(){if (window.__sdh_transport){window.__sdh_transport("nBSjNkLLUN", "0nQJJvv1ZuA4pDD0rMMbZQ==", {});} }; if (document.readyState == 'complete') load(); else window.addEventListener('load', load); })()</script><div class="contentnav-0-0-11" data-no-search=""><a href="#eternal-vacation" class="h1" data-content-highlight="eternal-vacation">Eternal Vacation</a><a href="#1-eternal-vacation---prologue" class="h2" data-content-highlight="1-eternal-vacation---prologue">1: Eternal Vacation - Prologue</a><a href="#2-eternal-vacation---epilogue" class="h2" data-content-highlight="2-eternal-vacation---epilogue">2: Eternal Vacation - Epilogue</a></div></div><div id="-codedoc-toc" class="toc-0-0-8"><div class="content-0-0-9"><p><a href="/tnm-translations/">Home</a></p><div class="collapse-0-0-4 "><script id="FumDHtxLeX">(function(){function load(){if (window.__sdh_transport){window.__sdh_transport("FumDHtxLeX", "aKxVAFZzmSrnhtZ+q9ZJ2w==", {});} }; if (document.readyState == 'complete') load(); else window.addEventListener('load', load); })()</script><div class="label" onclick="this.parentElement.classList.toggle('open')"><span class="text">Main Story</span><span class="icon-font closed">chevron_right</span></div><div class="content"><div class="collapse-0-0-4 "><script id="lhWmrWYwwY">(function(){function load(){if (window.__sdh_transport){window.__sdh_transport("lhWmrWYwwY", "aKxVAFZzmSrnhtZ+q9ZJ2w==", {});} }; if (document.readyState == 'complete') load(); else window.addEventListener('load', load); })()</script><div class="label" onclick="this.parentElement.classList.toggle('open')"><span class="text">Part 1: Formation</span><span class="icon-font closed">chevron_right</span></div><div class="content"><p><a href="/tnm-translations/docs/1_-_On_the_Other_Side_of_the_Tournament">1 - On the Other Side of the Tournament</a>
