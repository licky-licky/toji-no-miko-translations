<strong>Mai:</strong> You can&#x27;t do that. This is a school event, so you would cause the whole group to become disorganized.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> I wasn&#x27;t serious! What were you, on the student council in a past life, in the morals committee now, and shooting for class president in the next one!?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That&#x27;s rude, Kofuki-san! Though, I don&#x27;t really understand what you&#x27;re saying!?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> It&#x27;s not rude, you got it all wrong, Kiyoka. I&#x27;m just looking out for Mai.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> If somebody doesn&#x27;t say something, she&#x27;s gonna turn into another Chichie.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> But Chie-san is a wonderful person... Actually, I&#x27;d be glad to be more like her?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Hmm. Well you&#x27;re already growing into the part, so you might as well act like it, huh.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Growing into...... Hey!? Where are you looking!!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Ahahahahaha!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> But you know, I&#x27;ve gotta keep screwing around to put up with this. This dumbass game training.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> We didn&#x27;t do this last year, so whose bright idea was it this time?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as absurd as you&#x27;re making it out to be.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Really? I mean, the whole Five Traditions made this game center, but it doesn&#x27;t even have rhythm or fighting games? What&#x27;re we doing there then?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That&#x27;s true... All it&#x27;s meant to have are slot machines, roulette tables, and playing cards, right?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> They think we&#x27;re gonna play cards against aradama-chan or something?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> When it comes to cards, it takes concentration to recognize a chance and take it, and good judgment to decide whether to call or draw. That might be what they want us improving...<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> With slot machines, they could improve our perception, and with the others, I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a good reason they have these games for our training.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Now that I think about it... Game training does sound like it could help a lot with being a toji, Kofuki-san.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> But you&#x27;re not gonna kill an aradama-chan with cards.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...Fufu, that&#x27;s very like you.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...This place sure is huge.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I heard they built it specifically for this training, but... It certainly has the right atmosphere.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> For sure.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> That&#x27;s enough talking!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> The explanation of your game training is about to begin.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> First off, forget everything you imagined when you think of the word &quot;game&quot;.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> This is toji training, as true as any other.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Will we be required to play all these games?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> That isn&#x27;t the case.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> You can choose to play games for one person, or more competitive games. So long as you can win points.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> However, I will say this: competitive games will be much more efficient at that.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Those who fail will face extra lessons, continuing their training until they&#x27;ve made up for all the points they couldn&#x27;t collect.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> And afterwards, they&#x27;ll be cleaning this facility.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> (I wonder if they&#x27;re already testing our judgment from the games we choose...)<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> (Cleaning too... I don&#x27;t want to have to take extra lessons... What will Kofuki-san and Yanase-san choose to do...?)<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Yawn... This is taking forever.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> K-Kofuki-san! You shouldn&#x27;t yawn in front of them!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> You realize, it&#x27;s too late to be giving her that advice.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Shichinosato Kofuki...? Is our explanation boring you?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Duh. This&#x27;d put anybody to sleep.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> (Ahh! Kofuki-san! You can&#x27;t talk to them like that...!)<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Maki-san. It seems our explanation is unnecessary, so why don&#x27;t we begin?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I agree, Suzuka. In that case... Everyone, your training starts now!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> At least they didn&#x27;t get mad...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I wouldn&#x27;t lose my temper over something like that, Musumi Kiyoka.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Still, Shichinosato Kofuki. I&#x27;ll be watching you carefully during this training. And whether you&#x27;ll be able to take this seriously.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> She has her eye on you now...<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...Seems like it. Sigh, this couldn&#x27;t be easy.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="2-cheating"></a>2: Cheating!?<a class="hash-link" href="#2-cheating" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> The training&#x27;s started... I&#x27;m already nervous...<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Yes, the mood in here is a little overwhelming.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Let&#x27;s see... Looking around, more went to try the roulette and slot machines than play cards... Right?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Rather than relying on strategy, they probably decided luck based games would be more reliable at gathering points...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> U-Um! What are.... You two going to do?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Since concentration, judgment, and strategy seem important to this training, I think I&#x27;ll go with cards?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> We came here together, so why don&#x27;t we all play together too?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah! Okay! Let&#x27;s all play together!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Pass. Strategy&#x27;s not my thing.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I figured...<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I understand. Then, good luck.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> So, now what...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> What will you do?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Huh? Why&#x27;re you following me?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I won&#x27;t ask you to let me join you. But please, let me hang behind you and watch!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> I don&#x27;t really care, but... Why?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Well... It&#x27;s so tense in here, it&#x27;s making me uncomfortable... I&#x27;d be scared by myself...<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Hmmm. Well, that&#x27;s how you are, I guess.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> But don&#x27;t come crying to me if you end up in makeup lessons, got it?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I won&#x27;t!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Alright, time to get started.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> With the slot machines?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Yep, these look like the easiest way is all. You push here to start, huh...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It&#x27;s my first time seeing a slot machine, but... They spin so fast, don&#x27;t they?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> But that&#x27;s all there is to it; you just push the buttons at the right time. Anyway, let&#x27;s watch the points roll on in.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Ughhhh, I&#x27;m already bored. Kiyoka, you know any tricks to this?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You&#x27;re asking me for help, Kofuki-san!?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Just give me a moment, please! I&#x27;ll do my best to think of something!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> S-Sure. I didn&#x27;t think you were so into this...?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Oh right... I read in a book once about someone who could focus their eyes right, keep track of the slots, and match them up!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Focus your eyes right... It&#x27;s too blurry to see though? They must&#x27;ve had some crazy perceptive vision.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> It might interest you to know that these slot machines have been uniquely modified for this training. Ordinary machines are much slower.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> For training...?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You mean, so it would be harder to follow with your eyes...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> In order to train your kinetic vision, of course.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> That&#x27;s playing dirty.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Will you continue with the slots, or will you give up? It all depends on your judgment.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> The way they&#x27;re acting is pissing me off. I&#x27;ll try using jin&#x27;i, for now.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Just gotta get my okatana, and... Here goes nothing.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Still a little fast, but... I can see it.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> That, should, do it.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That&#x27;s amazing! You got triple 7s, Kofuki-san!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I heard the cheat detector go off, and look who it is.... Shichinosato Kofuki.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Huh? I wasn&#x27;t cheating though? Right?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> R-Right. Kofuki-san is innocent.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Come on... You used jin&#x27;i, didn&#x27;t you? In this training, that&#x27;s forbidden.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Are you serious...?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> So what happens if I cheated? Are you kicking me out?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> What good would kicking you out of training do? No, until this exercise is over, you&#x27;ll be competing with me.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> This is the worst...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Follow me, Shichinosato Kofuki.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> We&#x27;re joining you here.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Oh, that&#x27;s fine. ...Wait, Shidou-san, and Shichinosato-san too? Why are you two together?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> I wouldn&#x27;t be if I could help it.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> You take a seat too, Musumi Kiyoka.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah, I-I&#x27;ll just stay over here! I&#x27;m only here to cheer on Kofuki-san, so...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Then you&#x27;re not training anything. Sit down.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> U-Understood...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> (Why did this have to happen... There&#x27;s no way I can do this all of a sudden...)<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Now then, are you familiar with blackjack?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Nope, not at all. Never heard the name either.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ...I see, that&#x27;s good to know. I&#x27;ll have to explain the rules then.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> For starters, the blackjack you&#x27;ll be playing here has one key difference from ordinary blackjack.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Which is, the players will get to make their decisions while the dealer&#x27;s hole card is shown.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> If I don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s normally like, that doesn&#x27;t mean anything. How&#x27;s that any different from normal?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> It&#x27;s an adjustment so, even if you&#x27;re unfamiliar with the rules, if you&#x27;re astute enough you should be able to win.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Hmm, so it&#x27;s like a handicap for us?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> You can think of it like that.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> As for the goal of the game, you&#x27;re trying to get the cards in your hand to add up to 21.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Huh? Where&#x27;s the fun in that?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> That&#x27;s just how the game works. I&#x27;ll go on.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> In the case that you go over 21, that&#x27;s called going bust, at which point you&#x27;ve lost.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> As you might guess, the 2 through 10 cards are worth the same number value. Face cards are worth 10. The ace is either 1 or 11; you get to pick.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> At the start, the dealer will give you 2 cards. The dealer will also draw 2 for themselves, but only 1 of theirs will be face up.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Why&#x27;d they have to go and make this even more complicated. What&#x27;s wrong with showing all of them?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I told you, didn&#x27;t I? This is the part of the rules we changed. During the games here, you&#x27;ll get to see both of the dealer&#x27;s cards from the beginning.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> While playing blackjack, there are 2 choices the players can make:<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> They can hit, drawing another card. Or they can stand, if they think they can win with their current hand.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> As for more in depth rules...<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Aghh, I get it already! This is boring! There&#x27;s hit, there&#x27;s stand, and you add up to 21. That&#x27;s enough, right?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> If you&#x27;re fine with that. Then, let&#x27;s play blackjack.<br>
--Ten minutes later.</p><p><strong>Dealer:</strong> Hole card, open. The dealer&#x27;s cards reach 20.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> 20, huh... I&#x27;m at 18, and the odds of getting a 3 are... Well, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any helping me here.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> It&#x27;s my loss.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Oh, Mai&#x27;s giving up. What about you, Kiyoka?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I-I&#x27;m also at 18 too, so I...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Will you forfeit too, Musumi Kiyoka?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I-I&#x27;ll hit... A 4... Ahh, I went bust...<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> So Kiyoka&#x27;s busted.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> And I&#x27;m at 19 here. I&#x27;m not gonna win like this, so now what? Think I can get a 2...?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I&#x27;m also at 19, but this is no time to hesitate, Shichinosato Kofuki. This is where your judgment is tested... Hit!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Huhh!? At least think about it first!?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> No matter how much you worry, the cards won&#x27;t change. I drew a 2... That makes 21, blackjack.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> And what will you do?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Like I&#x27;m backing down! I&#x27;ll hit, okay! Gimme a 2! A 2! A 2! 2!<br>
<strong>Dealer:</strong> 5... 24 in total. Shichinosato-sama has gone bust.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="3-kofukis-revenge"></a>3: Kofuki&#x27;s Revenge<a class="hash-link" href="#3-kofukis-revenge" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I&#x27;m at 13, and the dealer has 16... I know I won&#x27;t get a 7 though... I-I give up...<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Kiyoka, you&#x27;re looking pretty pale? You feeling alright?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...Y-Yes. I&#x27;ll be fine... I think.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> You don&#x27;t have to force yourself, okay? Take a break if it&#x27;s too much.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Now, here&#x27;s my problem. The dealer&#x27;s at 16, but I&#x27;ve got 15... I just need anything between a 1 and a 6, come on! Hit!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...10! I went bust again!!?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I have 15 as well... I&#x27;ll stand.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> 15&#x27;s not gonna win you anything though?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Actually, I&#x27;ll be fine with this.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Don&#x27;t blame me when you lose... So, what&#x27;ve you got?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> 18. I&#x27;ll show you my focus and judgment in action once again, Shichinosato Kofuki.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> So long as I get a 3, I&#x27;ll have blackjack. So... Hit.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> 3, and that&#x27;s blackjack.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> What was I supposed to learn from that!? No matter how you spin it, it&#x27;s all luck! If I was lucky too, I&#x27;d have won just like that!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Get a hold of yourself, Shichinosato Kofuki. Think of the purpose of this training.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> I know already! We&#x27;ve gotta get points!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I&#x27;ll take that as a &quot;I don&#x27;t know.&quot;  You should go cool off for a while.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Cool off, my ass! Whose fault do you think it is I&#x27;m getting pissed here!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...Kofuki-san.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Huh?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> This is... It&#x27;s too much for me. It&#x27;s too scary, playing these games together...<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> I mean, you sure are on a losing streak. Well, I&#x27;m not doing any better I guess.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...Kofuki-san, I think you&#x27;re getting too carried away with Shidou-san.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> If you weren&#x27;t always aiming for 21, you&#x27;d win more, I think... The opposite of me...<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...You&#x27;re awesome.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Eh?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> You&#x27;ve got an eye for this stuff!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Y-You think so?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> What else? Did you figure out anything else?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah, umm, let&#x27;s see...... I&#x27;m sorry. I&#x27;m just an amateur, so I&#x27;m not really sure...<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Nah, that&#x27;s more than enough. I think blackjack might be your game, Kiyoka.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> My game...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> U-Um! I think I&#x27;ll give it another try!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Sure? Nobody&#x27;s stopping you.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Okay! And also, I sort of thought of something... Why don&#x27;t we ask Yanase-san to teach us her technique?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> You want me to teach you how I play blackjack?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I don&#x27;t mind helping you one bit, but... I&#x27;m only a beginner, you know?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> But you won with that 15 before.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> That&#x27;s because there&#x27;s a trick to the dealer... I figured out something like a hidden rule.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> A hidden rule?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> In all the time we&#x27;ve been playing, the dealer will never stand when they&#x27;re at 16 or under.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> The lowest I saw it happen was 17.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> They didn&#x27;t?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Yes. That&#x27;s why, it simplifies your chances in that case. If the dealer&#x27;s hand is below 16, you should stand.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> The dealer can&#x27;t stand unless they&#x27;re at 17 or greater. In other words, they must hit for at least another card.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Oh, I get it. It means there&#x27;s a good chance the dealer&#x27;ll go bust.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> The most important factor is the dealer&#x27;s cards.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> The one you&#x27;re facing off against isn&#x27;t Shidou-san or I, but the dealer instead.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> The dealer, huh... Thanks, Mai. This is where our comeback starts, Kiyoka!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> L-Let&#x27;s give it a shot!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> (I&#x27;m at 16, but so&#x27;s the dealer...)<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Oh, this is it, Kiyoka! I&#x27;m gonna stand at 16!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> R-Right! I have 17, so... I&#x27;ll stand!<br>
<strong>Dealer:</strong> The dealer draws an 8... 24 in total. Bust. Congratulations.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Nice! We won!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Yes, we did it!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> (So that&#x27;s why you watch the dealer... This is getting interesting.)<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Congratulations, Shichinosato-san, Musumi-san.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Yeah, it&#x27;s all cause of your help, Mai, Kiyoka!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> But wait, you&#x27;re telling us to watch the dealer, so why&#x27;re you watching our cards too?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I try to watch over everything as I&#x27;m competing. You can start to get an idea of which cards haven&#x27;t been drawn yet like that.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Watch over everything... Ah!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I just realized, but... Isn&#x27;t the way you play blackjack a little like the way you swordfight?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Oh, you might be right about that.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> I could see that.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> That&#x27;s why senpai&#x27;s style is to always go for 21. Cause when she&#x27;s behind, she can always brute force her way ahead.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Was that a compliment?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> U-Um, Kofuki-san! What about me?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Kiyoka? Well... You&#x27;ve got a real sharp eye. And, kinda like Mai, when it&#x27;s make or break, you can tell-<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Our spectrum finders...!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Must be aradama. Your training is temporarily on hold! Get moving!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="4-highly-effective-game-training"></a>4: Highly Effective Game Training<a class="hash-link" href="#4-highly-effective-game-training" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Now this&#x27;s how you blow off stress!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Shichinosato-san! You&#x27;re pushing too far ahead!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> I&#x27;ll be fine! You&#x27;ve got my back, right, Kiyoka!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> R-Right!<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> GAAAAAaaaaa...<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> See? Told you I&#x27;d be fine.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> You mean... Because you knew Musumi-san was there?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Well, it wasn&#x27;t just Kiyoka. I knew you were covering me too.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Kofuki-san&#x27;s paying attention to her surroundings while fighting...!? Is this because of the game training?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Beats me.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> But it felt sort of easier to move around than usual.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> ...I think they might end up doing this game training every year after all.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Shichinosato-san, if it can make you more aware of your surroundings, then there&#x27;s nothing wrong with it.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Why don&#x27;t we take care of the aradama, so we can get back to our training?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Sure! I love you, aradama-chan!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Th-That was exhausting...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Though... Um, Kofuki-san? Could I ask you to continue where you left off before?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Huh?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> When you were comparing how we play blackjack to how we fight!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> You were in the middle of doing me, weren&#x27;t you?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Ahh... Oh yeah, I was. But I&#x27;m done talking about that stuff now.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Come on~.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Now now, that&#x27;s enough talking.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> It&#x27;s time to play blackjack, Shichinosato-san, Musumi-san.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> I&#x27;m all warmed up now. I&#x27;m gonna win it this time!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I&#x27;ll try, but... I wanted to hear the rest-!<br>
Several days later--</p><p><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Can&#x27;t believe we ended up with makeup lessons anyway!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It&#x27;s a real shame... You were so close to beating Shidou-san.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> But in the end, she got 3 blackjacks in a row. She kept bragging about judgment and focus, but it was all about luck in the end!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It&#x27;s hard to deny that...<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> You were close too, you know. You almost made it out of makeup lessons yourself.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I know, but... I&#x27;m still happy about it.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> You like cleaning that much?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That&#x27;s not what I meant. The only reason I was able to get that close in the first place...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It&#x27;s all thanks to you, Kofuki-san!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Huh? I don&#x27;t remember doing anything for you though.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You did! You helped me a lot!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> I seriously don&#x27;t remember anything like that.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Fufu, well, that&#x27;s okay. I remember it just fine!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="5-shidou-maki-joins-the-battle"></a>5: Shidou Maki Joins the Battle<a class="hash-link" href="#5-shidou-maki-joins-the-battle" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Maki:</strong> Everyone, listen closely. This game training is at last reaching its climax.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Now, to finish things, I will personally face against you as a part of your game training. Think of it like a mock battle.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> For the final 2 days, I&#x27;ve picked out the best, &quot;master class&quot; toji, to practice against you.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I won&#x27;t be able to participate in all these master class mock battles, but things have been arranged so I can cross swords with as many of you as possible.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Those who have faith in their skills, I&#x27;d like for you to come test your strength and challenge me to a match.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Of course, a reward has also been prepared for you. Those who are victorious against me will receive these &quot;master chips&quot;, which...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ...What the!? Excuse me, wait just a moment...!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> What&#x27;s the matter, Maki-san?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Suzuka, for some reason, the reward chips have my face on them...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Well look at that. You look wonderful.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Knock it off, Suzuka...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Fufu, I&#x27;m only teasing you. These are what Yume ordered from the supplier. You left her in charge of them, didn&#x27;t you?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> So that&#x27;s what happened. Yume kept complaining she had nothing to do, so I allowed her to design the chips, but... I didn&#x27;t expect her to come up with a prank like this.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> They do receive these chips for defeating you, Maki-san, so I don&#x27;t necessarily think there&#x27;s anything wrong with the design. You might be being too hasty deciding this is one of Yume&#x27;s pranks.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Besides, if you don&#x27;t lose in these mock battles, you won&#x27;t have to give out these chips, will you?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> That&#x27;s true, but... No, while I can&#x27;t help feeling embarrassed, I need to take this seriously.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Sorry for interrupting the explanation. When you defeat me in the mock battles, you&#x27;ll receive one of these master chips. When you collect enough, you can exchange them for your reward.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ...That&#x27;s all I have to tell you! Everyone, work hard to make the best of what&#x27;s left of this training opportunity!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="6-the-amazing-ban-tsugumi"></a>6: The Amazing Ban Tsugumi<a class="hash-link" href="#6-the-amazing-ban-tsugumi" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You want to surprise Tsugumi-san...?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Apparently, she beat Senpai back in the game training.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> &quot;How did you do, Shichinosato-san? You lost? That&#x27;s impressive, Shichinosato-san. How did you manage to lose that?&quot;<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> She won&#x27;t quit rubbing it in!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> She managed to win against Shidou-san!? ...Tsugumi-san&#x27;s amazing, isn&#x27;t she.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> It was just a fluke, a fluke, okay! Ahh, dammit! It&#x27;s pissing me off the way she makes it sound like I&#x27;m an idiot!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> But she&#x27;s known me for a long time, so the moment I start trying something she&#x27;ll figure me out. That&#x27;s why, Kiyoka! I&#x27;m bringing you with me!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Oh, it&#x27;s Shichinosato-san and Musumi-san. What brings you two here?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> You mean you couldn&#x27;t figure that out? We&#x27;re here to play with aradama-chan!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Eh-!?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> That sounds about right. I&#x27;ll get everything ready, so please wait a moment.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> K-Kofuki-san! Does that mean, I&#x27;ll be playing with aradama too!?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> What are you talking about? They&#x27;re my aradama-chan, okay? You&#x27;re here to surprise her.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You never told me what we&#x27;re doing though!?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> It&#x27;s all set for you, Shichinosato-san.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Cool, I&#x27;ll be right there! Well, you gotta think on the fly.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ehhh-!?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> (N-Now I&#x27;m alone with her... How am I supposed to surprise her...)<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Now then, Musumi-san. Shichinosato-san asked you to do something, didn&#x27;t she?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> How did you know!?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> So I was right after all. It was something along the lines of &quot;give me a surprise&quot;, wasn&#x27;t it?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Th-That&#x27;s right... Eh? But how did you figure it out?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I can tell just by watching Shichinosato-san. Yesterday she was full of anger, but she has been grinning to herself all day today.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> At times like this, Shichinosato-san is almost certainly up to some kind of mischief.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Amazing... That&#x27;s amazing, Tsugumi-san! You&#x27;re like a detective!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> It&#x27;s nothing that outstanding, really. Anyway, can I get you something to drink?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Sure! I&#x27;ll have some! And, could I ask you more about Kofuki-san, please!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> That&#x27;s fine. To the extent that I can answer, at least.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Seriously, nothing beats aradama-chan. So, how&#x27;d it go, Kiyoka? Did you get her?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Yes, she got me good. I never expected her to make a face like that. Here are your drinks. This one is for you, Shichinosato-san.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah, oh, thank you.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> (I didn&#x27;t make any face, but I guess she believed it? ...Actually, this drink, it has a weird color to it... What is it exactly...!?!??)<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Bleh, this&#x27;s awful!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Is it? I blended fish oil, dried sardines, oyster, and other marine products into milk. I&#x27;ve had an interest in it lately.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Don&#x27;t put fish in milk! Shit, you made me drink something messed up again!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Again? Does she often get you to drink things like that...? Tsugumi-san is... In a lot of ways, an amazing person, isn&#x27;t she...</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations/edit/docs/Hit_or_Stand__Toji_Style_Game_Training.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_2_ui" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_3DPF"></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"></div></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_35-E thin-scrollbar"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#1-game-training-start" class="table-of-contents__link">1: Game Training, Start</a></li><li><a href="#2-cheating" class="table-of-contents__link">2: Cheating!?</a></li><li><a href="#3-kofukis-revenge" class="table-of-contents__link">3: Kofuki&#39;s Revenge</a></li><li><a href="#4-highly-effective-game-training" class="table-of-contents__link">4: Highly Effective Game Training</a></li><li><a href="#5-shidou-maki-joins-the-battle" class="table-of-contents__link">5: Shidou Maki Joins the Battle</a></li><li><a href="#6-the-amazing-ban-tsugumi" class="table-of-contents__link">6: The Amazing Ban Tsugumi</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Links</div><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://pastebin.com/LdyviZ8Z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Translator anon&#x27;s pastebin<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Site source code<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Built with Docusaurus.</div></div></div></footer></div>
