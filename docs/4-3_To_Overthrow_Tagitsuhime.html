Having fully restored herself, Tagitsuhime no longer has any need for Yukina-- for human assistance.<br><strong>Sana:</strong> She probably never considered... That this was always going to happen.<br><strong>Sana:</strong> Today makes a week since Tagitsuhime opened the gate to the netherworld...<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> In these circumstances, the toji dispatched by Minoseki and Heijou have been a great help. I have to give my thanks to Ema and Iroha.<br><strong>Sana:</strong> Of course.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> How are Etou and the others doing?<br><strong>Sana:</strong> It's been as hard on them as you'd expect. ...Though, since the day after, they've each been working away at aradama suppression missions.<br><strong>Sana:</strong> The investigation team led by Kitora Mirja is doing the same. I'm sure they think it's the least they can do.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> I see...<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Sana. I want to place you in direct supervision of the investigation team. There's something that's concerning me.<br><strong>Sana:</strong> That won't be an issue, but... Who will be in charge of the overall situation...?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> I have someone in mind. She was more stubborn than I imagined. It took great lengths to convince her.<br><strong>Yuzuki:</strong> I don't want to hear that from you of all people, Yukari.<br><strong>Sana:</strong> Yuzuki... Senpai...!?<br><strong>Yuzuki:</strong> ...Could I ask for your cooperation?<br><strong>Sana:</strong> How could I say no! The demon that scared even Minato-senpai is back! The demon! The devil! Yuzuki-senpai!<br><strong>Yuzuki:</strong> W-Was I that bad...?<br><strong>Sana:</strong> But wait, if Yuzuki-senpai is going to be in command of all toji, and I'll be in direct command of the investigation team, what will you be doing, Yukari-senpai...?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> ............My mind is settled. I'm going to bring this to an end. What started twenty years ago.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> It's been a while since we all got to gather round and have some of Mai-chan's sweets, hasn't it! I think I'll go with this one!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Wha- this is chocolate mint flavored!? Mm, it's actually not bad! I think I understand why Hiyori-chan gets so worked up about it!<br><strong>Sayaka/Mai/Ellen:</strong> ............<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Sigh~... Kanami. Do you seriously think we haven't noticed?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Huh? Ahh, you mean this other cookie? Ahaha! So you spotted me secretly grabbing two, huh~!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Please, just stop, Kanami-chan...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> We all understand, Kanamin. Just how hard this is for you.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Even I can tell you're forcing it, Kanami.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Wh-What do you mean, forcing it...? Come on, guys. Am I really acting that weird?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> You don't have to force yourself to smile if you don't want to.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> ...I told Hiyori-chan. That it was too much for her on her own, so I'd carry half of it...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> And still... When it mattered most, I couldn't reach her...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I couldn't keep my promise either... In the end, Hiyori-chan had to deal with everything by herself... I couldn't do anything for her...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Kanami-chan... We all feel the same way... Okay?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Mai... cha...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...She's right. It's the same for us.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> We couldn't... Keep our promise.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I'm sorry, Kanamin. Something this difficult got forced on you...<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Ne...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> That's why... It's okay, Kanami-chan. You don't have to hold it in anymore...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> ...kay...!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> --I'll be fine now. Sorry, that I made everything so difficult.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> It's not a problem at all.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm. You're the one always helping us.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Then, on top of that, there's something I want to ask you.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> If nothing else, I want to get it back... Kogarasumaru. Hiyori-chan's okatana.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> President Maniwa. The gate to the netherworld is only getting wider, isn't it.<br><strong>Sana:</strong> That's right. We might not have much time left...<br><strong>Sana:</strong> By the way, you might have already found out, but Ayanokouji Martial Arts School's President Souraku has returned to command the situation.<br><strong>Sana:</strong> And, because of that, I've been given control of your investigation team for the time being.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Yes, I understand.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> So? What'd you call us here for right after you took charge?<br><strong>Sana:</strong> Right, about that. I thought Kitora and Musumi would be back by now, but...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Um, before that! How is Yui doing now?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> After she injected herself with that ampoule, we haven't heard anything about her... Only that they put her in the hospital...<br><strong>Sana:</strong> Yamashiro is still undergoing medical treatment. From what the doctors said, she made a remarkably fast recovery, but they still haven't approved her release yet.<br><strong>Sana:</strong> That speedy recovery is probably the effects of the ampoule Yuzuki-senp... Commander Souraku came up with.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Excuse me!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> --Eh-!? Yui!? Are you alright now!?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Yep! I'm all better!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> --Or I wish I could tell you that, but the doctors said I still shouldn't be moving around yet... Ahaha...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Wait, hang on, you just came running in here now.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> See... I just wanted to see you all so badly, so I went and ignored what the doctors told me! ...Teehee!<br><strong>Sana:</strong> You're a real idiot, aren't you?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> ...Please, hear me out, President Maniwa! They keep bringing toji in, all these girls hurt fighting aradama, one after another into the hospital!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> When I saw that... I just! I couldn't stay lying around in bed while that went on!<br><strong>Sana:</strong> You were pretty badly injured yourself, you know...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> I'm fine! Please! Let me come back to the investigation team! Let me go on missions!  </p><h2 id="2-kashuu-kiyomitsu-and-the-asakura-family" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>2: Kashuu Kiyomitsu and the Asakura Family</h2><p><strong>Sana:</strong> Let you back into the investigation team? Let you go on missions? You know I'm not going to allow that!<br><strong>Sana:</strong> Yamashiro! Didn't the doctor tell you you still shouldn't be up and about?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> But I can't stand the idea of going back to a hospital bed! If you don't let me come back, I'll follow the investigation team on my own! Stalking is what I'm best at!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> When she puts it like that, it's pretty convincing...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Yui-chan. I understand feeling like you can't just sit by, but you need to listen to what the doctors say...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> I mean, if she's saying she's fine herself, isn't it fine if we let her come with?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> If anything goes wrong, I'll put a stop to it real quick.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Kofuki-chan. You can't go making wild suggestions like...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> No really, Chichie. Think about what kinda person she is. Even if we leave her behind, she's gonna do everything she can to come after us.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Even if we manage to lose her, she's probably just gonna find some other toji to stick to.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Mm... You have a point... Thinking like that, it might be best to have her with us from the start, where we can keep an eye on her so she doesn't push herself too hard.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Kofuki-san! You believe in how much I can help, don't you! Thank you so much!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I think what Fukki believes in is the dangerous side of your personality...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Still, I agree with Fukki. If Yui says she's fine, then I think we should trust her!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Please, I'll ask you too! Let Yui back into the investigation team! We'll all look after her the best we can!<br><strong>Sana:</strong> You'll all look after her? She's not a puppy...<br><strong>Sana:</strong> ...Sigh. Fine. If you're not going to give up on it, I'll allow her back into the investigation team, on one condition.<br><strong>Sana:</strong> If your commanding officer, Kitora, decides you're struggling to continue fighting, you'll withdraw from the battlefield immediately. Meet that condition and you're in. Am I clear?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Yes-! Thank you very much! And thank you too, everyone! I'll do everything I can to make up for the trouble I've caused you!<br><strong>Sana:</strong> It's possible Kitora could decide at any point to deny your place on the team. If that happens, be sure to do as she says.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Wait... Come to think of it, why haven't I seen Mirja-san's gorgeous self or Kiyoka-chan's lovable self?<br><strong>Sana:</strong> That's because, on Kitora's proposal, the two have been taking care of something...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Kitora Mirja and Musumi Kiyoka have made their return.<br><strong>Sana:</strong> Kitora, Musumi, good work you two. You came at just the right time.<br><strong>Sana:</strong> Ah, Shichinosato. This is the reason I called you all here.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Nn...? What's that supposed to mean?<br><strong>Sana:</strong> Kitora and Musumi were sent out to Kamakura to look through an archive of the Sword Administration Bureau's records.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> The Sword Administration Bureau's...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Records...?<br><strong>Sana:</strong> So then, Kitora, Musumi. Did you find anything?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Yes! We found it!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I had arranged for the details to be organized in a separate file and transported here... Do you mind if I speak about our findings for now?<br><strong>Sana:</strong> Go ahead. That'd save us some time.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> In our investigation into the relationship between Kashuu Kiyomtisu and the Asakura lineage, as I suspected, we found a record of an ancestor of Asakura Mihono using Kashuu Kiyomitsu to seal a great aradama in the netherworld.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Though, to be more precise, it is specifically because of its lethal status as a great aradama sealing okatana that it was handed down through the Asakura family for generations, and is currently in Asakura Mihono's possession... Or so I believe.<br><strong>Sana:</strong> Then, to sum it all up...<br><strong>Sana:</strong> Kashuu Kiyomitsu, like Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu, could exist in both the netherworld and our world, and potentially strike a fatal blow to Tagitsuhime.  </p><h2 id="3-commence-operation-1" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>3: Commence Operation!

Have there been any reports about Yomi since then...?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> ...We've still heard nothing.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Is that so...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Yomi-onee-san, where'd she go...<br><strong>Yuzuki:</strong> ...As of today, it's been a week since she was last sighted.

Please let us sortie.<br><strong>Yuzuki:</strong> Sortie... Do you mean, to go after Tagitsuhime?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Yes! At the very least, so we can get Kogarasumaru... Please let me get Hiyori-chan's okatana back!<br><strong>Yuzuki:</strong> I see. And do the other four of you agree on this?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I do!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Please let us go with her.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> The gate to the netherworld is spreading way further, so we can take a look at things while we're out.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Though we might even beat Tagitsuhime while we're at it!<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Nene-!<br><strong>Yuzuki:</strong> ...Fine then. I'll approve your request to sortie. But only provided you do whatever it takes to make it back to us.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> It's no fair that Chidori-onee-san gets to do everything! President Souraku, let us go sortie too! I want to save Yomi-onee-san!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yume has the right idea. So long as the possibility exists, we can't give up on her.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> ...Commander Souraku. We wish to sortie too.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> We have to be there for Yomi-- for our comrade, if at all possible.<br><strong>Yuzuki:</strong> ...I understand. But only on the condition that you suppress any aradama you encounter at ground level.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Yes ma'am! Thank you very much!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> It's like the end of the world here...<br><strong>Mashiko:</strong> If we lose, that's what it really will be.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mai, that's...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Mm, that's where Tagitsuhime is...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Just watch, Hiyori-chan... Kogarasumaru... I'll get it back for sure.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Is everyone ready? In this battle, we need to--<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> No point starting from there now.<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Ne-!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> That's right! I'm sure we all feel the same way!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> You can count on us, Mai.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> We're going to cut open a path for Kanami-chan!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Leave the aradama on the ground to us.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Etou-san. You keep marching straight ahead.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> ...Ah! They're already coming out!<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> SHAAAAA!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> It's our job to deal with the aradama!

The Sword Administration Bureau currently doesn't place that level of importance on Kashuu Kiyomitsu either.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> However, there is something that caught my interest. The other day, when Asakura Mihono suppressed that great aradama, Tagitsuhime suddenly arrived.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> It may be possible that she was sensing the potential threat that Kashuu Kiyomitsu posed.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> But, she left again without doing anything about Kashuu Kiyomitsu.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Don't you think that, if Tagitsuhime was fine with leaving Kashuu Kiyomitsu alone, she decided it couldn't be any danger to her...?<br><strong>Sana:</strong> Hm... At any rate, with just what we know now, we can't say anything conclusively...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> That means there's nothing to do but cut Tagitsuhime and see what happens.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Nice thinking, Kofuki-san! It's so simple it's scary!<br><strong>Sana:</strong> It might be simple, but there's a point to it.<br><strong>Sana:</strong> On top of that, whether or not Kashuu Kiyomitsu has some special effectiveness against Tagitsuhime, if you girls were to sortie, it would make things a whole lot easier for Etou and the rest.<br><strong>Sana:</strong> ...Asakura, what do you think?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> --I want to find out. Whether or not Kiyomitsu can defeat Tagitsuhime.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> And more than that, if Kanami is fighting Tagitsuhime, I can't stay here doing nothing.<br><strong>Sana:</strong> Guess there was no point in asking. In that case, I'll get authorization from Commander Souraku to let you sortie with Etou's unit.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I won't let you down!<br><strong>Yuzuki:</strong> So you were in here, Sana.<br><strong>Sana:</strong> Commander Souraku, I was just about to come get you. Did you need something from me?<br><strong>Yuzuki:</strong> Just now, I sent Yukari along with Etou Kanami and her unit after Tagitsuhime. Along with them, the three elite guards were sent to search after Yomi.<br><strong>Yuzuki:</strong> With the lack of available toji, the defense of the nearby area has gotten thinner. I was wondering, if the investigation team is free at the moment, could I ask them to help--<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Ehh-!? Kanami and them just left!? We're already one step behind-!<br><strong>Yuzuki:</strong> ...? Did something happen?<br><strong>Sana:</strong> I can explain why later, but these girls want to go after Tagitsuhime too.<br><strong>Yuzuki:</strong> Are you serious about this...?<br><strong>Yuzuki:</strong> I understand; I'll approve it. I'll find someone else to handle defense of the area. ...I'm counting on you, Kitora.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I won't let you down!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Umm, hey... Everyone? I just can't stop thinking, I have to apologize to you, to make things right...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> I'm sorry for what I did!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> You all went out of your way to accept me into the team, and... I can't believe I used my okatana against you!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> When I think about it now, I don't know why I acted like that, like it was normal... I can't get it out of my head...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> I'm just really sorry...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yui... We get it! It's all okay now!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Everyone here understands just what sort of effect that brainwashing had. By no means was it your fault.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Yui-chan, nobody blames you for anything.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Yeah, so quit acting all serious. Just go back to your usual self.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> More than anything, I'm just so happy we were able to get you back.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> You all... Thanks...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Still, I'm surprised Mirja let Yui come with us just like that. I was sure she'd put her foot down harder.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Setouchi Chie stated it as, "that way we can keep an eye on her, to stop her from acting recklessly," didn't she? I agree with that point of view.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> However, Yamashiro Yui. If you do behave recklessly, I will order you to retreat on the spot. If I determine you are unable to continue fighting, I will make the same order. Please do not forget that.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> I won't!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> With that settled, let's get moving!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Wait, look at that!<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> GGGGAAAAAAAA!!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Now's a good time to test out my strength! Just watch how much I can do!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> But don't push yourself too hard, okay, Yui!  </p><h2 id="6-kashuu-kiyomitsus-potential-2" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>6: Kashuu Kiyomitsu's Potential (2)</h2><p><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I was worried, after Yui-chan had to stop by the doctor, but...  It looks like we don't have to worry about her now.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Mmhm! I guess modern medicine just couldn't compare to my love for Kiyoka-chan!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I don't really understand what she's saying though...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Yamashiro Yui being able to move without difficulty is possibly an effect of the strengthening drug used by the elite guard.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Yeah! I feel just great! I'm not getting slowed down a bit!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Still, be sure you don't do anything to force yourself. I agree with Mirja: "if you behave recklessly, you'll retreat on the spot."<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> --That's enough talking for now. There's no point in doing this if we don't catch up to Yukari-sama and them before they fight Tagitsuhime.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> That's right!

Anyway, let's go look.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> The Tokyo Station building is in that direction. What could Yomi-san be doing there...?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Besides that...

After each one we defeat, another one comes right out...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> We've been fighting aradama constantly since we left, and it feels like we aren't making any progress... I wonder if we're actually catching up to Yukari-sama and the others...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Our only option now is to make every effort believing that's the case.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> The aradama-chan are getting way too excited.

But, just between you and me, the side effects are seriously messing me up. I can't tell you how bad this thirst is, but it's taking everything I've got to fight it.<br><strong>Hana:</strong> ...Yui, why'd you betray us? Don't you want to see the ideal world Tagitsuhime-sama is creating?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Ideal world? This here is what Tagitsuhime created by opening the gate to the netherworld.<br><strong>Hana:</strong> It's a necessary sacrifice to create her paradise.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> That's just selfish reasoning. When I became a toji, I did it to protect Miku.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> --Ah, Miku, my little sister who's beyond cute, she caught this kind of complicated disease, so ever since she was little, she's been in the hospital.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Miku loves to study, so there's always piles of heavy books in her hospital room. Her dream is to be a schoolteacher someday.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> If Miku were healthy, she could easily make that dream a reality.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> --But her sickness took all her possibilities away from her.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> I might not be able to cure Miku, but so long as I'm a toji, I can afford to get Miku the best treatment she can have. That's why I'm a toji.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> A world that treats Miku... The person I'm fighting to protect! Like a sacrifice! There's no way that could be a paradise!<br><strong>Hana:</strong> What are you losing your nerve for now...!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> If we defeat Tagitsuhime, your brainwashing should be broken too. Then I think you'll understand what I'm telling you.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> I'm not losing my nerve at all. This is what matters most to me. So, until then-- please rest.<br><strong>Hana:</strong> Urgh...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> --Now then. Honestly, I've been fighting pretty hard to keep going, it hurts like crazy all over, and I think I've got a fever. But, I'll power through it somehow!<br><strong>Other:</strong> 1 Lost in Action<br><strong>Sana:</strong> There's nothing abnormal in the vital signs of all the toji sortieing right now.<br><strong>Yuzuki:</strong> No one's been seriously injured then. They're doing well for themselves out there.<br><strong>Sana:</strong> They are. Makes me wish my younger self could've learned a thing or two from them.<br><strong>Sana:</strong> Though, this is all because...<br><strong>Yuzuki:</strong> I know. Juujou Hiyori, 1 toji lost in action... That's a heavy figure.<br><strong>Sana:</strong> We can't let that number grow any higher. We have to get them all the logistical support we can give.<br><strong>Yuzuki:</strong> Still, times will come that we have to prepare ourselves for. For those times...
