What do you think of the name &quot;Mihono&quot;? Written with the kanji for a beautiful flame.<br>
<strong>???:</strong> Mihono... It sounds beautiful. I think it&#x27;s a good name for our daughter. It reminds me of Kanayago-sama...<br>
<strong>???:</strong> Yes. Like Kanayago-sama, goddess of the forge, who created both okatana and tamahagane. I want her to be able to burn as brightly...<br>
<strong>Asakura Yoshizumi:</strong> ...As of today, this is officially bestowed upon you by the Origami family. This is your okatana, Kashuu Kiyomitsu. Accept it mindfully.<br>
<strong>Asakura Mihono:</strong> ...I will!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> So this is... Kiyomitsu. Huh? This okatana, the tip... It&#x27;s gone? ...Did it break off maybe?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> .......<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...I like it! Yeah! It&#x27;s really cute! It has this feeling, like it&#x27;s &quot;THE my okatana!&quot;<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Let&#x27;s do our best together, Kiyomitsu! We&#x27;ll beat up tons of aradama! We&#x27;ll fight for everyone!<br>
<strong>Yoshizumi:</strong> (...Is it fate, I wonder. For that okatana to choose you...)<br>
<strong>Yoshizumi:</strong> (....I&#x27;m sorry, Mihono. For you to lose your parents when you were so young... For one as young as you to have to swing that thing around...)<br>
<strong>Yoshizumi:</strong> (And for your body as well... It&#x27;s all...)<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ??? What&#x27;s wrong, grandpa? You said &quot;parents&quot;...? Were you talking about mom and dad?<br>
<strong>Yoshizumi:</strong> No, it&#x27;s nothing. I just remembered something is all. More importantly, let me see you holding up that okatana now...<br>
<strong>???:</strong> ...hono-chan, Mihono-chan! Are you listening?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Eh...? Uh, this is...?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Mihono-chan? Why are you spacing out before such a big battle? Mmm, you&#x27;re making your onee-san worried.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> She&#x27;s right. This is an important fight, so you need to stay focused, Hono-chan.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Sorry, Chii-nee, Kiyoka. I was just thinking of the past a little... But I&#x27;m fine now, see!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> You sure? Even at your best, you&#x27;re still like a noro magnet. Try keeping it together, Mihocchi!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Hmph! I said I&#x27;m fine! Me and Kiyomitsu are ready to go! After all, we&#x27;re here to protect everyone&#x27;s smiles!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Is that right? Then try not making us even more worried than usual!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Hmm~? Hm~hmm~~? ...Ah! Is that so! You were worried, huh, Fukki!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...Shuttup!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> That&#x27;s enough, you two. It&#x27;s time for us to be in position.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Now, everyone, get in formation! The final operation is about to commence! Thank you for waiting... Head of the family!<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Mm...!<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Ready utsushi! Prepare yourselves! We are now going to suppress <strong>*! Know that this is a battle to secure a tomorrow for humanity!<br></strong>Yukari:<strong> Draw your swords!<br></strong>Mihono:<strong> Did we do it!? It&#x27;s over! Where there&#x27;s a will, there&#x27;s a way, you know!<br></strong>Mihono:<strong> With our investigation team around, we could take on any aradama! We&#x27;re unstoppable!<br></strong>Chie:<strong> Oh, Mihono-chan... There&#x27;s no &quot;investigation team&quot; anymore, remember?<br></strong>Kiyoka:<strong> That&#x27;s right.ã€€We have a real unit name now.<br></strong>Mihono:<strong> Unit name...? Ah, oh yeah... You&#x27;re right!<br></strong>Mihono:<strong> Then... With our (enter player name here) team around, we could beat any aradama!<br></strong>Yukari:<strong> Really now... Asakura Mihono.<br></strong>Mihono:<strong> Ah, yes, head of the family!<br></strong>Yukari:** Don&#x27;t be a fool. This is no time to let your guard down. With an aradama grown to that degree, this battle is far from over.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="2-memories-of-the-battle-yet-to-come-2"></a>2: Memories of the Battle yet to Come (2)<a class="hash-link" href="#2-memories-of-the-battle-yet-to-come-2" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> Why do I have such a bad feeling about this...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> We should have beaten it, but there&#x27;s this awful pressure. It&#x27;s almost like we broke the seal containing its power...<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> C&#x27;mon, you should know by now a bigass aradama like that&#x27;s not gonna die so easy. Ahh, man! I&#x27;m so excited I&#x27;m getting goosebumps!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Listen, Kofuki-chan... We don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s not over yet, so stop talking like that.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> ...Though it does seem like we haven&#x27;t beaten it, right, Mirja?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Yes, it&#x27;s still alive. With my &quot;sight&quot; I can confirm it, <strong>* is still alive.<br></strong>Kofuki:<strong> Hehe, if Mirja says so it must be true. So come on out and play, aradama-chan...!<br></strong>Yukari:<strong> Yes, it&#x27;s as Kitora says. They&#x27;re still alive...<br></strong>Yukari:<strong> ........!<br></strong>Yukari:<strong> Here it comes! All toji, at the ready! Give everything you have to suppress *</strong>!<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Good work, everyone.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah, uh... This time! This time for sure, it&#x27;s over right!?<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> That&#x27;s right. With this, <strong>* can no longer threaten our world...<br></strong>Yukari:<strong> We... ...ven ...f...<br></strong>Mihono:<strong> (Huh? Everyone&#x27;s voices...)<br></strong>Mihono:** (Yukari-sama? Yukari-sama...! Everyone...!?)<br>

<strong>Mihono:</strong> Nn...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Huh? Is this... The dorms? ...My room?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Good morning, Mihono-chan.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Morning, Chii-nee... Nn? Huh...... Chii-nee!?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Mihono-chan? Why are you spacing out like that? Mmm, you&#x27;re making your onee-san worried.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ahh... I get the feeling I&#x27;ve heard that before.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...That dream.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Dream?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Yeah, a dream. I was fighting with a bunch of toji I&#x27;ve never met. You were there, and Yukari-sama was there... I think...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Wait... Did that really happen?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> .......Wait, huhhh!? Is that really you, Chii-nee!? Eh? Eh? Why are you here? I mean, this is my room?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> ...Starting from there, huh?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Yes, without a doubt, this is Minoseki&#x27;s middle school dorms, home to Asakura Mihono.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> As for me, well, I was traveling home. You know my dad lives around here, so... I stop by sometimes.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> And, last night, I spoke to your grandfather at the Asakura Shrine. He said you were staying here now, so I got interested and wanted to see you.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> It&#x27;s been a while, hasn&#x27;t it.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Maybe 5 years since I moved out to Osafune... But I see you still remember me. I&#x27;m glad.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...You haven&#x27;t changed a bit, Chii-nee.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> And of course I remember you! How could I forget! There&#x27;s no way I wouldn&#x27;t remember Chii-nee!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Really? Then, I&#x27;ll believe you. But...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> I never thought you&#x27;d become a toji. Not to mention, you placed 3rd in Minoseki&#x27;s qualifier tournament, didn&#x27;t you? That&#x27;s amazing!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeahhh, welll. I lost hard in the semi-finals. Kanami&#x27;s waaay too strong... This sucks... I&#x27;m just a substitute now...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> (It sounds like losing was a pretty big shock to her?)<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I won&#x27;t get my own hotel room... I won&#x27;t get to go to the onsen... This sucks......<br>
<em>Mihono smacks her face</em></p><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Alright, time to snap out of it!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Oh yeah, Chii-nee! This is your first time at Minoseki, isn&#x27;t it? If you want, I&#x27;ll give you a tour! Until class starts, at least!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="4-minoseki-academy-sightseeing-tour"></a>4: Minoseki Academy Sightseeing Tour<a class="hash-link" href="#4-minoseki-academy-sightseeing-tour" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> I said I&#x27;d give you a tour, but I bet it&#x27;s not all that different from Osafune Girls&#x27; Academy.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Hmm, I&#x27;m not so sure. Don&#x27;t you put a lot more emphasis on sword and scabbard craftsmanship courses here?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Passing down methods of okatana restoration is important, so all the schools in The Five Traditions have some form of swordsmithing course.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> But when it comes to craftsmanship: in making scabbards, binding for the grip, metal fixtures and other mountings, sword knots...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> I think this is the only school with a curriculum that fragmented? There&#x27;s lots of students who aren&#x27;t toji too; that&#x27;s one of Minoseki&#x27;s specialties.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> I mean, at Osafune all the craftsmanship is consolidated into one course where they just teach the standard production methods.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> That&#x27;s why, for toji concerned with the details, they all turn to Minoseki&#x27;s craftsmen for their scabbards, or grips, or guards they want made. You know, like Aoto-kan in Tokyo?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Eh? U-Uh, yeah, I knew that...! Ahaha-!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Did you now?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ......Sorry, I had no clue! Ah!, but basically, that means Osafune is high tech and Minoseki is old tech, right?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Generally speaking, it&#x27;s fine to think of it like that. But when it comes down to it, their objectives with okatana are the same, though their approach differs through technology and tradition.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I get it now~. Chii-nee, thanks for the lesson-! I prostrate myself before thee, hahaaah-!<br>
<strong>???:</strong> No way, miss Osafune. Tradition isn&#x27;t all we&#x27;ve got going for us.<br>
<strong>???:</strong> It&#x27;s true we put a lot of emphasis on it, but we&#x27;re also keeping up with the latest research.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah, Hattori-senpai, good morning! This is Chii-nee, my childhood friend onee-chan. And this is Hattori-senpai, a sword polisher. He works with computers and stuff.<br>
<strong>Hattori:</strong> Thanks for the shaky introduction, Asakura. Nice to meet you, I&#x27;m Tatsuo Hattori.<br>
<strong>Hattori:</strong> For example, we have here a training simulator for teams of toji that&#x27;s been simplified enough for personal use. Want to check it out?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Ah, I&#x27;d like to see that. But is it really okay? I&#x27;m from another school and all.<br>
<strong>Hattori:</strong> Of course; the technology&#x27;s no secret. It&#x27;s this way.<br>
<strong>Hattori:</strong> Though, I called it a simulator, but it&#x27;s not actually virtual reality or anything. We just reproduce battle conditions using computers.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I don&#x27;t believe it, Hattori-senpai&#x27;s acting like a real gentleman! You&#x27;re usually such a weirdo!<br>
<strong>Hattori:</strong> Okay, Asakura. I set the arena to be Minoseki&#x27;s dojo. For your opponent, let&#x27;s go with a suitable group of toji. Should I set the enemy&#x27;s level at its lowest?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Bump it up higher, OK? I wanna show off my leadership skills!<br>
<strong>Hattori:</strong> Oi, oi, you sure?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> I think you should start from the lowest setting, Mihono-chan...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Don&#x27;t worry! Where there&#x27;s a will, there&#x27;s a way, you know!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> See? With a game like this, it&#x27;s surprisingly easy to get a hang of!<br>
<strong>Hattori:</strong> I don&#x27;t think that was a fluke, but... Well, let&#x27;s stop here.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> That&#x27;s right, it&#x27;s best to quit while you&#x27;re ahead.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Hey, what are you two grinning about! That was pure skill, pure skill!<br>
<strong>Hattori:</strong> Sure thing, Asakura. Anyway, Setouchi-san, there&#x27;s one more thing our school is putting research into. The restoration of Akabane swords.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ahh! Akabane swords; those things that have been falling off of aradama, right? The, uh, rusted okatana.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> You&#x27;re not wrong, but... That&#x27;s a shaky explanation.<br>
<strong>Hattori:</strong> Well, being so happy-go-lucky is Asakura&#x27;s charm point after all.<br>
<strong>Hattori:</strong> That said, to us sword polishers, the importance of restoring these Akabane swords is comparable to toji putting themselves in danger fighting aradama.<br>
<strong>Hattori:</strong> With our current level of technology, we still aren&#x27;t allowed to forge tamahagane. At present, the only way for humanity to grow its arsenal of okatana is to acquire and restore these rusted Akabane swords from aradama.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> That&#x27;s right. And as of now, the only schools capable of carrying out recovery on a large scale are Ayanokouji and Minoseki... Ah, look at the time! Mihono-chan, aren&#x27;t you late for class?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah, you&#x27;re right! First period is... Ancient Japanese History... Think I should skip?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Don&#x27;t even think of it. I&#x27;ll be waiting in your room, so study hard, okay?  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="5-off-to-kamakura"></a>5: Off to Kamakura!<a class="hash-link" href="#5-off-to-kamakura" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Yanase Family Butler:</strong> To think that our humble Mai ojou-sama would be representing Minoseki Academy...<br>

<strong>Mihono:</strong> Win.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Eh?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> You better win the whole thing. You beat me after all. And also... Have fun out there.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah. It&#x27;s going to be so fun!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I&#x27;ll be heading to Kamakura with everyone going to cheer you on. But just as your subsitute, alright? Ah, so if you leave me a chance, I&#x27;m gonna take it!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Got it! I&#x27;ll do my best! And when I get back, let&#x27;s have another match! Fighting you in the semi-finals... It was really exciting!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> You were something else... You suddenly started coming at me in ways like no one school I&#x27;ve ever seen! Where&#x27;d you learn to fight like that...!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> If you hadn&#x27;t started losing focus, I really would have been in trouble.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ......Nn!? S-Stop, you&#x27;re making me blush...! Okay, fine! We&#x27;ll have a rematch; that&#x27;s a promise!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah! I promise!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Kanami-chan, it&#x27;s time to leave. The shinkansen is here.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Okay!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> And they&#x27;re gone. Were those two Minoseki&#x27;s representatives this year?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> That&#x27;s right. Etou Kanami-chan and Yanase Mai-chan. Both of them are way stronger than me, seriously.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I&#x27;ve got to get stronger too! And, like I thought, it seems like I&#x27;ve got to work on my concentration...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Mm, do your best. Now... I&#x27;m going to be leaving too. The westbound shinkansen just arrived.<br>
