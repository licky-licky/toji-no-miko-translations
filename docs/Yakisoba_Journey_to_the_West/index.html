During one of those days...</p><p><strong>Yomi:</strong> Shidou-san, all of us have arrived. What was it you wanted to discuss...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Actually, when Suzuka and I were coming back from a mission today, we saw Yukari-sama for the first time in a while.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh-, I wish I&#x27;d been there-. How&#x27;s Yukari-sama doing? What&#x27;d you talk about?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> About that, she seemed busy with something, so we never spoke to her.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> She looked pretty tired too; maybe from the stress building up. I wonder if she&#x27;s doing alright...<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> That is worrying, isn&#x27;t it.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> And, because of that, we thought of gathering us all together to discuss if there wasn&#x27;t anything we could do to help her.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Yume, Yomi, do either of you have any good ideas?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Nnn, then, how about we all go out together? If we go have fun somewhere, it&#x27;ll cheer her up.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Yeah, I&#x27;m sure that would give her a change of pace, but...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Given the current situation, it it may be difficult for her to go outside.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Boo-. I thought that was a good idea too-.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Then, what if we brought her something good to eat to raise her spirits?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Oh, that&#x27;s a fine idea. If we bought her her favorite dish as a present, I&#x27;m sure she would be delighted.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> If we&#x27;re doing that, wouldn&#x27;t it be better if we made it ourselves? We&#x27;ll cook it together and put our hearts in it!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> That sounds like it&#x27;d make her happy. Alright, let&#x27;s put our skills together and cook up something so good it&#x27;ll surprise Yukari-sama!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> No objections here.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Why don&#x27;t we move right to selecting a menu? Do any of you know of which dishes are Yukari-sama&#x27;s favorites?<br>
<strong>Yume/Yomi/Maki:</strong> ........................<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> What does Yukari-sama like to eat, anyway? I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever asked her.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Me neither... Sigh, what do we do now. Just when I thought we were really onto something.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I know! At times like these, why not consult Akane-sama? As sisters who were raised together, she must be aware of her favorites.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I thought that too, and sent Akane-sama a message just now.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Quick thinking, Yomi-san. You always do work fast.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> It seems she&#x27;s replied. According to Akane-sama, she likes light Japanese meals, such as fish simmered in soy sauce.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Alright, light Japanese meals. Then, we&#x27;ll go with the ultimate dish of fish simmered in soy sauce...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Wait a minute, shouldn&#x27;t she be eating tasty Japanese type meals every day? If she&#x27;s eating that and she&#x27;s still not happy, wouldn&#x27;t something else be better?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I see, you do have a point there, Yume. Apart from light Japanese meals, what else has Yukari-sama chosen to eat...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Ah-- Come to think of it, a few times, when we were working as the elite guard, there would be this strange smell like junk food in her office.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> You mean the smell of sauce?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> If that&#x27;s what you mean, I was curious about it myself.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I didn&#x27;t think the smell really had anything to do with Yukari-sama, so I just assumed Yume snuck in to eat croquette or something...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I wouldn&#x27;t do that!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Um, I might have seen it wrong, but once before, I did see Yukari-sama eating instant yakisoba...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> That&#x27;s it! Maybe Yukari-sama likes yakisoba?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Nah, there&#x27;s no way. You think Yukari-sama likes such a low class kind of food?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Though, thinking on it further, for some reason, there were always yakisoba stalls whenever we we would go flower viewing.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I was also confused why, in the storehouse among the emergency rations stockpile, there are lots of cups of instant yakisoba.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh-, then, doesn&#x27;t that settle it? Yukari-sama likes yakisoba!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> True, when you lay it all out like that, it&#x27;s hard to call it a coincidence.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Alright then, starting now, while we work on our usula missions, the Special Defense Team will plan to treat Yukari-sama to the best yakisoba!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="2-lets-go-on-a-search-for-the-ultimate-sauce"></a>2: Let&#x27;s Go On a Search for the Ultimate Sauce!<a class="hash-link" href="#2-lets-go-on-a-search-for-the-ultimate-sauce" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Yume:</strong> Today&#x27;s mission was a piece of cake-. Huh? Are you onee-sans done already too?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Yeah, we finished up quick today, so we were moving ahead with our research into &quot;that&quot;.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Hmm, so, did you find out anything good?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> We found that, while the noodles and other ingredients are important, it seems the most crucial part of yakisoba is the sauce. So, we were looking into finding the ultimate sauce.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> It seems that popular sellers are employing various techniques, like adding fruits and vegetables to their products, or blending various sauces together...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> During our research, we came across one major fact. It looks like a legendary yakisoba shop with the ultimate sauce is out somewhere in Kansai.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Then, if we get that sauce, we can make the ultimate yakisoba!? We should go there right now!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Well, we&#x27;d love to, but... There don&#x27;t seem to be any clear details on which shop it is.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> There&#x27;s a limit to what you can find online or in magazines, so our only option would be to visit the area and ask around. However...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> With our usual stream of missions, traveling to Kansai simply to find a sauce would be difficult.<br>
<strong>Akane:</strong> Oh, I see you&#x27;re all here. This works nicely. I have orders for the four of you to go on an expedition together. Could you please all leave for the Kansai region at once.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> At once? And, all of us!?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Akane-sama, is this really okay? This means, while we do our mission, we can look for the ultimate sauce too, right!<br>
<strong>Akane:</strong> I&#x27;m not sure what you&#x27;re talking about, but, so long as you see your mission through, I won&#x27;t mind if you spend the remaining time however you like. Please have a safe trip.<br>
<strong>Suzuka/Yume/Yomi/Maki:</strong> Yes ma&#x27;am!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> We&#x27;re still only in Shizuoka...? We could&#x27;ve gotten there right away in a bullet train, so why&#x27;d we have to take a regular train that stops everywhere?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Our instructions for this assignment were to make our way towards Kansai, while eliminating aradama frequently appearing in various places along the Tokaido route.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Come to think of it, there was a town famous for their yakisoba in the area near here, wasn&#x27;t there? Why don&#x27;t we stop by for a bit?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> We&#x27;ve finished our mission for today, so that&#x27;s not a bad idea.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> My, with the springy noodles in such rich sauce, this is exquisite.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Right? It&#x27;s no wonder the town is famous for it.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Yeah, it&#x27;s super yummy! With this, do we even have to go all the way to Kansai? Wouldn&#x27;t giving Yukari-sama this yakisoba as a present be enough?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> No, this yakisoba is good and all, but, after coming this far, we should track down the ultimate sauce!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh-, but, we don&#x27;t even know where that shop is supposed to be in Kansai.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> And besides, since we got the chance to come out on an expedition, wouldn&#x27;t it be more fun to find a lot of strong toji in different towns and fight them! Ah, there&#x27;s some local toji onee-sans over there!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Ahh, Yume, wait! Seriously, the moment you take your eyes off her...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I suppose there&#x27;s no helping it. Please leave this to me.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yume, come on over here. I have something good for you.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Something good? Wow, that&#x27;s such a pretty bracelet! You&#x27;re giving it to me, Suzuka-onee-san?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Of course. It was given to me by Akane-sama, but I think it would suit you better. Here, I&#x27;ll put it on for you.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Cool-! Thanks, Suzuka-onee-san. Ah, there&#x27;s another local toji over there. I&#x27;m gonna go ask her for a match!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> What&#x27;s that sound? The bracelet&#x27;s making a weird noise. How do I get it to stop? Suzuka-onee-san, what&#x27;s with this?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Fufu, that bracelet has a device that knows its position with GPS, and, once it reaches a fixed distance away from me, an alarm begins to ring.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Huhh? What&#x27;s with that? That&#x27;s a violation of privacy-. I don&#x27;t want this anymore. I&#x27;ll give it back to you... Wait, huh? It won&#x27;t come off! Why?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> It&#x27;s arranged so that the lock won&#x27;t come undone unless I undo it myself.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> What? Then, that means I have to stay right next to you my whole life?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Once we find the ultimate sauce, I&#x27;ll remove it from you.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> That&#x27;s no fair-!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Suzuka... So heavyhanded. And, somehow, this reminds me of an old story...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I was inspired by Journey to the West. It&#x27;s similar to the band worn around the Monkey King&#x27;s head.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Come to think of it, our assignment now is similar to that trip to retrieve scriptures from India in Journey to the West.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Hey, Yomi-onee-san, Maki-onee-san, stop being impressed with her and help me-!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> There&#x27;s no harm in it. So long as you don&#x27;t stray away from me, it&#x27;s nothing more than a lovely little bracelet.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Boo-.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Haha. Yume is the Monkey King, and Suzuka is Tripitaka; you&#x27;re right, it fits perfectly!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ...Ah-! Wait, then does that make me Pigsy or Sandy!?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> A pig or a kappa... Neither of them sounds great... Pig, kappa. Pig...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Oh, in the time we&#x27;ve spent here, an aradama appeared! Come along, Pigsy, this is no time for your grumbling. We&#x27;re going!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I-I&#x27;m Pigsy!? The pig monster, Pigsy...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I think I lucked out getting to be the Monkey King! Ahaha, let&#x27;s go, Pigsy-onee-san!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Pigsy... Me, of all people...<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Which would mean, I&#x27;m Sandy... Is that right...  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="3-onward-to-the-town-where-you-eat-till-you-drop"></a>3: Onward, to the Town Where You Eat Till You Drop!<a class="hash-link" href="#3-onward-to-the-town-where-you-eat-till-you-drop" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Maki:</strong> I&#x27;m the pig, Pigsy... I ended up the reincarnated pig, Pigsy...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Maki-san? Maki-san!!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Ah-! Sorry about that; I got lost in thought... Where are we now?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> We&#x27;ve arrived in Osaka. As it&#x27;s the heart of the Kansai region, I think it would smart of us to ask around.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Maybe it would be best if we started by splitting up to find information on the ultimate sauce.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Okaaay. Though, I can&#x27;t be away from Suzuka-onee-san right now.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> That&#x27;s true. So then, why don&#x27;t we split into two groups. Yomi-san, could I ask you to pair with Maki-san?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Understood. Then, the two of us will begin asking mainly in the area on the other side of the bridge.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Right.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Sorry for the wait. Did your group find out anything?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I requested the assistance of a local toji, but she hasn&#x27;t yet gotten back to me.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Hm? Yomi-san, I don&#x27;t see Maki-san anywhere. Was she with you?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Shidou-san is on the bench over there...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Urp, sorry. I should have known better...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Maki-onee-san, what happened!? Your belly&#x27;s bulging out!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> As we asked around the various shops, she ate the takoyaki, yakisoba, okonomiyaki; whatever they reccomended her...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Yeah, I couldn&#x27;t refuse, and then...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I know they call this the town where you eat till you drop, but you didn&#x27;t have to really do it! You seriously are Pigsy, Maki-onee-san!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Kh... Still though, maybe you&#x27;re right calling me that, Yume.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Alright, if this is what it comes down to, Shidou Maki&#x27;s going to own up to it and take on the role of Pigsy!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Well now, as soon as you accepted it, your strength came back to you.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> That&#x27;s right. I&#x27;m the man with total destructive power, Pigsy. When I think that, how could overeating slow me down!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Watch me, I&#x27;ll obtain the ultimate sauce that glitters like the holy scriptures, make the finest yakisoba, and defeat the Ox King Yukari-sama!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Weren&#x27;t we going to cheer Yukari-sama up, not beat her up...?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> We were. And also, the Ox King is a villain in Journey to the West who gets in the way of the protagonists goals... I don&#x27;t think that should be Yukari-sama&#x27;s position...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Oh, this call is from the local toji I mentioned. Hello... Really! I see, thank you very much.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Suzuka-onee-san, what&#x27;d they say?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> They went searching around, and seem to have found the stand with the ultimate sauce!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> If we go to this stand, we can get the ultimate sauce for ourselves! So, where is it?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> She sent me a map. Oh my, it&#x27;s right near here. Let&#x27;s go see!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> This should be the yakisoba stand, according to the map. Pardon us.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> There&#x27;s something we want to ask you about. Actually, we want to take some of your shop&#x27;s yakisoba sauce...<br>
<strong>Shopkeeper:</strong> Huh? What&#x27;re you ladies going on about? I&#x27;m not about to hand over my secret sauce just like that.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> We would appreciate it if you found some way to. We&#x27;ve come all the way from Kanto searching for that sauce.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> If not the sauce, would it be possible for you to at least teach us the recipe? We&#x27;ll of course keep it a strict secret.<br>
<strong>Shopkeeper:</strong> I don&#x27;t care where you came out from! There&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m giving up this sauce, and I&#x27;m not telling you the recipe either.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Kh, we found the shop, but it looks like here&#x27;s where the real challenge starts.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> It appears our final adversary wasn&#x27;t the Ox King Yukari-sama, but this shopkeeper all along...<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Should we retreat for now and work out a way to negotiate?<br>
<strong>Shopkeeper:</strong> Damnit, those things showed up again. There&#x27;s a limit to how much you can get in the way of my business!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Mr. Shopkeep, please leave this to us. Now, let&#x27;s get the customers to someplace safe.<br>
<strong>Shopkeeper:</strong> Ah, might you girls be...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> We&#x27;re toji who came all the way out from Kanto to exterminate aradama.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> We&#x27;re super strong too, so just wait and relax! Let&#x27;s go, everyone-!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="4-what-we-found-at-the-end-of-our-journey-was"></a>4: What We Found at the End of Our Journey Was...<a class="hash-link" href="#4-what-we-found-at-the-end-of-our-journey-was" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Aradama:</strong> GUOOOOO...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Didn&#x27;t take an instant to deal with them. Everyone, it&#x27;s safe to come out now.<br>
<strong>Shopkeeper:</strong> You girls were toji, were you? Thanks, for keeping shop and the customers safe.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> No, we only did what was expected of us as toji. What matters most is that the shop and everyone were unharmed.<br>
<strong>Shopkeeper:</strong> Sorry about before. Here, as thanks for what you&#x27;ve done today, would you want to take this?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> This is the ultimate sauce!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Can we? Really!? Nice-! We actually got the sauce!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> At last, we&#x27;ve defeated the Ox King and gotten our hands on the scriptures...<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> We seem to have eliminated all the aradama in this region, so our expedition assignment is finished as well. Let&#x27;s hurry back to the Origami estate.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yomi-san, I cooked the noodles and other ingredients.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> After we season it with the sauce, it will be done.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Now, for the ultimate sauce!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Wow, it smells so good! Yukari-sama&#x27;ll be happy with this for sure.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> That&#x27;s true, it does have a nice smell to it.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Y-Yukari-sama!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> What brings you here?<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> I happened to be passing by, and I heard your voices.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Boo-. I thought we&#x27;d get to surprise her, but she found us out right in the middle of making it.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Isn&#x27;t that still fine, Yume? This means she&#x27;ll be able to savor it right as it&#x27;s freshly cooked.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Yukari-sama, we all made the ultimate yakisoba for you. Please, have a taste.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> For me...? You didn&#x27;t need to go so far. Then, without delay.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Mm... This is... What is this flavor!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Yukari-sama&#x27;s really digging into it. Ah, she&#x27;s already done.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Phew, that was a first rate delicacy. Thank you, honestly, for preparing it for me. Though, I have business to attend to, so, if you&#x27;ll excuse me.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Yukari-sama cheered up a little, didn&#x27;t she!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes, her expression was more relaxed than usual. Her complexion looked slightly better to me as well.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> So you&#x27;re saying our strategy was a total success!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Good work, everyone. This truly turned out for the best.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> So, Suzuka-onee-san, you&#x27;re going to take this bracelet off now, right?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> That&#x27;s right, thank you for all your help, Yume. I&#x27;ll undo the lock for you.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> That&#x27;s a relief-. I&#x27;m a free girl again!<br>
<strong>Akane:</strong> All of you, you did well on your expedition assignment. And, on top of that, thank you for offering Nee-sama a wonderful present.<br>
<strong>Akane:</strong> She seemed happy with the yakisoba, but she was also glad you were able to refresh yourselves on your trip.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> That we were able to refresh ourselves?<br>
<strong>Akane:</strong> Yes. To tell the truth, Nee-sama and I planned this assignment for you four as a change of pace; with how you&#x27;ve been so wrapped up in your daily duties and unable to to leave on expeditions.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Wait, you don&#x27;t mean... You&#x27;re not saying Yukari-sama letting us see her looking down was a part of your plan, are you?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> And giving me that bracelet as well...<br>
<strong>Akane:</strong> Yes, Nee-sama suggested I offer that to you, so that you might enjoy your trip like in Journey to the West.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh-, then, that means she knew from the very beginning that I&#x27;d split up from everyone?<br>
<strong>Akane:</strong> She did. Even I was a little surprised to see your trip play out just how Nee-sama envisioned.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> We went on that trip thinking it was for Yukari-sama&#x27;s sake, but we were in the palm of her hand all along.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> So Yukari-sama wasn&#x27;t the Ox King after all; she was playing the role of the Buddha!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Fufu, just as one would expect of Yukari-sama.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="5-hiyori-and-sanaes-golden-week"></a>5: Hiyori and Sanae&#x27;s Golden Week<a class="hash-link" href="#5-hiyori-and-sanaes-golden-week" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> I thought about maybe going out shopping alone for once, but now that I&#x27;m here, the crowds are as big you&#x27;d expect from the long holiday...<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Huh? Juujou-san!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Iwakura-san. I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d see you here.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> I know. I was here buying kashiwa mochi from the dumpling seller over there.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Kashiwa mochi, huh... That&#x27;s right, it&#x27;s almost Boy&#x27;s Day.	[Boy&#x27;s Day is one of the several holidays during Golden Week. Kashiwa mochi are traditionally served then.]<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Last year, with it being just before the tournament, I didn&#x27;t have any time get kashiwa mochi, so I thought, this year for sure!<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> It happens so fast, doesn&#x27;t it. It&#x27;s nearly been a full year since that tournament.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Yeah, the tournament is as soon as Golden Week is over...<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Come to think of it, do you remember, Juujou-san? We met around this same time last year, by accident just like this.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> We did?<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Remember, we were both tired out from finishing practice, and we happened to bump into each other.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Not much longer before the tournament. It&#x27;s not enough yet... I have to do everything that I can...<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Huh? Juujou-san. I don&#x27;t often run into you around here. Are you on your way back from practice?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> I was.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> I just finished up with my practice too. I was thinking, I might have lost to Juujou-san in the qualifiers, but I want to somehow catch up to her by the main tournament...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> I see... ...Nn? What&#x27;s that long herb you&#x27;re holding...?<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Oh, it&#x27;s an iris. Bathing in a bath with iris petals on Boy&#x27;s Day is supposed to cleanse evil spirits, and they say it&#x27;s good for victory too.	[Boy&#x27;s Day was also known as Iris Day, as it&#x27;s when the irises go in bloom. The kanji for iris can be read as shoubu, for contest, and bathing with iris petals is a tradition for the reasons Sanae listed.]<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> I thought I would use it in the bath at the dorm, as a little superstition for the tournament, but also to pray for everyone&#x27;s safety.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> You should be sure to bathe with them too, Juujou-san, to help ward off evil.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Ahh, that did happen, didn&#x27;t it.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> I&#x27;m glad you remember now. By the way, back then, did you actually bathe with the iris petals?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> I did. The fresh grassy fragrance helped unwind my tension; it was a nice break.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> I see. So long as it helped you out.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Thinking back, a lot of hard things came up this past year, but the power of those irises then might have been part of what helped me stay strong through it.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Fufu.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> That&#x27;s right, for the coming year too, so that everyone can stay safe and do their best as toji, should we buy irises and bring them back?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> A prayer for a safe year, huh. Not a bad idea.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Then, let&#x27;s get right to it and stop by a florist.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Sure. Let&#x27;s buy lots, so we can fill up the dorm&#x27;s bath, before we go back.</p></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="theme-doc-footer-edit-meta-row row"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations/edit/docs/Yakisoba_Journey_to_the_West.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="theme-edit-this-page"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_2_ui" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_13-_"></div></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"></div></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_35-E thin-scrollbar"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#1-what-puts-yukari-sama-in-a-good-mood" class="table-of-contents__link">1: What Puts Yukari-sama in a Good Mood?</a></li><li><a href="#2-lets-go-on-a-search-for-the-ultimate-sauce" class="table-of-contents__link">2: Let&#39;s Go On a Search for the Ultimate Sauce!</a></li><li><a href="#3-onward-to-the-town-where-you-eat-till-you-drop" class="table-of-contents__link">3: Onward, to the Town Where You Eat Till You Drop!</a></li><li><a href="#4-what-we-found-at-the-end-of-our-journey-was" class="table-of-contents__link">4: What We Found at the End of Our Journey Was...</a></li><li><a href="#5-hiyori-and-sanaes-golden-week" class="table-of-contents__link">5: Hiyori and Sanae&#39;s Golden Week</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Links</div><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://pastebin.com/LdyviZ8Z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Translator anon&#x27;s pastebin<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Site source code<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Built with Docusaurus.</div></div></div></footer></div>
