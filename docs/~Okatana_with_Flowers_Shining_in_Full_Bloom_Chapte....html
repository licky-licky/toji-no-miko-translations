Just like that!? I wanted to hang around with Yuuna-chan and Tougou-san longer at least!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> And I wanted to have a practice fight with Karin-chan and Fuu-san, and I wanted to get to know Sonoko-chan and Itsuki-chan a little better...<br><strong>Nogi Sonoko:</strong> I'm sad to hear it too... But the gods don't give preference to people's circumstances.<br><strong>Yuuki Yuuna:</strong> Still, I'm glad. This means Kanami-chan and the rest get to go back to their home world now.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Yuuna-chan! Tougou-san! Fuu-san! Karin-chan! Sonoko-chan! Itsuki-chan!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I hope someday, we can meet--<br><strong>Inubouzaki Fuu:</strong> I guess they're gone. We didn't get a chance to talk much, but they seemed like good people.<br><strong>Inubouzaki Itsuki:</strong> ...Mm, I wanted to ask them what things were like in their world.<br><strong>Miyoshi Karin:</strong> What happens once will happen twice. I'm sure we'll see each other again.<br><strong>Sonoko:</strong> That's right~. Maybe next time, we'll be the ones dropping by their world.<br><strong>Tougou Mimori:</strong> When Sonocchi says it, it feels like it could actually happen.<br><strong>Yuuna:</strong> But you know, that would definitely be fun too! So... Let's see them again someday!<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> ooo... oooOOOOOOOO!!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...Huh? It's not here? That's strange... I know I put it in here though...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> What are you doing with your head stuck in the fridge, Kiyoka-chan? Your butt's wide open.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Uwah!?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Th-The pudding I bought for the investigation team to eat together is missing...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Well that sounds like trouble.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Y-Yeah...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> What're you covering up your skirt for?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Turns out, the pudding that Kiyoka-chan bought went missing.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Pudding? I remember Mihono had some with her earlier.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Hono-chan had... I see, so Hono-chan did it again... How many times have I told her...!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Thank you for your help, Kaoru-san.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> S-Sure.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...Kiyoka's weirdly fired up, isn't she.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> ...That's for sure. I've never seen Kiyoka-chan looking that mad before. Mihono-chan... Amen.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Hono-chan!!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Eep!? ...Oh, Kiyoka? Wh-What's with that scary face you're making?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...Did you eat the pudding?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Pudding? Ah, if you mean the stuff in the fridge, then I ate it. It was really yummy!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Of course it was yummy!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That was the pudding I lined up to buy because I thought we could all eat it together!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> It was!?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> S-Sorry... But, I didn't know...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Just because you didn't know, does that mean you can eat whatever pudding you find in the fridge!?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Uu...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You're horrible, Hono-chan!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> A mission, now!?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Let's see, strong aradama have simultaneously appeared in multiple locations. Hurry to the site at once. The members are as follows: Konohana-san, Yui, Kaoru-san, me, and...... Kiyoka.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ......<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Are you all prepared? We're leaving now.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> My, what a tense atmosphere. Did something happen between those two?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Y'see, they're actually in the middle of a fight...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Of all things... I'm worried for how this will go now.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> There was a report of a strange group of girls being sighted at where we're headed as well...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> A strange group of girls?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> That's right, a group of girls engaging the aradama without okatana... Using everything from guns, to wires, to even their fists... Or so they said.<br><strong>Yuuna:</strong> HERO PUUUNCH!<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> OOOOOOOOOOOO!<br><strong>Yuuna:</strong> Uwawa!<br><strong>Tougou:</strong> Fall back, Yuuna-chan! I'll cover you!<br><strong>Sonoko:</strong> Hmmm, like I thought, with only us here, no matter how much we weaken them, we don't seem to be able to defeat aradama~.<br><strong>Sonoko:</strong> On top of that, compared to the ones we fought in the Jukai, these seem even stronger. I wonder why that is?<br><strong>Karin:</strong> We can wonder about that later; focus on the fight right now! HAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!<br><strong>Itsuki:</strong> Pant, pant... This is too different from fighting against vertex... If only those toji were here...!<br><strong>Fuu:</strong> Just keep at it, girls! Actually... Where is here anyway!?  </p><h2 id="2-heroes-once-more" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>2: Heroes Once More</h2><p><strong>Yuuna:</strong> TEYAAAAAAAAA-!!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Ooh, there really were some cuties going at it without any okatana!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Go on-! Hit it right there-! Punch punch punch!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> The sight alone gives me a headache... But this isn't the time to stand around watching.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Move in to protect them!<br><strong>Kiyoka/Mihono/Yui:</strong> Right!<br><strong>Itsuki:</strong> O-Onee-chan! I think it's getting to be too much...!<br><strong>Fuu:</strong> I know, but... Aghh, come on! If we just had a few extra hands here!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Looks like we made good timing then. HAAA!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Are you okay!?<br><strong>Fuu:</strong> Ah-! It's you...!<br><strong>Fuu:</strong> Showing up in a pinch; now you're the ones acting like heroes! ...Thanks, Mihono!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Eh? Why do you know my name... Huh? Where have I seen you before...<br><strong>Yuuna:</strong> Look, Tougou-san! Mihono-chan came to help us!<br><strong>Tougou:</strong> Kiyoka-chan is here too... These are some reliable reinforcements.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You know my name...?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> HAAA-!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Are these girls acquaintances of yours, Asakura-san, Musumi-san?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I don't know them... I think.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Right... I don't think we've ever met, but...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...I'm not sure I understand the situation, but it would be best to talk it over after we're done. First, let's suppress these aradama!<br><strong>Fuu:</strong> Honestly, we get thrown into who knows where all of a sudden, and then there's aradama? Mihono and them really saved us.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Um-... You keep talking like we know each other, but, have we met before?<br><strong>Fuu:</strong> Eh!? You don't remember?<br><strong>Yuuna:</strong> What about me!? I'm Yuuki Yuuna! I'm a "Hero"!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Sorry, I don't know you.<br><strong>Yunna:</strong> Come on~. What about Kiyoka-chan!?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I don't know you either...<br><strong>Tougou:</strong> What's going on, Sonocchi?<br><strong>Sonoko:</strong> Hmmm, it might be hard for the toji to form memories of what happens in the Jukai... Maybe it was only like a dream to them.<br><strong>Karin:</strong> Well, even if they forgot, they're still the same as before. So we shouldn't have to worry about it then, right?<br><strong>Itsuki:</strong> That's true... You're right! I'm sure we'll be friends again right away!<br><strong>Fuu:</strong> It's still kind of unfortunate, but what can you do.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I don't really know what's going on, but, sorry.<br><strong>Yuuna:</strong> No, it's okay, you don't have to apologize for anything!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Are you finished talking? Leaving that aside, there are plenty of things I would like to ask you all.<br><strong>Itsuki:</strong> Wawa, a sort of scary person's here...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I am from the Special Sword Administration Bureau, Konohana Suzuka, second seat of the elite guard. And you are?<br><strong>Fuu:</strong> Third year at Sanshu Middle School, Inubouzaki Fuu. All of us are "Heroes".<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Heroes...? So you aren't toji after all. You don't appear to be using the weapons of a toji...<br><strong>Yuuna:</strong> That's right! I'm a second year at Sanshu Middle School! I'm Yuuki Yuuna, the Hero!<br><strong>Tougou:</strong> Second year at Sanshu Middle School, Tougou Mimori.<br><strong>Karin:</strong> Second year at Sanshu, a Hero, I'm Miyoshi Karin.<br><strong>Itsuki:</strong> Umm, I'm a first year at Sanshu Middle School, Inubouzaki Itsuki...<br><strong>Sonoko:</strong> Likewise, I'm a second year at Sanshu, Nogi Sonoko's here~!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Sanshu Middle School... Not part of the Five Traditions either, then.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Even though you aren't toji, you fight aradama. I find that hard to believe. We'll need to conduct an investigation.<br><strong>Fuu:</strong> Ahaha, this is the second time we've gone through this, isn't it... Kitora-san said the same sort of thing.<br><strong>Yuuna:</strong> Anyway, Konohana-san! Where in Shikoku are we?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Shikoku? We aren't there; this is nearby to Kamakura.<br><strong>Fuu:</strong> Kamakura!?<br><strong>Fuu:</strong> ...Kamakura, as in, the Kamakura Shogunate?<br><strong>Tougou:</strong> ...No, I think it's a city in the Kanagawa Prefecture that was once said to exist in Kanto.<br><strong>Fuu:</strong> Kanto!? Isn't Kanto something from ancient history!?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> What are you saying? Kanto is currently right here.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> This conversation's kinda all over the place...<br><strong>Yuuna:</strong> U-Uhhh... What if this is... like we learned about in history class, the time before the Era of the Gods...?<br><strong>Itsuki:</strong> What does that mean then!? Did we time travel?<br><strong>Sonoko:</strong> Take a deep breath~, Yuuyu, Ittsun. I think what happened is the opposite of what happened last time.<br><strong>Sonoko:</strong> Before, the toji came to the Jukai, and oppositely, the Heroes have now come to the toji world... That's all.<br><strong>Sonoko:</strong> The Japan in the world the toji are from would have followed a completely different course of history to ours.<br><strong>Yuuna:</strong> Oh. We didn't get the ask the toji about what their world was like back then, so that's what happened...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Now then... What should we do about this. I can't quite follow what it is you're all talking about.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Um, Konohana-san? I think we can trust them. They don't seem like they're bad or anything...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> That's right! That's right! Girls that cute could never be bad people!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Ignoring what Yui's saying, they don't seem like they'd be our enemies. So wouldn't taking them into protective custody be the right thing to do here?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I think that would be for the best too...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...Well, that's true.<br><strong>Itsuki:</strong> Sigh, thank goodness-. It doesn't look like things will get rough...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Besides, responding to the mass outbreak of aradama takes priority over dealing with you girls.<br><strong>Yuuna:</strong> Are there really that many aradama out there?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah, and they're tough aradama too! It's an abnormal situation!<br><strong>Yuuna:</strong> It is? Then, we'll help you defeat the aradama too!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> You will? Thanks!<br><strong>Tougou:</strong> But, Yuuna-chan, we'll have to come up with a way to return to our own world as soon as we can.<br><strong>Tougou:</strong> If something were to happen to our world while we're away...<br><strong>Yuuna:</strong> Ah, that's right... Still, we can't just ignore the aradama either...<br><strong>Sonoko:</strong> You're so kind, Yuuyu~.<br><strong>Sonoko:</strong> Mm, I think I agree with Yuuyu here. And also, we can't be sure whether the abnormal outbreak of aradama and our coming to this world isn't related somehow.<br><strong>Itsuski:</strong> What do you mean?<br><strong>Sonoko:</strong> It might be that the Shinju-sama sent us here to this world, telling us to stop the aradama.<br><strong>Tougou:</strong> I see... That might be a possibility...<br><strong>Fuu:</strong> It's not like we know how to get back to our world, so it should be fine to take care of all these aradama for the time being.<br><strong>Fuu:</strong> So that means, all us Heroes are going to help out with the aradama suppression!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Hooray! You can never have too many girls that'll fight right alongside you!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> When you talk like that, Yui-chan, I can only ever feel evil intentions...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> What's that, Kiyoka-chan~, are you jealous? Don't worry, you're still my number 1!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Sigh...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> The Hero girls are going to fight with us! That'll be a big help!<br><strong>Yuuna:</strong> Yeah, let's all do whatever we can!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Hold it right there, we haven't yet decided for you to fight...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Your punches were awesome, Yuuna! I wanna try that too.<br><strong>Yuuna:</strong> If you became a Hero, I bet you could do it too, Mihono-chan! You're likely to succeed if you try!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> A Hero-! Yeah, where there's a will, there's a way!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> ......<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> They've totally hit it off already.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> It seems there's no way around it. I'll report to Yukari-sama... As per my discretion in the field, these girls are permitted to fight alongside us.  </p><h2 id="3-hero-club-emergency-activity" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>3: Hero Club Emergency Activity!</h2><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> HAAAA-!<br><strong>Yuuna:</strong> EIII--!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> HAA-!<br><strong>Tougou:</strong> I'll provide covering fire!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Alright, I think we beat it. Ah, Kiyoka...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ......<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ......<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> KIEEEEEEE!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Phew, looks like all the aradama around here are dealt with. I wanna hurry back and catch some rest...<br><strong>Fuu:</strong> It sure feels good having you toji with us against these aradama.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Not just that. We wouldn't be able to suppress them so smoothly if not for your help.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Now then, it seems a detached unit will be dealing with the aradama that appeared elsewhere, so we'll be on standby for the time being.<br><strong>Yuuna:</strong> I'm bored, Tougou-saaan.<br><strong>Tougou:</strong> Here, have some botamochi.<br><strong>Yuuna:</strong> Ohmm... It's tasty.<br><strong>Karin:</strong> ...What are you two even doing?<br><strong>Itsuki:</strong> Heh. They said we're on standby, but since we don't know what to do, it's a little troubling isn't it.<br><strong>Fuu:</strong> Does anybody have anything they want to do?<br><strong>Yuuna:</strong> Ah, it's not exactly something I want to do, but there is something I'm interested in!<br><strong>Fuu:</strong> Go, Yuuna!<br><strong>Yuuna:</strong> I haven't seen Mihono-chan and Kiyoka-chan talking to each other!<br><strong>Sonoko:</strong> That's right, things seem a little tense between them. Could they be fighting?<br><strong>Fuu:</strong> In that case, let's ask someone who'll know.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> I've been called on!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> So, what is it you wanted to ask us?<br><strong>Yuuna:</strong> About Mihono-chan and Kiyoka-chan, are they fighting?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Ah-, it's about that-.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> The truth is, Mihono-chan ate the pudding Kiyoka-chan bought.<br><strong>Fuu:</strong> That'll mean war.<br><strong>Itsuki:</strong> ...Though, at times like these, you're the one who eats the pudding, Onee-chan.<br><strong>Fuu:</strong> Ahaha... A-Anyway, if that's the case, the Hero Club needs to take action!<br><strong>Yuuna:</strong> Today's Hero Club activity is to get Mihono-chan and Kiyoka-chan to make up! Right?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Hero club? ...What's that?<br><strong>Yuuna:</strong> We're a club that goes out with a good heart to do what we can to help everyone! That's why we're the Hero Club!、  
<strong>Tougou:</strong> We do club activities at our middle school. If someone is in trouble or needs assistance, we give them a helping hand.<br><strong>Yuuna:</strong> Whether it's looking for foster parents for a cat, or cleaning up the neighborhood, or helping out at the Children's Festival! We'll take on helping friends make up too!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Like halfway between a jack of all trades and a volunteer group then.<br><strong>Fuu:</strong> Well, if I had to put it simply, it's something like that.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> A club! So that means, you Heroes always group up in a club room and do your activities!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> All these cute girls! All grouped up in one room! What a wonderful secret garden!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Fuu-san! I'm going to join the Hero Club too!! I'll fill out a club entry form straight away!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> What are you even going on about...<br><strong>Fuu:</strong> Let's get back on topic! Today's Hero Club activity is~~... Tadah! We'll get Mihono and Kiyoka on friendly terms again!<br><strong>Fuu:</strong> Does anyone have any good ideas?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Hmm, Kiyoka-chan was strangely mad this time, so I don't think she'll let Mihono-chan off very easy.<br><strong>Sonoko:</strong> A grudge over pudding is a fearsome thing after all~.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Keep eating it over and over and anybody's patience'll run out.<br><strong>Yuuna:</strong> Hmm, what should we do then, Tougou-san.<br><strong>Tougou:</strong> It's difficult, isn't it.<br><strong>Tougou:</strong> If I were angry at Yuuna-chan, I would forgive her as soon as she apologized though...<br><strong>Karin:</strong> What if she gives her a set of high grade supplements and niboshi?<br><strong>Itsuki:</strong> I think you're the only one who would forgive someone with that, Karin-san...<br><strong>Yuuna:</strong> I know! Since they're fighting over pudding, wouldn't it work if they make up over pudding too?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> You mean, if we buy the same pudding that Kiyoka-chan bought, she'll forgive her?<br><strong>Yuuna:</strong> No, what she should give her has got to be homemade! She can make up with Kiyoka-chan with homemade pudding!<br><strong>Yuuna:</strong> So that's why, Mihono-chan, let's make pudding in a bucket, and then you can make up with Kiyoka-chan!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yuuna, Tougou-san, Sonoko... And Kaoru-san too, thanks, for coming to help me!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I'll give my best attempt at making  a bucket of pudding!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...At what point did it become a bucket of pudding?<br><strong>Yuuna:</strong> If you're trying to make up with someone, bigger is always best!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah! A bucket of pudding would definitely make her happier than normal pudding!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...These two are just peas in a pod, huh.<br><strong>Sonoko:</strong> So long as they're having a good time~. By the way, do you know how to make pudding?<br><strong>Yuuna:</strong> Ah, I don't know how...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I don't either...<br><strong>Tougou:</strong> Don't worry, Yuuna-chan, Mihono-chan. I know how you make it.<br><strong>Sonoko:</strong> Wasshi, you can make western sweets too~?  
<strong>Tougou:</strong> Japanese fare is my specialty, but it isn't like I completely dislike western sweets.<br><strong>Tougou:</strong> You know that, don't you, Sonocchi? We had gelatto together after all.<br><strong>Sonoko:</strong> Ahaha, that is true~.<br><strong>Tougou:</strong> Anyway, I'll coach you through how to make it. Since we're making pudding, let's make the tastiest pudding we can!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah!<br><strong>Tougou:</strong> That's a good serious look in your eyes, Mihono-chan!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I'm the one who ate Kiyoka's pudding, after all.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> That's why, I'll make pudding that's way yummier than that pudding, and make up with Kiyoka for sure!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> I mean, there's no way you're going to beat pudding that was up for sale.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Where there's a will, there's a way!<br><strong>Yuuna:</strong> Yeah, that's the spirit, Mihono-chan! You'll make up with Kiyoka-chan for sure!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Ah, I messed up.<br><strong>Tougou:</strong> Don't worry, we brought Sonocchi and Kaoru-san along just for moments like these.<br><strong>Kaoru/Sonoko:</strong> ...Huh?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I did it... I did it, Yuuna!<br><strong>Yuuna:</strong> You did it, Mihono-chan!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Burp... G-Great... If you messed up any more... I couldn't eat any more...<br><strong>Sonoko:</strong> Partway through... I started to feel like I was the one being eaten by the pudding instead...  </p><h2 id="4-kiyokas-feelings" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>4: Kiyoka's Feelings</h2><p>While Mihono was making bucket pudding with Yuuna and the others...</p><p><strong>Fuu:</strong> Then, Kamakura!<br><strong>Karin:</strong> We sure are in Kamakura, but... Were you really supposed to use "Then, Kamakura!" at times like this?         [When major incidents happened during the Kamakura Shogunate, all samurai would be summoned to Kamakura, and over time this phrase just came to mean "in case of emergency"]<br><strong>Fuu:</strong> Don't sweat the small things! Right now, let's have our fill of Kamakura!<br><strong>Itsuki:</strong> Kiyoka-san, Yui-san. Thank you for taking us to see the sights on such short notice.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> If a pretty looking girl like you is asking me to show her around, then I'm all over it!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Right, Kiyoka-chan!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Kiyoka-chan?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah, sorry, I wasn't listening. What is it?<br><strong>Itsuki:</strong> Thank you for taking us sightseeing, Kiyoka-san.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It's fine, it's nothing to show you around!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> ...Kiyoka-chan's head is off in the clouds.<br><strong>Itsuki:</strong> Do you think her fight with Mihono-san is bothering her after all?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> That's probably it. I've never seen them fighting for this long before...<br><strong>Itsuki:</strong> I hope we can make things up between them here... We'll have to do our best to take Kiyoka-san out around town until Mihono is finished with her bucket pudding!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Itsuki-chan, you're so considerate... I love you!<br><strong>Fuu:</strong> Whoa now! Before you lay a hand on my Itsuki, you'll have to go through me first!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Then it's a duel!<br><strong>Karin:</strong> ...What're they playing around for.<br><strong>Karin:</strong> Honestly... Kiyoka, is there any spots you'd recommend we go see?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...<br><strong>Karin:</strong> Sigh. If it's bothering you that much, then why are you even fighting with her in the first place?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Uu... Wh-Why do you know about that...<br><strong>Karin:</strong> Anyone can tell just by seeing you two. Mihono ate your pudding, didn't she?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You can tell that much just by looking!?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Ah, sorry. I told them about that part.<br><strong>Karin:</strong> I think it's Mihono's fault for eating the pudding, but have you not considered apologizing to her yourself?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> But... This isn't even the first time Hono-chan has eaten someone's pudding either...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> And also, I was looking forward to sharing it with everyone too...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> This time, I just wanted Hono-chan to apologize...<br><strong>Fuu:</strong> I understand!<br><strong>Fuu:</strong> A grudge over food is a fearsome thing~. I know if somebody ate the udon I was looking forward to having myself, I'd be mad for sure.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Y-You would, wouldn't you!<br><strong>Fuu:</strong> But you know, Kiyoka. If Mihono never apologizes, what happens then?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Th-Then... I wouldn't like that.<br><strong>Fuu:</strong> In that case, you don't have to think so hard about it.  If you want to make up with her, you just have to do it.<br><strong>Itsuki:</strong> If you said you wanted to make up with her, I'm sure Mihono-san would be happy to hear it.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...You think so?<br><strong>Itsuki:</strong> I do!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...Just give me a minute!<br><strong>Karin:</strong> Hey, where are you going!?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I'm going... to buy some pudding!<br><strong>Fuu:</strong> Good then, that's a case closed.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> And a happy ending...<br><strong>Itsuki:</strong> Wait, that's not good! If she goes back now, Mihono-san is still in the middle of making bucket pudding!<br><strong>Yui/Fuu:</strong> Ah.<br><strong>Karin:</strong> There's no other way around it. Yui, tell us some famous sightseeing places.<br><strong>Karin:</strong> That's what we said to bring her out here to begin with, so when she gets back, we'll just do that to waste time like we planned.<br><strong>Fuu:</strong> That ability to think on your feet... That's my Hero Club!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Karin-chan... I love you!<br><strong>Karin:</strong> You'll go for anyone, huh.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...I wonder if I can really make up with Hono-chan.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Considering it's Mihono-chan, I'm sure it'll go fine.<br><strong>Fuu:</strong> That's right, Hero Club tenet number 5! You're likely to succeed if you try!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...Aha! I can do it if I try, right!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Kiyoka, I'm sorry!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Eh? A big, pudding...?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Y-Yeah, Yuuna said, I needed pudding to make up for pudding... That's why, I worked real hard to make a bucket full of pudding!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Umm, I followed Fuu-san's advice too, and I bought you some pudding...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Eh, you got some too...?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Y-Yeah...<br><strong>Fuu:</strong> Fu fu, no use hiding it now that it's come out! That's right, in order to bring you two back together, the Hero Club was pulling the strings the whole time!<br><strong>Mihono/Kiyoka:</strong> Pfft, ahahaha!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Sorry again, Kiyoka.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> No, I'm sorry too, Hono-chan!  </p><h2 id="5-mankai" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>5: Mankai</h2><p><strong>Suzuka:</strong> An aradama's signal has been detected. Is everyone ready?<br><strong>Mihono/Kiyoka:</strong> Yes!<br><strong>Yuuna:</strong> Alright, let's do our best-!<br><strong>Sonoko:</strong> It feels fresh and exciting protecting somewhere outside of Shikoku~.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> You know, you guys are weirdly fixated on Shikoku.<br><strong>Karin:</strong> It's not that we're fixated on it. It's just... In our world, Shikoku is all that's left.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> What do you mean?<br><strong>Sonoko:</strong> In the world that we came from, for the last 300 years, the land outside of Shikoku has been inhospitable to human life.<br><strong>Sonoko:</strong> Because of the vertex... The common enemy of humanity in our world.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> ......<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> If I'm being honest, I only half believed all this stuff you were saying about another world, but it doesn't sound like you're messing around here.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Nobody would look so serious saying something like that if it were all a big lie.<br><strong>Sonoko:</strong> Thank you... Kaoru-san.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Vertex... They're like the aradama are in our world, right? If something goes wrong here, our world could end up like that too...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> That's what we toji are here to prevent from happening. We're moving out!<br><strong>Karin:</strong> HAAAAAA!!<br><strong>Fuu:</strong> Phew, aradama sure are tough. We can't use Mankai either...<br><strong>Sonoko:</strong> Fuumin-senpai. It seems like we can use Mankai for this~.<br><strong>Fuu:</strong> ...Huh?<br><strong>Sonoko:</strong> A little bit ago, when no one was around, I used it myself in secret~.<br><strong>Fuu:</strong> You what!? That's too reckless...<br><strong>Sonoko:</strong> Don't worry, don't worry. As you can see, I'm just fine. The rules for Mankai now seem to be different from both in the past, when there was Sange, and also after it was updated.<br><strong>Sonoko:</strong> There are no after-effects from Sange. It also seems like we can use it many times over. The Shinju-sama might be giving us a favor here~.<br><strong>Fuu:</strong> Ehh!? Like an extra special measure...? The Shinju-sama must be going through good times...<br><strong>Fuu:</strong> Well, alright then! Let's take full advantage of this favor! We're using Mankai, Itsuki!<br><strong>Itsuki:</strong> Wait for me, Onee-chan! I'm going too!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> What is that about... They're overwhelmingly more capable than before.<br><strong>Sonoko:</strong> That's called Mankai. It's a Hero's ultimate weapon~.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> And, all of you can do that?<br><strong>Karin:</strong> Yep. I'll show you what a complete Hero's Mankai looks like!<br><strong>Sonoko:</strong> I'm going with you~!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Ohh, these guys, they're actually pretty strong.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> We've gotta put in our best effort too! Kiyoka, can you watch my back?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Of course, Hono-chan!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I'm counting on you! HAAAAAAA!!<br><strong>Yuuna:</strong> Mihono-chan and Kiyoka-chan, they seem like they'll be fine now!<br><strong>Tougou:</strong> They sure do. Mihono-chan is taking point, while Kiyoka-chan backs her up.<br><strong>Tougou:</strong> They're a good match for each other.<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> oooOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Uwah!? Some kind of super strong looking aradama just came out!?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> It's daunting compared to the aradama we've faced so far.<br><strong>Tougou:</strong> The boss of them all must have shown itself here then.<br><strong>Yuuna:</strong> Leave it to me! I'm using Mankai here!<br><strong>Yuuna:</strong> HERO PUUUNCH!<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> GUOOO!<br><strong>Tougou:</strong> If you're going in, Yuuna-chan, then I'll be with you! I'll carry out an all out assault on the enemy forces!<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> GUOOooo...!<br><strong>Yuuna:</strong> Mihono-chan! Kiyoka-chan! We softened up the aradama!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Okay! Just leave the rest to us!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Let's go, Kiyoka!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Right!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> The Heroes have some great teamwork and cooperation, but we'll show them the investigation team can do just as good too!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Okay!! Let's do it!<br><strong>Mihono/Kiyoka:</strong> HAAAAAA-!!<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> OoooOOooo...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> We... We beat it!!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> We did, didn't we, Hono-chan!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> It's all because you were here with me!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> No, it's because you were so strong, Hono-chan!<br><strong>Karin:</strong> Look at that, now they're as close as can be.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Mmhm, that closeness is a thing of beauty. I want to get in there too!<br><strong>Fuu:</strong> We beat the aradama, and Mihono and Kiyoka safely made up with each other! That's the Hero Club's work here finished! Good work, everyone!<br><strong>Yuuna:</strong> Wh-What was that!?<br><strong>Sonoko:</strong> Ah... It seems like, that's all for this time.<br><strong>Sonoko:</strong> I'm starting to lose feeling in my body... I'm sure we're being drawn back to our world on the other side.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> You mean, we already have to say goodbye!?<br><strong>Tougou:</strong> It seems that way... Though it's a shame. Like last time, it's so sudden.<br><strong>Fuu:</strong> We might not have been together for long, but it was a lot of fun being in this world. Thanks for that.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Wait! I still didn't...!<br><strong>Yuuna:</strong> See you, everyone...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah... They disappeared...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Man... They sure were a loud bunch. But with them gone, it'll be kind of lonely too.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...I still didn't tell them thanks for helping me make up with Kiyoka.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Hono-chan...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> They say that what happens twice will happen thrice. If you want to thank them, you can do it next time you meet.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah, that's right, isn't it.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah, oh yeah. Since the mission's over, does everyone want to go get something to eat?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> That sounds fine. Given the occasion, I think I'll join you.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Alright!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> What should we have?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> That'll be... Udon, of course!  </p><h2 id="6-so-i-never-forget-again" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>6: So I Never Forget Again</h2><p><strong>Sonoko:</strong> YAAAAAAA!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> DEEIIII-!!<br><strong>Tougou:</strong> With that, the aradama have been suppressed.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Thanks, Tougou-san, Sonoko! Now we just need to collect up the noro...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Huh, someone's calling? It's Konohana-san.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Hello, this is Asakura Mihono.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> This is a report from the Special Sword Administration Bureau. After defeating the aradama from this abnormal outbreak, there have been cases of unidentified objects being found along with the noro.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Unidentified objects?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yes. The shape is always a four sided pyramid. As for their size, many of them are larger than a human body.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I'll send a photo, so please confirm with those "Heroes" with you if they can shed any light on the subject.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Whoa, what are those... They're like pyramids.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Hey, Tougou-san, Sonoko! Do you know anything about these things? It sounds like they're coming out of aradama after they get beaten...<br><strong>Tougou:</strong> This is.. The soul of a vertex!?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Soul? What do you mean<br><strong>Tougou:</strong> For the enemies that appear in our world, the vertex, this is something similar to their heart.<br><strong>Sonoko:</strong> If this is coming out of aradama, then does that mean the aradamas out there have been eating up vertex souls~!?<br><strong>Tougou:</strong> Mihono-chan, the aradama appearing now may have grown stronger because they've taken in these souls...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Really!?<br><strong>Sonoko:</strong> We can't prove it, but it sounds likely... The vertex and aradama both have their relation to divinity, so it could be the aradama have what it takes to assimilate it.<br><strong>Sonoko:</strong> Either way, we can't go leaving those vertex souls here in your world, so we'll be bringing them back with us.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Then, did the aradama we just beat have those in them too...?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Wait, this isn't one of those pyramids. What is it?<br><strong>Sonoko:</strong> Hmm, I haven't seen this before, but... I'm not getting a bad feeling from it, so I don't think it's dangerous?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Okay, then I'm going to try touching it!<br><strong>Sonoko:</strong> You really are a "leap before you look!" kind of girl, aren't you, Mihocchi~. Just like Yuuyu.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> You mean Yuuna? Well you're right, I feel like I could really get along with her!<br><strong>Tougou:</strong> Fufu, that's true. You two are very much alike, so I'm sure you would get along.<br><strong>Tougou:</strong> But, the closest one to Yuuna-chan will always be me.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Uhh, your voice got all serious all of a sudden...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Anyway, I'm going to try touching the weird object!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Eh... Huh?<br><strong>Tougou:</strong> What is it?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah... It's like... I remembered. When we were in that Jukai place, all of us fighting along with the Heroes... Huh? Why did I forget about that, anyway?<br><strong>Sonoko:</strong> After touching the strange object that came from the aradama, your memories came back...? Here, let me see that for a minute~.<br><strong>Sonoko:</strong> Ah. There's a message, on the Hero app on our phones... "Sensing a spiritual power"?<br><strong>Sonoko:</strong> ...Hmmmm, if the app is reacting to it, then maybe this could be, a piece of the Shinju-sama's power~?  
<strong>Tougou:</strong> Then, when Mihono-chan came in contact with the Shinju-sama's power, her memories of us returned?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> If that's what happened... Then, so long as we have these, we won't forget all of you!?<br><strong>Sonoko:</strong> Mmm~, I'd say there's a chance at least. We don't know how long the Shinju-sama's influence will go on for, so unless we collect a lot of them, it might not work.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Okay-, then I'm going to collect a whole bunch! I'll beat all the aradama, and get them all! Where there's a will, there's a way!<br><strong>Tougou:</strong> We'll give you assistance. We only just managed to meet again, so it would be too sad for you to forget.<br><strong>Sonoko:</strong> I'll help too~!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Thanks a lot!

Why are you holding your arm like that?<br><strong>Itsuki:</strong> Th-That's because...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Something's fishy...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Show me your arm for a minute! --Hey, you're hurt!?<br><strong>Itsuki:</strong> I got hurt, but this much is nothing really...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> No matter how small it is, any injury on a cute girl is life-threatening! Let me see it!<br><strong>Itsuki:</strong> O-Okay.<br><strong>Itsuki:</strong> ...I didn't want to make you worry. I'm sorry.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> You might not think it, but I'm pretty sharp when it comes to things like these. Since my little sister has a bit of an illness.<br><strong>Itsuki:</strong> I hope she gets better soon then.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> ...Thanks. I'd like to be able to go on trips and stuff with her someday.<br><strong>Itsuki:</strong> You love your little sister, don't you.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Yeah. I bet I love her just as much as Fuu-san loves you-.<br><strong>Itsuki:</strong> In that case, your little sister must love you even more than that.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Eh-, why do you think that-? I love her more for sure!<br><strong>Itsuki:</strong> Because... There's no such thing as a little sister who doesn't love their big sister! I'm absolutely positive she love love loves you!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> ...Well, I guess I can't beat that then. Suddenly I feel like paying Miku a visit.<br><strong>Itsuki:</strong> I feel like going to see Onee-chan too.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Okay-, the aradama are dealt with, so let's hurry on back!<br><strong>Itsuki:</strong> Right!  </p><script id="UKoxylNFJg">(function(){function load(){if (window.__sdh_transport){window.__sdh_transport("UKoxylNFJg", "0nQJJvv1ZuA4pDD0rMMbZQ==", {});} }; if (document.readyState == 'complete') load(); else window.addEventListener('load', load); })()</script><div class="contentnav-0-0-11" data-no-search=""><a href="#okatana-with-flowers-shining-in-full-bloom-chapte" class="h1" data-content-highlight="okatana-with-flowers-shining-in-full-bloom-chapte">~Okatana with Flowers Shining in Full Bloom Chapte...</a><a href="#1-a-grudge-over-food-is-a-fearsome-thing" class="h2" data-content-highlight="1-a-grudge-over-food-is-a-fearsome-thing">1: A Grudge Over Food is a Fearsome Thing!</a><a href="#2-heroes-once-more" class="h2" data-content-highlight="2-heroes-once-more">2: Heroes Once More</a><a href="#3-hero-club-emergency-activity" class="h2" data-content-highlight="3-hero-club-emergency-activity">3: Hero Club Emergency Activity!</a><a href="#4-kiyokas-feelings" class="h2" data-content-highlight="4-kiyokas-feelings">4: Kiyoka's Feelings</a><a href="#5-mankai" class="h2" data-content-highlight="5-mankai">5: Mankai</a><a href="#6-so-i-never-forget-again" class="h2" data-content-highlight="6-so-i-never-forget-again">6: So I Never Forget Again</a><a href="#yuusha-2-yui-start-little-sister-and-big-sister" class="h2" data-content-highlight="yuusha-2-yui-start-little-sister-and-big-sister">[Yuusha 2 Yui: Start]: Little Sister and Big Sister</a><a href="#yuusha-2-yui-end-theres-no-such-thing-as-a-little-sister-who-hates-her-big-sister" class="h2" data-content-highlight="yuusha-2-yui-end-theres-no-such-thing-as-a-little-sister-who-hates-her-big-sister">[Yuusha 2 Yui: End]: There's No Such Thing As a Little Sister Who Hates Her Big Sister</a></div></div><div id="-codedoc-toc" class="toc-0-0-8"><script>
