## 1: To Save Mihono (1)
**Mihono:** ......  
**Chie:** We finally found her...  
**Chie:** Mihono-chan!!  
**Mihono:** ......  
**Kiyoka:** Is that Kanayamahime...?  
**Chie:** When it happened to you, Juujou-san, you were still conscious, weren't you!? So what's going on with Mihono-chan!?  
**Hiyori:** ...This is different from what I went through. Probably closer to what happened with Tagitsuhime and Origami Yukari.  
**Hiyori:** Mihono's consciousness should be trapped up by Kanayamahime...  
**Mihono:** ......  
**Hiyori:** But I don't see Kanayamahime in there either...  
**Kanami:** Then we'll just have to feel her out sword to sword.  
**Kanami:** Give me a response, Kanayamahime!  

## 2: To Save Mihono (2)
**Mihono:** AAAAAAAAAAAGGGHHHHHH!!  
**Hiyori:** Kanami.  
**Kanami:** ...Yeah. That footwork just now was Shingyoto-ryu. But...  
**Mihono:** GAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!  
**Kanami:** I'm not feeling anything from her swordfighting...  
**Mai:** You mean, her body is just moving from memory...?  
**Kofuki:** Oi oi... I've gone up against Mihocchi when she's serious a couple times, but this's on another level.  
**Mihono:** AAAAAAAAAAGGHHHH!!  
**Hiyori:** ...! If she got the name -hime, Kanayamahime has to be past a certain level of intelligence.  
**Kiyoka:** But it doesn't seem like we can get through to her if she just keeps acting wild!  
**Yui:** So then, is Kanayamahime even fully awake...? Or am I being too optimistic?  
**Ellen:** We came here riding on a one in a million hope. That's plenty for us!  
**Nene:** Nene!  
**Kaoru:** Oi, don't go out there! You're gonna get hurt!  
**Kaoru:** Seriously... So, what's the plan?  
**Kanami:** If Kanayamahime hasn't fully woken up, couldn't we get Mihono-chan conscious again?  
**Chie:** Could we still do that!?  
**Hiyori:** It's possible.  
**Hiyori:** But that'll depend on whether Mihono has the willpower left to fight off Kanayamahime...  
**Chie:** ...Mihono-chan wouldn't ever give up.  
**Chie:** If there's a chance, I'll do anything! What do you need from me?  
**Hiyori:** All you can do is keep calling out to her while we wear down Kanayamahime's strength.  
**Hana:** And if Kanayamahime wakes all the way up, then what?  
**Hiyori:** ...If that happens... We just have to try talking Kanayamahime down.  
**Kaoru:** So what, we ask her to give Mihono back? Let's hope she's the understanding type.  
**Ellen:** Don't be like that, Kaoru. If we want to save Mihomiho, all we can do is give this a shot!  

## 3: I'll Save Her (1)
**Mihono:** GAAAAAAGGHHH!  
**Kanami:** HAH!  
**Hiyori:** Gh!!  
**Akira:** ...Good, it's not over yet.  
**Yui:** Boss...  
**Akira:** You here too, Yui?  
**Akira:** And...  
**Hana:** ......  
**Akira:** These're some familiar faces. Though, one of us is...  
**Mihono:** GRAAAAAAAAAGGHHH!  
**Akira:** ...It's just like I told you...  
**Yui:** Boss?  
**Akira:** Forget it. So right now, you're swapping off trying to wear Kanayamahime out...?  
**Akira:** Let me through.  
**Akira:** You're not gonna be able to save Mihono. I can help her, so swap with me.  
**Yui:** You mean you can!? Boss, you can save Mihono-chan...!  
**Akira:** ......Yeah.  
**Akira:** I'll be the one to do it.  
**Yui:** Boss?  
**Hana:** Stop her, Yui!  
**Yui:** Huh?  
**Akira:** --!  
**Ellen:** STOP!  
**Akira:** Gh!?  
**Ellen:** This road's closed, Akira.  
**Akira:** --!?  
**Kaoru:** Don't go... playing cool!  
**Akira:** So it's Ellen and Kaoru first...  
**Yui:** H-Hey, what're you doing!? Boss said she's going to save Mihono-chan...  
**Hana:** Not like that, Yui. That's not... how she's going to save her.  
**Kaoru:** Right?  
**Kaoru:** You're gonna kill Mihono, aren't you?  
**Akira:** ......  
**Ellen:** You're not going to hurt Mihomiho. You'll have to get through us, Akira.  
**Akira:** ...I won't go easy. You better be ready to lose a couple arms!  
**Kaoru:** Same to you!  
**Yui:** But, why, Boss!? You and Mihono-chan were...  
**Akira:** ...That's why.  
**Akira:** That's why... I'll be the one to make this right!!  
**Kaoru:** Let's go, Ellen! Don't let her get Mihono!  
**Ellen:** Yes!  
**Akira:** Come on then!!  

## 4: I'll Save Her (2)
**Chie:** Stop!  
**Ellen:** Chie?  
**Chie:** ...Help us, Inago-san.  
**Kaoru:** The hell are you talking about!? She came here to kill Mihono!  
**Chie:** I said we'd handle it... But all I ever did was talk; I couldn't do anything for her...  
**Chie:** So... talking isn't going to be enough right now! Help us, Inago-san!  
**Akira:** ...Give it up.  
**Akira:** After she's that far gone... we don't have a way to save her either.  
**Akira:** The only way to free her from that is to cut her down and exorcise her.  
**Chie:** You're wrong! Kanayamahime still hasn't fully awakened yet!   
**Chie:** This is... our one and only chance!  
**Akira:** ......  
**Akira:** ......It's not happening.  
**Chie:** Because Makoto ordered you not to?  
**Chie:** But still... Makoto doesn't want this either, does she?  
**Akira:** You think you know Makocchan...?  
**Chie:** I do know her... Because she hasn't changed.  
**Chie:** She's kind hearted, and stubborn...  
**Chie:** Which is why I can tell.  
**Chie:** Makoto would never want to have to make a sacrifice out of Mihono-chan!  
**Chie:** After how much she cried when Miyako gave up her future as a toji... deep down, she'd never want to sacrifice anyone!  
**Akira:** ...You've got that right.  
**Akira:** But then, you get this too, don't you?  
**Akira:** She already made up her mind.  
**Chie:** But...  
**Akira:** Yeah, Makocchan's stubborn as hell. Once she settles on something, she never backs down.  
**Akira:** And I'm right there with her!  
**Mirja:** In that case, we'll offer something that would persuade Hitakami Makoto as well.  
**Akira:** I'm not letting you waste any more time!  
**Mirja:** Grh...  
**Mirja:** ...We'll have Asakura Mihono participate in your research.  
**Akira:** ...What?  
**Chie:** Mirja!?  
**Mirja:** That's the compromise we'll need to make, Setouchi Chie.  
**Mirja:** What do you say?  
**Akira:** ............  
**Mirja:** Then, one more thing. If you're concerned for your future, you should take our side.  
**Akira:** ...What's that supposed to mean?  
**Mirja:** Let's assume you destroy Kanayamahime and Asakura Mihono with her.  
**Mirja:** The general populace and many toji will likely turn a blind eye to Asakura Mihono's sacrifice.  
**Mirja:** However... It's not going to sit right with those who knew her personally.  
**Mirja:** And Asakura Mihono has a way of getting to know people. I think you might be surprised just how many that could be?  
**Akira:** ......  
**Mirja:** If you hope to keep the reputation of tamayori toji stable, you'd be better off having tried to save Asakura Mihono.  
**Mirja:** Am I wrong?  
**Akira:** You sure are a smooth talker.  
**Akira:** ...I've got one condition.  
**Chie:** ...Are you really... helping us?  
**Akira:** It's not like I'm going against what Makocchan said to do.  
**Chie:** Thank you!  
**Akira:** Don't thank me yet!  
**Akira:** If I decide Mihono's past the point of saving, I'm killing her. Got that?

## 5: In the Flames (1)
**???:** (Let's destroy...)  
**Mihono:** Stop it!  
**???:** (Come on? Let's kill...)  
**Mihono:** I don't want to! I don't want to kill anybody!  
**???:** (We'll kill even more humans this time...)  
**Mihono:** STOP ITTTTTTTTTTTTT!!  
**Mihono:** Ugh... Ungh...  
**???:** Please return Atago to me.  
**???:** You refuse? Then I will have Atago returned to me by force.  
**???:** Kgh... You would burn me as well...? Even so...  
**???:** Ugh... Ggh...  
**???:** However much... you would burn me... I will not be stopped...  
**???:** To be with the Atago... That was... the promise made with her...  
**???:** Aghh...!  
**???:** Further... Not much further... until I reach you...  
**???:** Aggghhhhhhhhh!  
**???:** ...gh, ah...  
**???:** ......It seems... you still lack the power to burn me away...  
**???:** And now...  
**???:** I will have her back.  
**???:** Atago...  
**???:** Please open your eyes.  

## 6: In the Flames (2)
**???:** (Let's kill?)  
**???:** (Let's kill all of them who try to stop us?)  
**???:** (I bet it'll feel really good.)  
**Mihono:** I... want to kill them...  
**???:** (Yeah.)  
**???:** (Let's kill a lot.)  
**???:** (Who first? Who's the most special to you?)  
**Mihono:** Chii-nee...  
**???:** (Then, let's kill that person first.)  
**Mihono:** Kill Chii-nee...  
**Mihono:** (Why would I... kill Chii-nee...?)  
**???:** (Because you want to break her.)  
**Mihono:** That's right... I want to break Chii-nee...  
**???:** Your heart is ablaze.  
**Mihono:** ...?  
**???:** Who is this "Chii-nee"?  
**Mihono:** She's the most special to me... so I'll kill her...  
**???:** When a person is killed, they are dead.  
**Mihono:** (...? Well that's... obvious...)  
**???:** Do you wish for her to be dead?  
**Mihono:** I don't...  
**Mihono:** (I don't want her to die... Wait? Then, why am I...?)  
**???:** For how long will you continue to burn, Atago?  
**Mihono:** Burn...?  
**Mihono:** (...Ah.)  
**???:** (Let's kill her.)  
**Mihono:** That's right... I was...  
**Mihono:** (This voice made me start going crazy.)  
**???:** (Let's kill her.)  
**Mihono:** ...I'm not killing her. I'm not... killing anybody.  
**Mihono:** Because I want to keep being a toji!  
**Mihono:** Nn...  
**???:** Have you awakened?  
**Mihono:** Uhhh... Who're you? I'm pretty sure I was... Kanayamahime got to me... and then, I...!  
**???:** gh!!  
**Mihono:** Uwah!?  
**???:** Please be calm, Atago. Kagutsuchi would take advantage of your disordered heart.  
**Mihono:** Kagutsuchi...? Isn't that Kanayamahime...?  
**Kanayamahime:** I am Kanayamahime. And... Kagutsuchi is my true form.  
**Mihono:** Ehh!?  
**Kanayamahime:** Please do not let Kagutsuchi near. Kagutsuchi is destruction itself.  
**Kanayamahime:** It would destroy even you, Atago.  
**Mihono:** W-Wait, hang on a minute!  
**Mihono:** When you keep saying Atago, you mean me?  
**Kanayamahime:** I do.  
**Mihono:** Oh yeah... When you were sealed, we were the Atagos.  
**Mihono:** It's Mihono. I'm Asakura Mihono.  
**Kanayamahime:** Very well, Mihono.  
**Mihono:** (It's weird... I can't see Kanayamahime as my enemy. Because she saved me? Because she's protecting me?)  
**Kanayamahime:** ......?  
**Mihono:** It's like I was dreaming... It kept telling me, to destroy... to kill...  
**Mihono:** So that's... Kagutsuchi?  
**Kanayamahime:** It is.  
**Mihono:** That's... That's not something we can let out in the world. We have to exorcise it somehow...  
**Kanayamahime:** Very well.  
**Kanayamahime:** Let us regain your body. Kagutsuchi's main body is not here.  
**Mihono:** But, how am I supposed to get my body back...? Can you do it for me, Kanayamahime?  
**Mihono:** Ow-- It's hot!?  
**Kanayamahime:** This is what came of seeking power.  
**Mihono:** Seeking power...?  
**Mihono:** I don't get what you mean. Can you explain more?  
**Kanayamahime:** Please defeat Kagutsuchi by your own strength. I cannot give you mine.  

## 7: Do We Trust Her? Or Not?
**Mihono:** Do you hear me?  
**Chie:** Mihono-chan!?  
**Mihono:** I am not.  
**Kanami:** Then, Kanayamahime...?  
**Mihono:** Yes, I am that which you call Kanayamahime.  
**Mirja:** ...Would that mean, things are going as expected?  
**Yui:** If she's talking, then... I guess so?  
**Hiyori:** Kanami...  
**Kanami:** Yeah... This is like with Yukari-sama.  
**Mihono:** Mihono is fighting. Please, save Mihono.  
**Everyone:** Eh!?  
**Mai:** D-Do we trust her...?  
**Mihono:** ...  
**Nene:** Ne! Nene!! Nenenene!  
**Kaoru:** Get away from her, Nene! That's not Mihono...!  
**Nene:** Nee!  
**Mihono:** ...  
**Nene:** Nee?  
**Mihono:** Yes.  
**Ellen:** They're talking... I wonder what they're saying?  
**Kaoru:** Like I'd know.  
**Kaoru:** But... that probably means it's okay to trust her.  
**Nene:** Nenee!  
**Nene:** Ne.  
**Mihono:** Thank you for your aid.  
**Nene:** Nee~!  
**Sayaka:** What should we do?  
**Mihono:** What you have done will not be enough. Please weaken her even further.  
**Kofuki:** Wait, that's it!?  
**Mihono:** ......  
**Akira:** So she says what she wants and she's gone again.  
**Akira:** Still, this isn't enough? No more playing touch and go then. If it kills her, you asked for it!!  
**Kanami:** I'll go all out... If that's what'll save Mihono-chan!  
**Mihono:** ......!  
**Mirja:** Aradama!? Did they come in response to Kanayamahime!?  
**Mai:** ...What should we do?  
**Mirja:** ......  
**Mirja:** Investigation team! Suppress the aradama! We can handle this!  
**Kofuki:** Who do you think you're talking to? No shit I'll...  
**Chie:** --!!  
**Kofuki:** [whistle~]  
**Chie:** I'm not letting them stop everyone now.  
**Chie:** COME ON!!

## 8: An Answer

**Mihono:** It's hard getting close, cause of this fire...!  
**Kanayamahime:** Please withstand it a little longer.  
**Mihono:** A little longer...?  
**Kanayamahime:** Yes.  
**Mihono:** If you're sure, then I'll do what I can, but...  
**Mihono:** ...Wait? Is it me, or is it getting less hot?  
**Kanayamahime:** The miko are beginning to have an effect. Let's wait a little longer.  
**Mihono:** The miko?  
**Kanaymahime:** The miko outside, who are trying to save you. I asked the miko for their aid.  
**Mihono:** They're here... But... why?  
**Kanaymahime:** What is it you want to know?  
**Mihono:** Why are you helping me, Kanayamahime?  
**Kanayamahime:** I have not done anything.  
**Kanayamahime:** If I helped you as you asked, Kagutsuchi would grow stronger.  
**Mihono:** ...Huh?  
**Kanayamahime:** My power is Kagutsuchi's power. It would consume you.  
**Mihono:** ......  
**Mihono:** Why... are you worried about me?  
**Mihono:** Because of my ancestors, you ended up being...  
**Kanayamahime:** The Atago gave me a place to belong.  
**Kanayamahime:** The Atago bloodline is where I belong. That is where I have slept.  
**Mihono:** ...  
**Kanayamahime:** I wish to be with you.  
**Mihono:** With me...  
**Mihono:** You just want to be together with me...?  
**Kanayamahime:** I do.  
**Mihono:** And, that's why you gave me your power...  
**Kanayamahime:** Yes.  
**Kanayamahime:** Yet, I cannot stand against Kagutsuchi. My power is Kagutsuchi's power.  
**Mihono:** ............  
**Mihono:** So you just wanted to be together with me...  
**Mihono:** And that dream... and me losing control... None of that was stuff you wanted to happen...  
**Kanayamahaime:** You were the one who sought for it, Mihono.  
**Mihono:** !?  
**Mihono:** ...I did?  
**Mihono:** That's what... I wanted?  
**Kanayamahime:** You did.  
**Kanayamahime:** You wished for power.  
**Mihono:** ...Yeah, you're right that I kept asking for more from Kashuu Kiyomitsu.  
**Mihono:** I thought, if I had Kashuu Kiyomitsu's power... if I had your power...  
**Mihono:** ...So that's why.  
**Mihono:** You were just answering what I wanted.  
**Mihono:** Cause I was weak and kept choosing the easy way... I just figured I'd use your power, and stopped improving on my own...  
**Kanayamahime:** I do not mind.  
**Mihono:** ...I can't do that.  
**Kanayamahime:** You won't?  
**Mihono:** I mean, you just want to be together with me, right, Kanayamahime?  
**Mihono:** So then, all you have to do is be with me! You don't have to do anything if I'm being selfish!  
**Kanayamahime:** What do you mean?  
**Mihono:** It shouldn't have to do with whether I want something or not...  
**Mihono:** Let's just be together!  
**Mihono:** If you don't like something, say no! If you want to help me, then help me!  
**Mihono:** You should be the one to decide, not me!  
**Mihono:** We should be more like that!  
**Kanayamahime:** But, my promise with the Atago...  
**Mihono:** What happened in the past doesn't matter!  
**Mihono:** Cause this is just about you and me! We're just talking about how the two of us should be together!  
**Mihono:** And I think... we should be equals!  
**Kanayamahime:** Equals...  
**Mihono:** The way things are... all I'm doing is using you. I'll definitely end up depending too much on you again.  
**Mihono:** And I'd hate to do that!  
**Mihono:** So let's just be together in our own way!  
**Mihono:** So what do you think, Kanayamahime? Are you okay with that!?  
**Kanayamahime:** I think, so long as I can be with you, Mihono, it would be fine.  
**Mihono:** That's not what I mean! Don't you have anything you want besides that?  
**Kanayamahime:** This is difficult.  
**Kanayamahime:** ...Ah.  
**Mihono:** Did you think of something?  
**Kanayamahime:** I wish to save you. That is what I desire.  
**Kanayamahime:** Which is why I will oppose Kagutsuchi.  
**Mihono:** Okay!  
**Kanayamahime:** ......This is fine with you, Mihono?  
**Kanayamahime:** Very well.  
**Kanayamahime:** I will follow my own desire and destroy Kagutsuchi.  
**Mihono:** Sure! Help me out, Kanayamahime!   

## 9: To Exorcise Kagutsuchi (1)
**Mihono:** ......  
**Chie:** She stopped... moving?  
**Chie:** Mihono-chan...?  
**Kiyoka:** Hono-chan! Can you hear us!?  
**Yui:** Come back to us, Mihono-chan!  
**Hana:** Mihono!   
**Kofuki:** If you don't get your ass back here, I'm not messing around with you anymore, Mihocchi!  
**Mirja:** ......  
**Akira:** You're sure keeping your cool about this.  
**Mirja:** That's my responsibility.  
**Mirja:** If the worst should happen... Please handle the rest.  
**Akira:** ...Yeah.  
**Mihono?:** A...gh...  
**Everyone:** --!  
**Ellen:** ...Want to make a bet, Kaoru?  
**Kaoru:** If you're okay with letting me bet she'll be fine.  
**Ellen:** Oh, then it's not much of a bet.  
**Kaoru:** Figured as much.  
**Kaoru:** All the bets are off, so you'd better come back, Mihono!  
**Mihono?:** Ugh... ghh...  
**Sayaka:** Mai...  
**Mai:** It's alright, Sayaka-chan.  
**Mai:** I'm sure... she'll be smiling just like usual.  
**Sayaka:** ...Mm.  
**Sayaka:** Mihono...!  
**Mihono?:** ...  
**Kanami:** Mihono-chan'll definitely beat Kanayamahime!  
**Hiyori:** That's right! Everyone's waiting here for you to come back!  
**Kanami:** So... We believe in you, Mihono-chan!!  
**Mihono:** ............  
**Mihono:** Ah-- it's everybody.  
**Everyone:** ......  
**Kofuki:** "Ah-- it's everybody"; is that all you've got to say, Dumbacchi!?  
**Mihono:** Dumbacchi!?  
**Chie:** It's you, isn't it, Mihono-chan?  
**Chie:** Thank goodness...! Mihono-chan... Mihono-chan...!  
**Mihono:** Sorry for making you worry, Chii-nee.  
**Kiyoka:** Really, Hono-chan!  
**Chie:** Chie-san's not the only one you made worry!  
**Mihono:** I know, Kiyoka.  
**Mihono:** ...Thanks.  
**Yui:** ......  
**Hana:** Yui?  
**Yui:** It's just, it's too precious...  
**Yui:** I just love the investigation team so much...  
**Hana:** ...Sure.  
**Hana:** It's just not the team without Mihono.  

## 10: To Exorcise Kagutsuchi (2)
**Mirja:** Asakura Mihono, is it safe to assume the issue with Kanayamahime has been settled?  
**Mihono:** Yeah, Kanayamahime's fine now. Right, Kanayamahime?  
**Kanayamahime:** ...  
**Hiyori:** --!?  
**Hiyori:** ...That's Kanayamahime?  
**Kanami:** ...?  
**Kanami:** She's like Mihono-chan before, but different...?  
**Hiyori:** What are you talking about?  
**Kanami:** Mihono-chan before felt a lot more aggressive, but Kanayamahime's a lot calmer...  
**Akira:** What's that got to do with anything!  
**Mihono:** Stop!!  
**Akira:** Get outta the way! This isn't gonna end until we kill her!  
**Mihono:** But, Kanayamahime isn't the bad one!  
**Akira:** Who do you think you're fooling!?  
**Akira:** Killing her's the only way to stop anybody else from getting hurt!!  
**Mihono:** But Kanayamahime wasn't doing any of the bad stuff; that was Kagutsuchi!!  
**Akira:** I've gotta make this right! And the only way to do that's by killing and exorcising Kanayamahime!!  
**Akira:** That's what this comes down to at this point!  
**Mihono:** I don't care about any of that!!  
**Akira:** What're you, stupid!!  
**Mihono:** I am stupid-!!  
**Akira:** ...Whatever happens, you asked for it.  
**Mihono:** I'm not letting you kill her. Kanayamahime, get behind me.  
**Kanayamahime:** ...I will not. Please step out of the way, Mihono.  
**Mihono:** Kanayamahime?  
**Kanayamahime:** I will follow my own wishes and fight this miko.  
**Akira:** Fine by me! Nobody else has to get involved!  
**Mihono:** You can't either, Kanayamahime! We're absolutely going to need Akira-san's help for beating Kagutsuchi!  
**Mirja:** Asakura Mihono, what is Kagutsuchi...? And, we'll need to defeat it?  
**Mihono:** Kagutsuchi's Kanayamahime's main body.  
**Mihono:** Kanayamahime just wants to be with me.  
**Mihono:** Kanayamahime's not the one who wants to mess everything up; that's Kagutsuchi!  
**Mihono:** Isn't that right, Kanayamahime?  
**Kanayamahime:** It is.  
**Kiyoka:** She is a great aradama... isn't she? She's kind of, awfully well behaved...  
**Yui:** Like she's, totally hooked on Mihono-chan...?  
**Hana:** Hooked on her? That's a real Yui way of putting it.  
**Hana:** Though... Yeah. She doesn't look like she wants to hurt anybody.  
**Mihono:** If we beat Kagutsuchi, Kanayamahime shouldn't end up hurting anybody anymore!  
**Kaoru:** What, like Nene?  
**Mihono:** Like that!  
**Kaoru:** Then, I don't see why not. If she's not dangerous, it'd be too much work fighting her.  
**Ellen:** For sure! Friendly aradama are always welcome!  
**Hiyori:** It turned out just like you said, in the end.  
**Kanami:** Eh?  
**Hiyori:** Remember what you said in Mihono's room?  
**Hiyori:** How, we should try getting along with a great aradama.  
**Kanami:** I was only thinking it might worth trying... Mihono-chan's the one who went through all this to get here.  
**Kofuki:** Getting along with an aradama? We're doing this again...?  
**Kiyoka:** There's no stopping Hono-chan with that.  
**Hana:** Mihono's really rubbing off on you guys.  
**Hana:** ...Though I guess it's the same for me.  
**Akira:** Aghh... That's not the issue here.  
**Akira:** I'm suppressing Kanayamahime. That's not changing.  
**Akira:** If I've gotta smack you all down getting to her, don't think I won't.  
**Mihono:** That's what I'm saying though; instead of Kanayamahime, let's work together to beat Kagutsuchi!  
**Akira:** Not happening.  
**Akira:** This one's gotta go. ......Oi, we're picking up where we left off. You good to go?  
**Kanayamahime:** I am not.  
**Akira:** Hahh?  
**Kanayamahime:** There would be no reason for it.  
**Kanayamahime:** Kagutsuchi and myself are one. If Kagutsuchi were to be exorcised, I would be gone as well.  
**Mihono:** .........Huh?  
**Mihono:** W-Wait, you didn't say anything about that! Weren't we going to fight Kagutsuchi cause you wanted to be together with me!?  
**Kanayamahime:** That's not correct.  
**Kanayamahime:** I had two desires. Both of them contradicted the other. So I chose my desire to protect you.  
**Mihono:** But, we can't do that...  
**Mihono:** Isn't there something else we can do?  
**Mihono:** Some way to beat just Kagutsuchi, and you'll still be here?  
**Kanayamahime:** There is no such thing.  
**Kanayamahime:** Only one of my desires can be granted.  
**Kanami:** Kanayamahime's kindhearted, isn't she...  
**Kanami:** I think I know how she feels... wanting to be with Mihono-chan.  
**Mihono:** ...See?  
**Akira:** Tch, this is all out of whack. If we beat Kagutsuchi, you're gone too, right?  
**Kanayamahime:** Yes.  
**Akira:** ...Then fine.  
**Akira:** I'll just have to tear Kagutsuchi apart.

## 11: The Final Battle, Kagutsuchi (1)

**Mirja:** So then, Asakura Mihono. How are we meant to defeat Kagutsuchi?  
**Mihono:** Well that's easy!  
**Mihono:** It's easy... Uh, Kanayamahime?  
**Kanayamahime:** For that, we would... Ah!?  
**Mihono:** What's wrong?  
**Kanayamahime:** Kagutsuchi is watching us here.  
**Hiyori:** You know where Kagutsuchi is?  
**Kanayamahime:** I do.  
**Mirja:** So long as we have Kanayamahime navigating for us, we should be able to reach it then.  
**Mihono:** Take us there, Kanayamahime!  
**Kanayamahime:** Kagutsuchi lies beyond here.  
**Mihono:** Eh? Where is it? I can't see... Huh?  
**Mihono:** Wait, where'd everybody go!?  
**Hiyori:** Looks like we lost them coming here...  
**Hiyori:** (Or... it's possible that she was trying to split us up from the start...)  
**Kanayamahime:** Should we return to the world, Mihono?  
**Mihono:** If we go back...  
**Hiyori:** (Guess I'm overthinking it.)  
**Kanami:** Hiyori-chan?  
**Hiyori:** It's nothing; forget it.  
**Hiyori:** Mihono, there's no need for us to go back. Either way, we should be able to fight it with the 5 of us here.  
**Hiyori:** Isn't that right?  
**Kanayamahime:** It is.  
**Mihono:** So we won't be fighting with everybody...  
**Akira:** Feeling scared?  
**Mihono:** ...I'm a little bit scared.  
**Mihono:** I'd feel better if everybody else was here too... I'm not sure if we can win if it's just us...  
**Kanami:** We should be fine!  
**Mihono:** Kanami...  
**Kanami:** We're all pretty strong. If it's us 5... We'll beat it for sure!  
**Mihono:** ...Yeah, we'll beat Kagutsuchi together.  
**Mihono:** Let's go! Where there's a will, there's a way!  

## 12: The Final Battle, Kagutsuchi (2)
**Mihono:** Where is this...?  
**Mihono:** Is that my home that's burning...!?  
**Kanami:** Calm down, Mihono-chan! Kagutsuchi's just making it look that way!  
**Kanami:** More importantly... Look at that!  
**Mihono:** That's, Kagutsuchi...!  
**Akira:** It's freakin' huge...  
**Hiyori:** Losing your nerve?  
**Akira:** Other way around! Haha! This's the best!  
**Akira:** Just the kind of fight that comes once in a lifetime!  
**Akira:** ORRRAAAAAAAAAAAA!!  
**Hiyori:** Hey! She's off on her own... Kanami! I'm going to back her up!  
**Kanami:** Okay!  
**Kanami:** Mihono-chan! Let's go in too!  
**Mihono:** Alright! Kanayamahime!  
**Kanayamahime:** ......  
**Mihono:** ...Kanayamahime?  
**Kanayamahime:** Please move away from me.  
**Mihono:** Huh?  
**Kanami:** Kagutsuchi's trying to get Kanayamahime!  
**Kanayamahime:** Kagutsuchi seems to be trying to consume me and complete its strength.  
**Mihono:** I'm not letting it!  
**Mihono:** You're staying with me, not with Kagutsuchi!  
**Kanayamahime:** Mihono... Thank you.  
**Kanami:** You'll be fine if you're with Mihono-chan, Kanayamahime.  
**Mihono:** Yeah! I'm not letting Kagutsuchi or anybody have you!  
**Akira:** [pant... pant... pant...]  
**Mihono:** YAAAAAAAAAAAHH!!  
**Kanami:** We'll help, Mihono-chan! Hiyori-chan!  
**Hiyori:** You don't even have to ask!  
**Kanami:** ...It's attacking! Be on guard...  
**Akira:** UAAAAAAAAAAGHHH!  
**Hiyori:** ...Gh, everyone alright?  
**Kanami:** Yeah! I can keep on fighting!  
**Mihono:** I think I can manage too! But, Akira-san!?  
**Akira:** You don't gotta worry about me!  
**Akira:** [pant... pant... pant...]  
**Akira:** ...You've gotten tough, Mihono. Compared to that... Ggh...  
**Akira:** (I can't go on much more...)  
**Akira:** (Ever since fighting the special defense team, I've been leaning nonstop on this suit...)  
**Akira:** But hey, there'd be no point coming this far if I just up and backed off now!  
**Akira:** MIHONO!!  
**Mihono:** Y-Yeah!?  
**Akira:** I'm gonna keep the pressure on that big thing! So you'd better hurry up and exorcise the hell out of it!  
**Akira:** ORRRAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!  
**Akira:** Gagh...! Like that'll, do, ANYTHIIIIIIIIIIINNGG!!  
**Hiyori:** Idiot! You're at your limit, aren't you!?  
**Akira:** You don't get to tell me where my limit's at!  
**Akira:** This's the only way... I know how to fight!  
**Akira:** Just push up and put yourself on the line!  
**Hiyori:** You can't just tough your way through everything!  
**Hiyori:** What's with her... Is she trying to get herself killed!?  
**Mihono:** (Akira-san...)  
**Mihono:** We have to finish this right here.  
**Kanami:** Mihono-chan?  
**Mihono:** The five of us are just barely fighting it off.  
**Mihono:** If we lose Akira-san, I don't think we can win this.  
**Mihono:** So, we're going to finish this right now!  
**Hiyori:** I'm all for it, but... how are we going to do that?  
**Mihono:** You and Kanami will help Akira-san and make an opening.  
**Mihono:** And then... Kanayamahime and me will beat Kagutsuchi.  
**Hiyori:** ...Can you do it?  
**Mihono:** Don't worry about it.  
**Mihono:** Right, Kanayamahime?  
**Kanayamahime:** We can.  
**Kanami:** ...Alright.  
**Kanami:** Let's go, Hiyori-chan.  
**Hiyori:** Fine then, I'll be with you.  
**Kanami:** Sure!  
**Kanami/Hiyori:** HAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!  
**Mihono:** Kanayamahime...  
**Mihono:** We'll give it one last flash with everything we've got!  

## 13: The Final Battle, Kagutsuchi (3)
**Mihono:** Just a little more and we'll have our chance!  
**Akira:** Kagutsuchi's started screaming back too!  
**Akira:** GAAAAAAAAGHHH!  
**Hiyori:** It's putting up a last ditch effort!?  
**Akira:** BASTAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRDD!!  
**Akira:** ...But, I see it!  
**Kanami:** Mihono-chan! Now it's your turn!!  
**Mihono:** Kanayamahime!  
**Kanayamahime:** Yes, Mihono!  
**Mihono/Kanayamahime:** YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!  

## 14: The End of a Long Night (1)
**Mihono:** Did we win...?  
**Mihono:** Kanayamahime...!?  
**Kanami:** Her body's fading...  
**Kanayamahime:** Please leave here at once.  
**Kanayamahime:** This space will soon be gone.  
**Mihono:** Then... you're coming with us too!  
**Kanayamahime:** There is no need.  
**Kanayamahime:** It's begun to collapse.  
**Kanayamahime:** Please go quickly now.  
**Hiyori:** ...! Let's go!  
**Akira:** ...  
**Kanayamahime:** Will you not leave?  
**Akira:** You saved me. I'm never gonna forget it.  
**Kanayamahime:** ......  
**Akira:** What's that look for!!  
**Kanayamahime:** It's somewhat... unexpected.  
**Akira:** ...Bye then.  
**Kanayamahime:** Yes.  
**Kanami:** I wish we could've been friends, Kanayamahime.  
**Kanayamahime:** Friends...?  
**Kanami:** Yeah, like with Mihono-chan.  
**Kanayamahime:** ...Thank you.  
**Mihono:** Kanayamahime...  
**Kanayamahime:** Please go with them, Mihono.  
**Mihono:** ......I don't think I can after all.  
**Mihono:** You have to come with me, Kanayamahime!  
**Kanayamahime:** But, I am...   
**Mihono:** Still!  
**Mihono:** Even still, you want to be together with me, don't you!?  
**Mihono:** That's what you wanted, wasn't it?  
**Mihono:** So then, let's be together!  
**Kanayamahime:** ...Thank you very much, Mihono.  
**Kanayamahime:** These last moments... I will be with you.  
**Kanami:** ......  
**Kanami:** Let's get going, Mihono-chan.  
**Mihono:** Yeah.  
**Kofuki:** It's morning already. How long's she gonna take!?  
**Kiyoka:** Hono-chan...  
**Chie:** Let's have faith in her. I'm sure that... Mihono-chan and the others will be fine.  
**Mirja:** Asakura Mihono...  
**Yui:** ...Huh? Just now, I heard a voice...?  
**Ellen:** Everyone, shhhh!  
**Everyone:** ......  
**Mihono:** We're back, everybody!  

## 15: The End of a Long Night (2)
**Akira:** ......And that's how it went. We smacked the hell out of Kagutsuchi.  
**Makoto:** You fought well, Akira-chan.  
**Makoto:** So then, Kanayamahime disappeared?  
**Akira:** Nah, about that, she's not totally gone somehow.  
**Akira:** Mihono's happy about it at least...  
**Makoto:** ...  
**Makoto:** The Atago... no, the long time the Asakura spent with Kanayamahime may have transformed her.  
**Akira:** What do you mean?  
**Makoto:** Perhaps Kagutsuchi in the netherworld and Kanayamahime in our world were on the brink of becoming separate entities.  
**Makoto:** What about Kanayamahime now?  
**Akira:** Well, she's sleeping inside of Mihono.  
**Akira:** Doesn't seem like Mihono can use Kanayamahime's powers anymore either, so it's like it all went back to normal.  
**Makoto:** ...I suppose that's the optimal outcome for us.  
**Akira:** Yeah. So long as we have Mihono and Kanayamahime, we've got a lot better chances of finding a cure.  
**Makoto:** Though... For the time being, things will likely be very busy with Asakura-san.  
**Akira:** Guess she won't be coming around here for a while.  
**Akira:** ...What about Yuuki?  
**Makoto:** It seems she's in Origami Akane-sama's custody.  
**Akira:** ...You cool with that? They're gonna take data on tamayori.  
**Makoto:** I don't mind. It would be nice if there were a different approach from the one we've taken.  
**Akira:** Yeah. Well, so long as Yuuki's safe, I don't mind either.  
**Akira:** ...I'm beat. I'll leave the noro with you, so take care of the rest for me.  
**Makoto:** I will.  
**Makoto:** Goodnight... Akira-chan. I hope you sleep soundly.  
**Akira:** I'll probably be sleeping in late tomorrow, but don't wake me up, Makocchan.  
**Makoto:** Fufu. Okay, I won't.  
**Makoto:** ...Now then, while Akira-chan rests, I'll do some maintenance... and I'll set aside the data from the battle with Kagutsuchi.  
**Makoto:** ...?  
**Makoto:** I thought I heard something just now...  
**Makoto:** Ugh... What's that...  
**???:** ......  
**Makoto:** Ugh... Ah...  
**Makoto:** The noro...!? It shouldn't be active! Why is...  
**???:** ...............  
**Makoto:** Ah... Aa...  
**Makoto:** AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!  
**Makoto?:** ...  
**Makoto?:** Hitakami Makoto... This should... do fine...  
**Makoto?:** Kanayamahime... sleeping within Asakura Mihono...  
**Makoto?:** ...I will have you back...  
**Other:** Missing Power  
**Mihono:** Mmmm.  
**Kanami:** What's wrong, Mihono-chan?  
**Mihono:** Ah-- Kanami.  
**Mihono:** See, for some reason, I can't use Kanayamahime's power anymore.  
**Kanami:** Huh?  
**Mihono:** Is it cause she's sleeping again?  
**Mihono:** NNGG-!!!!  
**Mihono:** See?  
**Kanami:** I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to see, but... that sounds bad.  
**Mihono:** Hmm... It's not really that bad, I think.  
**Kanami:** Even though you can't use her powers?  
**Mihono:** Yeah.  
**Mihono:** Cause it's not like Kanayamahime's totally gone, so, well, I'm just back to my old self.  
**Mihono:** But, that means the gap between you and me just got wider again...  
**Kanami:** ......Don't worry about that.  
**Kanami:** I know you'll get stronger again, Mihono-chan.  
**Mihono:** Yeah maybe.  
**Mihono:** Where there's a will there's a way! I'll keep at it some more-!
