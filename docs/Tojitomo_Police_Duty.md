Tojitomo Police Duty
====================

## 1: Helping Out at the Police Station!?
**Chie:** Mirja, everyone's here. What did you want to talk with us about?  
**Mirja:** It seems that next month, police stations will be holding an "Aradama Safety Awareness Campaign."  
**Mirja:** Since toji are a part of the overall police organization, they've requested our help in the form of "working with a separate unit."  
**Mihono:** Aradama Safety Awareness Campaign!? What're we going to have to do for that?  
**Mirja:** I've only heard a rough outline of the campaign myself...  
**Mirja:** But it sounds like they want us to go out wearing police uniforms and help people understand ways they can prevent being harmed by aradama.  
**Mihono:** Ehh; that sounds fun! I want to try!  
**Kanami:**ã€€Me too! Being a toji's fun, but I want to see what it's like for other parts of the police.  
**Chie:** I think I'll volunteer for it too. I've always wanted to try wearing a police uniform.  
**Yui:** Kanami-chan and Mihono-chan and Chie-san dressed up like police officers!? Just thinking about it's getting my heart pounding!  
**Yui:** Chie-san, if you could do me a favor, could you arrest me first~?  
**Kiyoka:** So you want to be the one getting arrested, Yui-chan...  
**Mirja:** Before going any further, I'd better exclude this pervert from the candidates.  
**Yui:** Sure! Go right ahead. I have to be there that day besides, with with the best telescopic camera I can get, to preserve them all dressed up!  
**Ellen:** So, how are we going to decide who goes anyway?  
**Mirja:** We don't have a schedule for next month's assignments yet, so you can volunteer without worrying about whether it conflicts with your regular duties.  
**Mirja:** They've asked for us to send 3 people. If you'd like to go, raise your hands.  
**Chie/Mihono/Kanami:** Heeere!  
**Mihono:** Cool; that's 3 of us! That means we're good to go, right?  
**Mirja:** It seems that way. It's nice we could settle it so easily...  
**Mirja:** Sorry, this call is from HQ.  
**Mirja:** Yes, Kitora speaking. ...Eh? They've rescheduled the campaign!? ...I see. Thank you for notifying me. Goodbye.  
**Mirja:** They had unfortunate news. The campaign will now be held on an earlier date.  
**Chie/Mihono/Kanami:** EHH-!?  
**Mirja:** It's going to be one week from now; will that be an issue for any of you?  
**Mihono:** Ehh; but I'm doing an expedition then!  
**Kanami:** Same here!  
**Chie:** I have an important meeting that day too...  
**Mirja:** I see... We'll need to make rearrangements then. The ones who will be available on that day are...  
**Hiyori:** J-Just the three of us...?  
**Kofuki:** Are you for real? Literally anybody else'd be better for doing that kind of campaign!  
**Hirona:** ...She's not wrongg. I don't think these are the right people to cheerily spreading awareness.  
**Mirja:** I understand your point, but as a branch of the police, this is an indisputable duty of ours. There won't be any turning it down.  
**Kofuki:** Seriously...? I already know this'll go bad.  

## 2: The Campaign Involves...!?
On the day of the campaign.

  
**Police PR Official:** Thank you, all of you, for coming out to our station today. I know it's a little sudden, but could you change into these police uniforms?  
**Hiyori:** Police uniforms... Right, the point of the campaign was to wipe out aradama dressed in these?  
**Police PR Official:** Aradama!? You've got it all wrong. This is what we wanted you to take care of today. Handing out these pamphlets.  
**Police PR Official:** Toji, dressed up in police uniform, giving pamphlets on how to avoid being harmed by aradama. Sounds like a decent way to spread awareness, doesn't it?  
**Police PR Official:** So anyway, I'll come back to get you when you're finished changing. Thanks again for helping out.  
**Hirona:** They left us to itt.  
**Hiyori:** Handing out pamphlets... Is there really a point in getting toji to do that?  
**Hirona:** ...I don't know about that, but civil servants have to follow orders, so let's get ready to do it.  
**Kofuki:** Tch, I'd rather be going wild on some aradama-chan than handing out some dumb pamphlets...  
**Station Intercom:** Aradama outbreak! Aradama outbreak! Riot squat, dispatch at once!   
**Kofuki:** Ohh! All I had to do was ask for some!  
**Hiyori:** Good thing it happened before we got changed. Let's move out.  
**Aradama:** Guoooooo...  
**Hirona:** ...--!  
**Kofuki:** Hey, hold up, let me have those! OORYAH---!  
**Hiyori:** TAAAAAAAAHH!!  
**Kofuki:** The hell, we cleared them out in a second. Where's the fun in that.  
**Hiyori:** I'm glad we could at least do something to help before dealing with the pamphlets. Come on, let's get back to the station.  
**Hirona:** ......We're backk.  
**Police PR Official:** Geez, you just got here and you're already putting in some serious work. Thanks a lot.  
**Police Officer 1:** It's incredible how fast they handled it. You toji really are something.  
**Police Officer 2:** I couldn't believe how quick you got out there. You sure are reliable.  
**Hiyori:** Hey... Aren't there more of you now? ...What are they here for?  
**Police PR Official:** See, after they saw you deal with those aradama, the police around the station were saying, it's such a waste just having them handing out pamphlets! They came around wanting you to help their departments.  
**Police Officer 1:** We're all just different parts of the police, so don't you think you could help with some detective work?  
**Police Officer 2:** Hang on, I want them to take a look at our riot squad training first!  
**Police Officer 3:** Hey, the traffic department could use their abilities more than anybody! With that speed of yours...  
**Police PR Official:** So, well, it ended up like this... What do you think? Would you help us with some other assignments besides the pamphlets?  
**Hirona:** Hmmm, they all seem very different from what toji are used to doing...  
**Hiyori:** If they need us, I think we should help them out.  
**Kofuki:** Hey, it beats pamphlet duty at least.  
**Police PR Official:** Great. Then, if we could split you 3 up and help with each of the departments.  

## 3: Who Will Prove Themselves?
**Hiyori:** That's the morning's work finally taken care of. Police work sure is pretty demanding in a lot of ways.  
**Kofuki:** Yeah. I didn't even get to beat any aradama-chan but the day's already half over.  
**Hirona:** ......It sounds like, in the afternoon, all of us will be working together to help the detective department.  
**Hirona:** They said, after we had our fill in the cafeteria, to meet in the shopping district wearing our school uniforms.  
**Kofuki:** In our uniforms? We don't have to wear the police uniforms anymore?  
**Hirona:** They want us to tail a suspect while dressed as everyday schoolgirls... We should be fine like this.  
**Detective:** Hey, I'm glad you could make it. Today, I want you to help us catch a repeat purse-snatcher in this shopping district by tailing someone.  
**Detective:** Oh-- the suspect's already arrived. If you girls could act natural and follow after them.  
**Hirona:** ......Understood.  
**Hiyori:** Hm? The suspect's going inside a store. What should we do?  
**Hirona:** ......Let's stay out of sight and wait for them to come back out for now.  
**Kofuki:** Oi, we haven't seen anything from them after they went in. How long do we have to wait out here for?  
**Hiyori:** Waiting patiently seems like a big part of tailing someone.  
**Kofuki:** Damnit... How long're you gonna make us wait for! Aghh, I'm starting to get pissed off just standing around!  
**Hiyori:** Ah-- they just left the store. They're looking kind of suspicious too; should we catch them before they try anything?  
**Hirona:** ...They haven't done anything yet, so we wouldn't be able to arrest them if we went noww. Let's be patient until they make a move.  
**Detective:** That's exactly right. It's commendable the way you're keeping a level head.  
**Hirona:** It's not that impressive... It's just that it'd be extremely inefficient to let them get away with this many people staking them out...  
**Detective:** Hahahah, you're right about that. We could use someone like you... Ah--!  
**Detective:** The suspect grabbed an old lady's purse and made a break for it! After them!  
**Hirona/Hiyori/Kofuki:** On it!  
**Hirona:** We've apprehended the criminal...   
**Detective:** Hey, nice work.  
**Hiyori:** You really knew what to do, Hirona.  
**Kofuki:** Damnit; if only I'd jumped them with you.  
**Hirona:** ...Shichinosato-san, you were wasting your concentration by moving around needlessly before the suspect moved.  
**Hirona:** There's limit to how much someone can concentrate. I could focus on arresting them efficiently since I made sure to only act after they started doing something suspicious.  
**Detective:** Thanks, all 3 of you, for helping with this. I'll handle the rest, so could you go see what the traffic department needs you for next?  
**Detective:** They said they wanted you there as soon as possible, so don't worry about getting changed. Give them my regards.  

## 4: Toji VS Speeding Violation!?
**Hirona:** ...Thank you for your service. The three of us toji are here to help the traffic divisionn.  
**Traffic Officer:** Good, you're here. What we want you to help us with are managing speeding violations.  
**Traffic Officer:** This area sees a lot of speeding, so I'd like you to stand at the ready here and help us catch any speeding cars.  
**Hiyori:** I get it; if it's a race, I should be good with this.  
**Kofuki:** Yeah, I'm not losing to Hirona either.  
**Hirona:** ...Ah, it turned into a competition.  
**Hirona:** (Though, it made the two of them motivated... Let's just work with this.)  
**Hiyori:** Mmh, that car that just went by was going way too fast.  
**Traffic Officer:** They're clearly going over the speed limit.  
**Hiyori:** Leave this one to me!  
**Kofuki:** Hey, wait up! I'm not going down without a fight!  
**Hiyori:** Nn...? The car should be right in front of us, but it's gone. Did it get away down a side road...!?  
**Kofuki:** You gotta be kidding... That side road was back up there, wasn't it? Whatever, let's get back fast.  
**Kofuki:** ...Wait, huh? Doesn't that look like a traffic jam up on the frontage road?  
**Hiyori:** Seems like it. Why would there be so much traffic this far out of town though...  
**Kofuki:** Check it out! That car from before's stuck in traffic!  
**Hiyori:** That's awfully convenient... Let's get it before it gets away.  
**Hiyori:** Hm? Hirona and the officer are already at the car. Hey, Hirona, what happened here?  
**Hirona:** ...Ah, Juujou-san, Shichinosato-san. We safely pulled over the speeding car. Thank you for your helpp.  
**Hiyori:** Help...? Did you catch them again?  
**Hirona:** The police officer is the one who caught them. I only caused the traffic jam so the car would stop.  
**Kofuki:** You made a traffic jam!? How'd you do that?  
**Hirona:** I asked the other police officers to close the frontage roadss.  
**Hirona:**  ...Even if we caught up to the runaway car using jin'i, there's no guarantee they would stopp.  
**Hirona:** It's good we could catch them before they caused an accident.  
**Hiyori:** That's some great planning on your part.  
**Kofuki:** Not too bad for you.  
**Traffic Officer:** That's right. Nitta-san, I'm impressed you could think so rationally in the spur of the moment. Maybe you could stay on with us in the traffic department here.  
**Hirona:** ...Thank you for the offerr.  
**Hiyori:** Still, Kofuki and I didn't get to do much, did we.  
**Kofuki:** Not like I really care. So long as I get to have fun with some aradama-chan, I'm good.  
**Aradama:** GUOOOOOOO...  
**Hiyori:** Aradama!?  
**Kofuki:** That's what I'm talking about! If we're fighting aradama-chan, nobody's beating me! Time to blow off some stress!  

## 5: Making Up for It With Our Last Assignment!?
**Aradama:** Guooooo...  
**Hiyori:** TAAHH----!  
**Kofuki:** Now aradama-chan are where I shine! That's what I love!  
**Hirona:** ...It doesn't seem like I have much do heree. Do your best, you twooo.  
**Hiyori:** Kgh... Even beating them one after another, more and more are coming out...  
**Hirona:** ...Though I guess I can't go saying that. It would ruin my efficiency if I lost reputation for neglecting my duties.  
**Hiyori:** (If we keep fighting here though, the people caught in the traffic jam could get hurt...)  
**Hiyori:** Hirona! Kofuki! I'm going to lead the aradama away, so follow me!  
**Hirona:** ...Understoood.  
**Kofuki:** Oi, Hiyori! Where do you think you're taking all my aradama-chan!!?  
**Hiyori:** Alright, this'll do. Stick with me.  
**Aradama:** GUOOOOOOOO...  
**Kofuki:** Oi oi, what the hell are you thinking, dragging us out into the hills?  
**Hirona:** I understand the point was to lead them away from people, to keep casualties to a minimum...  
**Hirona:** But was there really a need to bring them this far... It's a dead end at the cliff up ahead, isn't itt?  
**Hiyori:** Yeah, that's right. So come on, all you aradama, this way!  
**Hirona:** ...The aradama you're leading are getting backed up in front of the cliff. It's like...!  
**Kofuki:** One big aradama-chan traffic jam!  
**Hiyori:** I got the idea from your plan before, Hirona.  
**Hiyori:** If we gather up the aradama in one spot where they can't move, it'll be simple for the three of us to clear them out.  
**Hirona:** That is a nicely efficient plan. We should start then.  
**Hirona/Hiyori/Kofuki:** YAAAAAAAAAHH!!!!  
**Hiyori:** Three toji, returning from suppressing aradama.  
**Police PR Official:** Welcome back. And it looks like you've put in some serious work again. Thanks for protecting the people.  
**Hiyori:** We just did what's expected of us as toji. So, what's our next assignment...?  
**Police PR Official:** There's plenty of things we'd like your help with, but unfortunately, that's it for today's work.  
**Hiyori:** ...Isn't there anything more we could help a little with? We weren't really that useful in the end...  
**Police PR Official:** Not at all; you helped out more than enough.  
**Kofuki:** You heard 'em. Let's get out of here, Hiyori. It's more fun for me playing with aradama-chan anyway.  
**Hiyori:** ...Alright then. Thanks for everything today.  
**Hirona:** ...I'll be leaving now too. I learned a lot from Juujou-san's combat tactics, so it was a valuable experience.  
**Police PR Official:** Good work, all of you. Ah, Nitta-san. If you like the sound of it, maybe consider a career as a police officer?  
**Hirona:** ...A police officer...? I guess so. It depends on the cost benefits, but I'll consider itt.  

## 6: Another Call from the Police Station!?
**Mihono:** Hirona, I heard you were awesome in that police campaign they did!  
**Hirona:** ...I tried my bestt.  
**Kanami:** You're so lucky; I wanted to wear police clothes too-.  
**Chie:** I know. Maybe we'll get another chance next year...  
**Mirja:** Actually, it'll be next week.  
**Mihono:** Next week!?  
**Mirja:** Yes. The last campaign was very well received with the police, so they've sent us another request.  
**Hirona:** ...That's very sudden of them.  
**Hirona:** But, that's good to hear. It it was worth working so hard if it gives the rest of you a chancee.  
**Mirja:** You say that as if this doesn't concern you, but you'll be returning again this time, Nitta Hirona.  
**Hirona:** Eh...?  
**Mirja:** From the sound of it, your efforts caught the eye of the higher ups at the station, so they specifically requested you.  
**Mihono:** Wowww! Way to go, Hirona!  
**Kanami:** Who else is going? Do I get to go?  
**Mirja:** Only Nitta Hirona and 2 others will be going, but the only ones without plans on that day are... Mashiko Kaoru and Kohagura Ellen.  
**Ellen:** Wow! Kaoru and I get to be police officers!?  
**Mashiko:** Gehh... Do we have to? I thought I'd get to spend that day lazing around.  
The day of the event.

  
**Police PR Official:** Nitta-san, we're glad to have you back. We're looking forward to working with you again.  
**Hirona:** Okayy. Please take care of mee.  
**Police PR Official:** We're looking forward to working with you two too.  
**Ellen:** You can count on us! So then, what should we be doing?  
**Police PR Official:** This time, we'd like you all to act as police chief and deputies for the day.  
**Hirona:** ...That's an important positionn... Should toji really be doing it?  
**Police PR Official:** Sure. Actually, if I'm being honest, we were originally going to invite local idols for the position, but something came up all of a sudden...  
**Kaoru:** That explains why this came out of nowhere. So we're just here to fill in as best we can.  
**Ellen:** Now now, Kaoru. We're all members of the same police organization here, so let's make sure to do our duty!  
**Hirona:**  That's right, it's less cost-effective rushing to call in outside workers, so I think they made a sensible choice.  
**Police PR Official:** We're only having you do a ceremonial event this time; all you need is to say a few greetings and ride a car in a parade. So, don't take it too seriously and just have fun with it.  
**Police PR Official:** We have uniforms for you here, so go ahead and get changed. I'll leave you to it.  
**Kaoru:** Police chief and deputies for a day... It's just for show, right? Heheh, today's basically a day off then.  
**Ellen:** Kaoru, you can't go slacking off. If anything goes wrong, we'll have to do what we can to help too.  
**Ellen:** Let's make sure we're ready to do this. You, me, and Hirona too.  
**Hirona:** ...Okayy. It is our mission, after all. I'll try to do what I've been assigned with as little effort needed.  

## 7: Go Forth! Police Chief and Deputies for the Day
**Police PR Official:** Here, hang this over your shoulder.  
**Ellen:** Wow! A "Police Chief for the Day" sash! Is it really okay for me to be police chief?  
**Police PR Official:** You're the tallest, and you seem like you make a good leader, so I think you're the best fit. Now, if you two could put these sashes on.  
**Kaoru:** Chief deputy? Now that's the best position; if things go wrong, I can dump it all on the chief.  
**Ellen:** If things go wrong, we're all going to work together to fix it. Right, Hirona?  
**Hirona:** ...Right. I'll do what I cann.  
**Police PR Official:** Alright then, let's head right out for the parade. We want you three to smile and wave from the car to the people on the roadside.  
**Ellen:** We can handle smiling! You can do that, right, Kaoru, Hirona?  
**Hirona:** ...Smiling... smiling... Would this be enough...?  
**Ellen:** Looking very cute, Hirona! Hm? You have a nice grin too, Kaoru. What for?  
**Kaoru:** All the people on the side of the road are looking at me and waving. The deputy chief for the day's making her grand appearance! Make way, make way-!  
**Ellen:** Do you think you're a daimyo or something?  
**Kaoru:** Oh, come to think of it. I never get to do luxurious missions like this, so I couldn't help it...  
**Hirona:** Still, we aren't even performers, so I feel sort of bad for doing thiss...  
**Kaoru:** Why? Rather than calling up some idols, it's cheaper to get civil servants to do it. Plus the police were happy about it anyway, weren't they?  
**Hirona:** That's fine, but... this is too different from last time...  
**Radio Transmission:** This is HQ... A man who recently burgled a residential area is currently making an escape through the central avenue intersection...  
**Ellen:** Central avenue intersection... Isn't that where we just passed through?  
**Police PR Official:** We're stopping the parade temporarily and going after the criminal. Can you all help us with that?  
**Ellen:** Of course we will! The police chief and deputies for the day are moving out!  
**Kaoru:** [pant pant]... Why'd this guy have to be so fast... Freeze already... [pant pant]...  
**Ellen:** [pant pant]... We completely lost sight of him...  
**Police Officer:** Now we're in trouble. There's a maze of alleys in here, so all it takes is losing sight of him once...  
**Hirona:** Ah...! Then, what if you brought out police dogs?  
**Ellen:** Good thinking, Hirona! Would that work, Mr. Policeman?  
**Police Officer:** I'd love to give them a try, but police dogs have a very touchy sense of smell. They wouldn't be much help going down streets lined with restaurants.  
**Hirona:** ...Oh... I hadn't even thought of that.  
**Ellen:** But then, how are we supposed to find him again...  
**Kaoru:** If it were an aradama, all it'd take is a look at the spectrum finder. Not much we can do against a person though...  
**Nene:** Nene! Nenee----!  
**Kaoru:** Nn? What's wrong, Nene?  
**Hirona:** ...Could he be telling us to go that way?  
**Ellen:** We don't have any other leads, so we might as well try following Nene.  

## 8: Can You Make the Arrest, Police Chief for the Day!?
**Nene:** Nene-! Nee- nene-!  
**Hirona:** [pant pant]... Now we're in the back alleys of back alleys...  
**Ellen:** We're moving too fast, the police can't keep up! Let's wait a minute!  
**Nene:** Neene-! Nenene-!  
**Kaoru:** Looks like we don't have that kind of time; just have to keep going. What now, chief and deputy for the day?  
**Ellen:** It won't do us any good if he gets away from us like this. Let's keep going!  
**Kaoru:** [pant pant]... We came pretty far; are we sure this guy's even in here...?  
**Nene:** Nene-! Nenenene-!  
**Ellen:** Wow! Isn't that the criminal running over there!?  
**Hirona:** I think that's a dead end up ahead. Why don't we corner him there?  
**Kaoru:** [pant pant]... We've finally got you trapped! You're gonna pay for making me run so much... We're arresting you right here!  
**Ellen:** Hang on, Kaoru! The police officers still aren't here yet!  
**Kaoru:** Kgh... Nene must've been too fast for them to catch up.  
**Kaoru:** Would we get in trouble if we arrested him on our own without asking first?  
**Ellen:** Maybe... If it were an aradama, we could deal with it whenever we wanted, but when it comes to people... Still, we can't just leave him like this...  
**Hirona:** ...Umm? What are you so confused aboutt? I'm handcuffing him.  
**Hirona:** 11:35 AM, culprit arrested.  
**Kaoru/Ellen:** Huh...?  
**Kaoru:** Is that okay? For us to just go ahead and arrest him.  
**Culprit:** Like hell it's okay! Just cause you're wearing some fake police chief sign doesn't give you the right to arrest anybody...!  
**Hirona:** ...It does, actuallyy. In the case that a culprit is caught in the act or fleeing from the crime, a police chief or deputy chief for the day has the right to arrest.  
**Kaoru:** W-We do!?  
**Ellen:** I had no idea.  
**Police Officer:** Thanks for even going so far as arresting them. Still, I'm surprised you knew you had the right to do that.  
**Hirona:** Welll... I only just learned about it too.  
**Kaoru:** You just found out? When?  
**Hirona:** When they told us about today's assignment, I looked it up when they gave us time to change.  
**Ellen:** Wow! So you did some research thinking something like this might happen? Nice going!  
**Hirona:** ...No, it's not like I had any idea this would happenn. I just thought, having someone who didn't know their role in the ceremony would be too inefficient...   
**Hirona:** I looked up a lot of things, to see if I could help with somethingg.  
**Police Officer:** You're something else! We really lucked out, getting a girl like you to come by.  
**Police Officer:** Alright, the rest of us on the scene will take care of the culprit, so you can go on back to the parade.  
**Police Officer:** And, once you're done there, I hear offers have been pouring in from all around the station for you, so I hope you're feeling ready to give it your best effort.  
**Kaoru:** Gehh, I thought this whole mission was just for show; there's more work we've gotta do...?  
**Ellen:** The two of us can't stand by letting Hirona show us up. Let's do everything we can to help out for today!
