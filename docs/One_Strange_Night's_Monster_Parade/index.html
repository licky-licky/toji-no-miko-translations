Ah, it&#x27;s finished! Phew... Carving out a pumpkin is easier than it seems, isn&#x27;t it?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> It may be hard on the outside, but it isn&#x27;t so difficult to cut with a knife.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Come to think of it, why do we use pumpkins anyway?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> About pumpkin lanterns-- Halloween is thought to have originated with the ancient Celts, and is largely based on a certain legend.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> That is, the lingering spirits of sinners who were unable to pass on would wander the land carrying lanterns carved from turnips.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> It seems that at some point, people who had emigrated to America began carving pumpkins into lanterns in place of turnips.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> As it goes, these Jack O&#x27;lanterns are said to drive off evil spirits and welcome in kind ones.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Lingering spirits... It&#x27;s kind of scary to think about, but if they drive off evil spirits, then that&#x27;s a bit of a relief.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> And I just can&#x27;t wait to put on cute costumes and makeup with everyone for Halloween.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> You&#x27;re giving it your all to get things ready for the Halloween party, aren&#x27;t you, Musumi-san.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I am! Have you decided which costumes you&#x27;re going to wear yet, Iwakura-san, Juujou-san?<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Well, I was thinking it over. But I&#x27;m not so sure yet.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...I haven&#x27;t gotten anything yet. Anyway, Halloween has become completely natural in Japan now, hasn&#x27;t it.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> It has. Even theme parks seem to be holding special limited time Halloween events.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Hmm. That sounds like it could be neat to try too.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> If you have the opportunity, you should go and see one.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Now then, why don&#x27;t we bring things to a stopping point here and continue the rest of the preparations tomorrow?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Good idea.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I know! While we&#x27;re having dinner, we can think over what Juujou-san should do for her costume!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> We should be able to rent costumes too, so I think it would be alright to come up with a list of ideas first!<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Sure! That sounds like a plan.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Not you too, Iwakura-san... Me in a costume, it&#x27;s just...<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Well, we don&#x27;t have to do any more than think about it, okay? I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll be fun.  </p><p>That night... Kiyoka and the others received an urgent dispatch to an abandoned factory.</p><p><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> When I got the call to come here in the middle of the night, I didn&#x27;t expect there to be so many other people...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> It could be that these aradama were recognized as enough of a menace to warrant it.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Thank you for responding to our summons despite the late hour.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> The aradama that appeared here seem to have some strange characteristics.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> After a recent reading we picked up, we&#x27;ve decided to take immediate action now.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Shidou-senpai? What do you mean when you say these aradama are strange?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Even though they appears on spectrum finders, they can&#x27;t be seen in person... Or so it seems.ã€€We thought it might be an equipment malfunction at first, but it&#x27;s been happening too often here.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> It&#x27;s like there&#x27;s ghosts.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Even though Halloween is close, a real ghost would be a little...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> That&#x27;s right... Something like ghosts couldn&#x27;t actually be here.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Still, it feels like there really could be one here, in a place like this.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...!? I was trying not to think about that...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Whoops, sorry. Anyway, we should beat these aradama as soon as we find them.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> I think that&#x27;s the best course of action too.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Let&#x27;s first look for them using our spectrum finders. Contact everyone the moment you detect anything. Now, let&#x27;s get to work!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> (We&#x27;ve been walking all over since then... But there&#x27;s no signs of aradama at all. Are they really even here...?)<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> And... I feel like we&#x27;ve been walking in circles this whole time. Don&#x27;t you think so, Juujou-san?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Huh? Juujou-san?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Is something wrong?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Juujou-san was right with me until a minute ago, and now she&#x27;s gone...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Did she go to search someplace else? Still, to do so without informing anyone... What do you think about this, Etou Kanami?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Etou Kanami?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...Eh, Etou-san&#x27;s gone too!?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> What if it isn&#x27;t an aradama after all, but there&#x27;s something else here...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Don&#x27;t allow your nerves to get the better of you, Musumi Kiy--<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> B-But... We&#x27;ve been walking in circles this whole time...! And now Juujou-san and Etou-san disappeared--<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...KYAAAAAAA! I&#x27;M FALLIIIING!?  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="2-with-as-much-courage-you-can-muster"></a>2: With as Much Courage You Can Muster<a class="hash-link" href="#2-with-as-much-courage-you-can-muster" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Nngh... It hurts a little all over...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> What even happened...?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...Where is this, anyway? It looks kind of like one of Renpu&#x27;s research labs, but... It&#x27;s too dark in here.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Oh right, where&#x27;s Mirja-san!? Mirja-saaan!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah, my phone!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...There&#x27;s no service. ...Am I completely on my own?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> No, there has to be somebody nearby...! Shidou-saaan! Iwakura-saaan...! Juujou-saaan...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...I-I&#x27;ll just take a quick look around. Though, it&#x27;s scary... It is scary.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Hya... Did something just move!? There was some kind of faint light...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Like a Jack O&#x27;lantern... almost.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It couldn&#x27;t be... a lingering spirit, could it?<br>
<strong>???:</strong> ...Aaa....a.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Wh-What... was that!?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Is there actually an invisible aradama here!?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Wait, on the ground here, these are... Glasses?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> These are just like Mirja-san&#x27;s.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> They aren&#x27;t very dirty either... That has to be it. If her glasses are here, she must be nearby... Maybe the others too.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> If they fell down like I did, they might be hurt...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> If they are, then I have to help them! It&#x27;s a little intimidating... But Musumi Kiyoka won&#x27;t give up here!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Okay... The ones here are just normal aradama. If it&#x27;s just these... I can manage.<br>
<strong>???:</strong> ...Aaa...a.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> There it is... That weird sound again. What&#x27;s making it?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Juujou-san and Iwakura-san! Ahh... I&#x27;m so glad to see you. I finally found you.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I defeated some aradama, but I&#x27;m still detecting more of them. And, since I got separated from Mirja-san and everyone...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ? Is something the matter?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Kiyokaa...?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Yes? I&#x27;m here now...?<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Kiyokaa...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Could you please stop talking in that weird voice? Also, is it me, or are you covered in sweat?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Actually, it&#x27;s more like... Y-Y... Y-Y-You&#x27;re!? You&#x27;re melting!!!????<br>
<strong>Two Aradama:</strong>  Kiyoka...a!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...KYAAAAAAAA!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> [pant, pant]... Juujou-san, Iwakura-san... They turned into aradama. Uuu...

<strong>Sanae:</strong> Juujou-san, are you hurt anywhere?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> No, I&#x27;m fine. Still, what is this place? Weren&#x27;t we supposed to be looking for aradama in an abandoned factory?<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> We were... This seems to be an unused research facility though.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Ah! There&#x27;s an aradama&#x27;s signal over that way.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> We should check it out.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Look! Etou-san is over there fighting! Let&#x27;s back her up!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> So you&#x27;re okay then, Kanami. Good thing we found you so soon.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Kanami?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> ...Kanami?<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Something&#x27;s not right about her... Back up, Juujou-san!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> [sizzle, sizzle sizzle]...<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> Ki...ki... SHAAAA!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> What the... Kanami turned into an aradama!?<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Is this the strange aradama Shidou-senpai told us about!?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Insulting Kanami by disguising as her like that... Prepare yourself!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> What wass the deal with that, anyway...<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> If aradama could go up to people looking like their friends, a lot of people are going to get hurt... Hopefully that&#x27;s something only the aradama here can do.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Right. We&#x27;ve got to destroy these aradama and find the others.<br>
<strong>Voice:</strong> ...I-Is someone over there?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> That voice...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> WAH-!? Y-You again!?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Are you... the real Juujou-san and Iwakura-san?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> I&#x27;m the real one!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I-If you are, then... What foods are rich in soy isoflavones!?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Tofu and natto. Here, I&#x27;ll make sure you&#x27;re real too. At our last meeti... Or anyway, who was absent last time? If you are the real Kiyoka, you should be able to answer that.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Hono-chan and Kofuki-san. Hono-chan went shopping with Chie-san. Kofuki-san was suppressing aradama with Tsugumi-san.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> No doubt about it; it really is you.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ahh, I wanted to see you two so badly... Juujou-san, Iwakura-san!<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Um... You believe we&#x27;re the real ones for now, don&#x27;t you, Musumi-san?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah, yes, of course I do. A little while ago, I found aradama that looked just like you two... It&#x27;s all so confusing.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Us too, we just saw Etou-san change into an aradama...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> They started melting all of a sudden... I was so scared on my own...!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> It&#x27;s not something anyone&#x27;d be comfortable seeing, is it...<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> If the three of us stick together, you should be able to get some peace of mind, Musumi-san. Let&#x27;s hurry and find the others.<br>

<strong>Kanami:</strong> I guess they&#x27;re the same as the ordinary aradama we fight after all?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> That seems to be the case. I didn&#x27;t notice any major differences between them.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> That Kanami and Mirja just destroyed an aradama. It should be safe to treat them like they&#x27;re real.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> No... We have to be careful here! I have Mirja-san&#x27;s glasses with me, but she&#x27;s still wearing them... That&#x27;s a little suspicious!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> In that case... It&#x27;d be best to ask them things only the real ones could know.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> We have to make absolutely sure. Okay, let&#x27;s call out to them.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Kanami!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Wah!? What are you shouting for, Hiyori-chan?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> What was the present I gave you for your birthday?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Natto over rice, and homemade nimono! It was extra tasty!<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> ...Eh!?<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> (...She gave natto over rice as a birthday present?)<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Alright, that confirms it... You&#x27;re the real Kanami!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> C&#x27;mon, you&#x27;re so weird, Hiyori-chan.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Um... I think these are your glasses, Mirja-san.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Thank you very much, Musumi Kiyoka. I was using a spare pair after I lost these.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> A spare pair!? Then that means, you&#x27;re the real Mirja-san, aren&#x27;t you!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Juujou Hiyori had the same thing to say about Etou Kanami. Did something happen to you three?<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Well, you&#x27;ll never believe this, but...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I see. So that&#x27;s what happened.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Kanami and Mirja... Everyone&#x27;s here.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I was a bit anxious when I found myself in an unfamiliar place with nobody else around, but we can now finish our original mission.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Iwakura-san, Iwakura-san, do you know anything we can do to confirm if that&#x27;s the real Shidou-san?<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> (I think it&#x27;s fine, or at least, I feel like that&#x27;s the real Shidou-senpai, but...)<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> What is it?<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Um... Shidou-senpai, this question might sound strange, but, when we first met, do you remember what we spoke about?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Of course. We talked about personal strength, didn&#x27;t we? That was a good chance for reflection for me too.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> I&#x27;m glad to hear it; that you remembered.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> What could we ask Sayaka...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Hey, Sayaka-chan! Will you have a sparring session with me real quick? It&#x27;s very important right now!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> I don&#x27;t really understand, but okay.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> An aradama that imitates a human form. That sounds like trouble... Though I never ran into one myself.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Oh yeah, you said there was an aradama that looked like me, wasn&#x27;t there? Was it about the same as me when it came to swordfighting too?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Kanami. ...You&#x27;re not about to say you wished you could have fought it, are you?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> You really get me, Hiyori-chan. But, I was only thinking that a little.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Look... The aradama grouped up.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Even if they try looking like us, they&#x27;re still a sorry sight. Let&#x27;s beat them down fast!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="5-even-if-its-halloween-i-dont-want-any-mischief"></a>5: Even if it&#x27;s Halloween, I Don&#x27;t Want Any Mischief!<a class="hash-link" href="#5-even-if-its-halloween-i-dont-want-any-mischief" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Sayaka:</strong> The aradama have all been defeated. There aren&#x27;t any more readings.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> We didn&#x27;t see any more aradama looking like people after that... But what even were they?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I&#x27;m not exactly sure, but... It&#x27;s better that we didn&#x27;t see any more. I&#x27;d rather forget I ever saw them...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Well, I guess there&#x27;s no point in us worrying about it.<br>
<strong>Someone&#x27;s Voice:</strong> Anybody-, is anybody there-?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Eek... Did you hear that strange voice just now!?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Ah, there is someone there. This is Ban Tsugumi. Please tell me if all of you are together.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I can guide you through an escape route this way up to the surface-.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> It seems like you safely defeated the aradama. I didn&#x27;t expect any less from you all. By the way, did you find the strange aradama from the rumors?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It was so hard on us... Everyone disappeared all of a sudden, and, before I knew it, we were somehow underground...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> When I was alone, I thought I found other people... But they changed into aradama...! It was scary like you wouldn&#x27;t believe...<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I see. This factory, and the research laboratory underneath it, have a bit of a shady history...<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Before its closure, there were common reports of researchers abruptly losing consciousness. And, after its closure, there were signs of aradama on spectrum finders, but they couldn&#x27;t be found in person. It&#x27;s a highly interesting case.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...I wish they&#x27;d tell us things like that before we got sent on our mission!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> This factory itself has been abandoned for a long time, so maybe it wasn&#x27;t considered that important.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I wish this had all been settled before I became a toji then...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Though, Musumi Kiyoka. Because of how quickly we acted, the aradama causing this issue were dealt with. So, don&#x27;t you think things should be settled here now?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> That&#x27;s right. Thanks to all of you, I think that should be the last of the strange happenings here.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Speaking of strange, why did we end up in that underground lab anyway?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I remember feeling like I was falling down, but when I looked up at the ceiling, there weren&#x27;t any holes I could have fallen through...?<br>
<strong>Everyone There:</strong> ............<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I&#x27;m not quite sure about that now, but, hmm. What if we think about it like this?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> How about, the aradama decided to get up to some mischief for Halloween?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> That&#x27;s a little too out there... Right?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> As if something like an aradama could have fun with Halloween.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Fufu, I was only joking of course.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I would have greatly liked to have seen the aradama you found here. If only I&#x27;d gone along with you from the beginning.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You look happy just hearing about an unusual aradama...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> With Tsugumi-san acting so much like her usual self, it&#x27;s almost like everything that happened was like a dream.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> In that case, why don&#x27;t we all return home now? We&#x27;ll need to continue our preparations for Halloween tomorrow.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That&#x27;s right! We also have the important job left of deciding on Juujou-san&#x27;s Halloween costume.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Didn&#x27;t I tell you... I said I didn&#x27;t need one.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Wait, that sounds like fun! What would Hiyori-chan look best in-?<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> So many things would look good on Juujou-san that it&#x27;s hard to rule any out.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I know what you mean!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Know what what means? And anyway, don&#x27;t get started on this here.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> They&#x27;re a real noisy bunch, aren&#x27;t they.<br>
