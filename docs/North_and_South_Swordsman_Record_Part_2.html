It Started...</h2><p>Before the start of the Renpu Heijou Joint-Training.</p><p><strong>Suu:</strong> ...I'm overwhelmingly out of place here!<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> Could you not start shouting out of nowhere.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> But, will you... just look around!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> ......<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ......<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ......<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> .....<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Not only is there Juujou-san and Iwakura-san we met in Harajuku the other day...<br><strong>Suu:</strong> There's girls like Itomi-san, who makes sure to finish any mission you give her, and that girl who loves fighting aradama way too much... Aradama-Must-Die-Man Shichinosato-san too!<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> I told you not to be so loud... They'll think it's rude if they hear you. And what's Aradama-Must-Die-Man anyway?<br><strong>Suu:</strong> ...That's slang for her.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> She loves fighting aradama and stuff. To where it's impossible to wrap your head around... Isn't she sort of scary...?<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Please God, I'm begging you... Don't put me in the same group as her...<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> You're right that there are strong fighters here from both schools, but we're only here to train together. You're worrying too much.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> And besides, she's another student from Renpu, the same as you.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> That doesn't reassure me at a--<br><strong>Suu:</strong> ......<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> ...What is it now? Why are you hiding behind me?<br><strong>Suu:</strong> There, over there... It's Tsubakuro-san... and Satsuki-san, from the elite guard.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Yomi-onee-san, do I really have to be here for this too-?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> You do. This is a part of our duties as the elite guard.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> What do we have to do?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> We need to instruct everyone gathered here on the details of their training. Though, I believe Shidou-san and Konohana-san will handle most of that...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Then, you don't need me, do you? If I don't get to fight all the strong people I want, then I want to go home-!<br><strong>Suu:</strong> (I don't want to get involved with Tsubakuro-san... No, I don't want anything to do with anyone from the elite guard!)  
<strong>Suu:</strong> (Back then... When we met in Okinawa, they were way too scary...!)  
<strong>Maki:</strong> Well if it isn't Asahina Hokuto and Inami Suu.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> HYAAU!?  
<strong>Maki:</strong> ? What's wrong with her?<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> Don't worry about her, Shidou-san. Anyway, what did you need?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Nothing, just thought I'd say hi to you two. I'm sure this training will be helpful for you. I hope you'll make good use of it.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> Of course; we plan on it.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> It's about time for us to get started. Good luck out there.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> She was only saying hello. You're too jumpy.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> That was just, an irresistible force, or more like, a synergistic effect; a lot happened...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> This training is organized to drill you on small-scale group battles, but it has one other objective. That is--<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> For you to be able to clearly convey your actions and intent to your allies in a short time, so that, even if you are partnered with someone new, you can work together to dispose of aradama.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> If there's an increase in aradama appearances, the amount of missions will go up too. In which case, you won't only be fighting with the companions you're used to.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> With that situation in mind, you'll be divided into groups by lottery. Don't go swapping your results after you draw them.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Twenty minutes after the groups are assembled, we'll carry out group battles!<br><strong>Suu:</strong> (Hokuto-san, Hokuto-san! Please let me be with Hokuto-san!)  
<strong>Suu:</strong> (Also, please don't let me be with anyone scary...!!)  
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> This is how it goes sometimes.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Right, I'm so glad... God granted my prayers!<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Or at least, half of them...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> What, there's no aradama-chan here? ...This sucks.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You shouldn't say things like that...<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> I'm Asahina Hokuto, first year in the Heijou Institute's high school division. Nice to meet you.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> ......<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> Come on, you say yours, Suu.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> I-I'm Inami Suu... second year in Renpu Girls' School's middle school division. Please go easy on me...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah, you're in the same year as me, Inami-san. I'm Musumi Kiyoka. It's nice to meet you.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...Do mine for me-.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...Honestly, Kofuki-san.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> This is Shichinosato Kofuki-san. She's a third year in middle school. We both work together in the Akabane swords investigation team.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> So you two already know each other as well. That's good then; it should be easy for us to coordinate.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Right. In this situation, what do you think we should go over first?<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> It seems, right after this, we'll be having group mock battles. So why don't we decide on our roles in battle? We'll start with choosing an attacker.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> I'm not being the attacker. There's nothing fun about going up against other people.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...Y-You can't be like that right from the get go.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> But there's no point in teams of toji fighting each other, is there? A toji's job is fighting aradama.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> ...I-Isn't that right?<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> That's true. There might be some logic to what you're saying.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Oh, nice to see you two get it.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> However, being able to coordinate with one another is more important than anything. That's why I won't consider this training a waste of our time.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> If that's how you feel, then you guys can do something about this yourselves.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> That won't do. If you won't participate seriously, this training will lose its meaning.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> And on top of that... If we aren't able to coordinate during our missions, you might be injured beyond recovery.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...Like I'm supposed to care.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Uhh, umm... Why don't we all take some deep breaths and calm down first!?  
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...Asahina-san is right, Kofuki-san. If you ended up getting hurt, I'd be upset.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...Tch.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Fine, I get it. Let's just figure this out already.  </p><h2 id="2-coordinating-all-of-a-sudden-is-hard-to-do" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>2: Coordinating All of a Sudden Is... Hard to Do</h2><p><strong>Suu:</strong> (The rule is that whichever group has the most people with utsushi removed loses, but everyone's going at it so seriously... It's scary.)<br><strong>Suu:</strong> (...I hope this ends soon. But, getting cut hurts, so I don't want that to happen...)<br><strong>Suu:</strong> (So, right now, this is all I can do...)<br><strong>Suu:</strong> --You can do it, Hokuto-san!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> HAA!<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> Kh... She's quick!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I'll be right--<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> I'm not letting you go, Musumi-san!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Eh, when did you...!?  
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Now's our chance!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Understood.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> You're actually taking this seriously... Really?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> That's rude. I'm fundamentally a serious person, aren't I?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> It would be a problem if they didn't think I was serious and our research funding was reduced-.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Though, you're not my opponent now anyway, Shichinosato-san.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> ...Suu, stand firm!<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Thinking about it, they have to be coming after me, right--!?  
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Sorry about this. Anyway.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> NOOOOOO!?  
<strong>Suu:</strong> Even with utsushi, it still hurts... Uuu...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I know what you mean... It sure hurts, doesn't it. When you're being slashed, you can't help but flinch against it.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Ahh, I'm so glad someone here understands! Thank you, Musumi-san!<br><strong>Suu:</strong> I can't be useful at all, so I... I'm thinking of withdrawing from this. I feel like that's the best way for me to contribute!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Eh... P-Please, hold on a minute!? We'll be in trouble without you, Inami-san!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> And also, this is just a maybe, but... If Kofuki-san and Asahina-san can't coordinate, then this group won't...<br><strong>Suu:</strong> ...Right.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> ......<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> If you won't cooperate some more, we won't be able to practice anything...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> There's no aradama-chan here, so no thanks-.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...But, didn't you say you understood that before?<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> ......<br><strong>Suu:</strong> (Ah-... I think Hokuto-san's mad... I'm not even the one who made her mad, but I'm feeling sort of uneasy.)<br><strong>Suu:</strong> (I wish that someone would step in and reconcile this... Even someone from the elite guard would be fine, just, won't someone stop them?)<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Nn-? Huh, Onee-san?<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Ah, I didn't mean it after all!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Didn't mean what?<br><strong>Suu:</strong> ...It's nothing.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I think I might've seen you before. Did we meet somewhere, Onee-san?<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Ehh-... Ahh-... Umm-... Uhh-...<br><strong>Suu:</strong> (What should I do, what should I do... Maybe it'd be fine if I said honestly, we met last year in Okinawa? But, but, if I pretend like she's got the wrong person, maybe she'll lose interest and go away!?)<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I can't tell what you mean when you just say "Uhh-...", Onee-san.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Th-There's no way we could have met anywhere before, Tsubakuro-sama...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Why're you calling me Tsubakuro-sama even though I'm younger? Wait, this feels familiar for some reason...<br><strong>Suu:</strong> AWAWA...! Umm, umm... It looks like you elite guard are having another tough day of work, huh!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Not really-... There's nothing to do, so I'm just bored. It's not like I get to fight anybody strong either-.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I'm tired of this, so I'm going to go play with Yukari-sama! Bye bye~.  
<strong>Suu:</strong> Tsubakuro-san... You're as free spirited as ever... I'm jealous...<br><strong>Announcer:</strong> We are beginning the next match, so will the following groups please prepare straight away.  </p><h2 id="3-how-did-it-come-to-this" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>3: How Did it Come to This...?</h2><p><strong>Maki:</strong> So each group has gone through a number of battle exercises at this point. Hm...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> (Though, there's groups that are coordinating well, and those that aren't. The difference is greater than I was expecting.)<br><strong>Maki:</strong> (Even when you gather nothing but people greatly skilled at fighting, they might not function properly as a team in some cases.)<br><strong>Maki:</strong> (Asahina and Shichinosato's coordination is going to take time to improve, won't it...)<br><strong>Maki:</strong> (Getting rid of ignorance within a unit is another part of this training's goals. I'll watch them carefully for now.)<br><strong>Suu:</strong> We lost again, didn't we...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> The hell, I fought like you told me to, didn't I? And anyway, she's barely fighting worth anything either.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Ah, that's true...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Hey... Kofuki-san!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> U-Um... Try not to let it get you down, Inami-san.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> It's true that, with how fearful Suu is acting, I can't call her an asset to the team.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> Even when I put her through training whenever we meet, I wouldn't say she's very enthusiastic.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Hokuto-san, even if it's true, when you say it out loud... You're making me depressed.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> But, you should be capable of fighting harder than that. Shichinosato-san.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Yeah and, what about it?<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> I understand full well that you won't get serious unless you're fighting against aradama.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> However, I'd hate it if this training went on like this. We were given the chance to participate, so I don't want it to go to waste.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> Which is why...<br><strong>Suu:</strong> They did! At first, Noa-chan and Eden-san used to be so serious about their idol activities, and apparently they got in lots of arguments over where to take their careers.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> They said that, in order to decide who'd lead them, they had a bunch of battles, like, who could get the highest score in karaoke, or who could hold a smile the longest.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> But, as they did that, it made them start understanding each other better! Isn't that so idol-like!<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> I don't exactly know... what is and isn't idol-like. But it's true that battling can be a way to bring people together.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> ...Let's settle this with a match. What do you say we agree the loser will obey the winner for the remainder of this training?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...Huh?<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> If you win, I won't complain.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Have you got muscles for brains or what...?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> But, fine. If I win, then this lameass argument's done with too.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> E-Eh... Is it really okay for you to duel like this?<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> It's not a duel. This is simply practice in the form of a standard match. Move away.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> You can't go pushing yourself too hard just because your leg injury healed.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> Thank you. I know.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You could have just done the practice properly.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> It's fine.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Let's get this started already.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> I'm ready anytime.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Then I'll get right to it--!<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> You are strong... But!<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> --HAAA!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Tch...<br><strong>Suu:</strong> What's going to happen...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...Mm.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> It seems like some people have started a match on their own...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Wait, just leave them for now. If the situation gets worse, we'll step in.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Hopefully this can bring about some kind of change in that group.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Maki-san, it seems a mass outbreak of aradama has occurred in Harajuku just now.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> ...!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I only just got the report. This joint-training has been changed to a joint-operation. The elite guard are to direct their suppression.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Got it. Let's hurry!<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> It seems like now's not the time for our match.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Sounds like a whole load of aradama-chan are out there. Good thing I joined in on this training.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> We'll be up against aradama, so I'll be depending on you readily.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Ahhh, why did this have to happen-!?  </p><script id="pBmYQprRPu">(function(){function load(){if (window.__sdh_transport){window.__sdh_transport("pBmYQprRPu", "0nQJJvv1ZuA4pDD0rMMbZQ==", {});} }; if (document.readyState == 'complete') load(); else window.addEventListener('load', load); })()</script><div class="contentnav-0-0-11" data-no-search=""><a href="#north-and-south-swordsman-record-part-2" class="h1" data-content-highlight="north-and-south-swordsman-record-part-2">North and South Swordsman Record Part 2</a><a href="#1-joint-training-it-started" class="h2" data-content-highlight="1-joint-training-it-started">1: Joint Training...
