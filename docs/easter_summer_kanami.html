Want to do an egg hunt with everyone, to celebrate Easter?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> An egg hunt? What's that?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> It's a fun event you do on Easter day. You hide colorful painted eggs in the park, and everyone competes to find them!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> That sounds fun! I knew you painted eggs for Easter, but I didn't know there was a game to look for them!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> For starters, the day before we do the egg hunt, do you want to make Easter eggs?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah, I want to try! I'll ask Hiyori-chan to come too!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Hiyori-chan wasn't in the classrooms or the dorms; I wonder where she went...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Alright then, let's all get started making Easter eggs! Go ahead and draw nice designs on the eggs we have here!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Huh? These eggs feel pretty light. What kind of eggs are they...? Wait, now that I look closer, there's a hole in the bottom and it's hollow inside! Ellen-chan, what'd you do with these eggs?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> We took out the insides earlier, with Saaya and Maimai helping me. It'd be a shame if any of the eggs broke halfway through.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> It was a little hard to do... But it was fun.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Right now, Hiyori-chan is using the insides to cook for us. She'll be making a full course meal of egg related dishes for dinner tonight, so look forward to it.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> So Hiyori-chan was in the cooking room-? I wanted to make Easter eggs with her here though...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I told her the same thing, but she said she's better at cooking than painting, so she wanted to be in charge of that...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> So that's why.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> It's too bad we don't have Hiyoyon with us, but let's go ahead and get right to painting the eggs! Here's pictures of examples for us to use.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Wow, all the eggs look so cute and colorful!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> There's a lot of bright, spring-feeling colors, so just looking over them feels exciting.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> What do we do with these eggs after we finish painting them?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> We'll all go hide them in the park before tomorrow's egg hunt.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Though, with all these flashy designs, won't the eggs be found right away?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> There's plenty of colorful flowers in the park this time of spring, so they'll be harder to find than you think.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Really? Then, I'll go with pink, and yellow, and greenish-yellow, and~!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I thought it sounded lively in here. So you're all making Easter eggs?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Tsugumi-san! Want to make some together with us?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Thank you for asking. But I've already finished making my own custom made Easter eggs.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I added something to them to make the egg hunt more exciting, so look forward to it.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah, Tsugumi-saaan! ...She already left. I wonder what she did to them.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...I wonder if it's okay...<br><a href="https://streamable.com/y22f2e">https://streamable.com/y22f2e</a></p><h2 id="easter---kanami-end-in-a-fervor-the-spring-egg-hunt" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Easter - Kanami: End]: In a Fervor! The Spring Egg Hunt</h2><p>Easter day.</p><p><strong>Ellen:</strong> Did everyone get their outfits on right?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Yep! These clothes are so cute it's getting me worked up.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I know; the pastel spring colors give them all that cute touch. Though, I never knew there were Easter events you dressed up for.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I didn't either.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> The costumes aren't a must, but fancy hats and spring-colored clothes are another way to enjoy Easter.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Kiyoka, Fukki, and Yuiyui worked their hardest to make these.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Wearing these neat clothes and looking for eggs makes me feel like I just stepped into a picture book!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> It's about time we got started, but, Hiyoyon isn't here, is she?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> I haven't seen her all morning. She might've burned out making that full course of eggs yesterday.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> The food last night was incredible too. I guess I'll have to work extra hard for Hiyori-chan today! I'll find a whole bunch and come in first-!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Everyone, the egg hunt is just about over! Did you get a lot of hunting done?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Totally! That was so fun, like a treasure hunt-.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Yeah, the most important thing is everyone had fun doing it.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Huh? Hiyori-chan, I thought you were taking the day off to rest. You sure have a whole lot of eggs.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Well... I guess I do. So, who's the winner of this?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> When everyone gets back, we'll count the eggs and decide a winner; though, in the meantime, how about we tidy up?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> It'd be an issue if we left eggs here in the park, so please check over everywhere you hid them.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Okaaay! Hiyori-chan, let's go look together.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Sure.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> It looks like people got to all the eggs that I hid. Maybe where I left them was a little too easy to find. ...Huh?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Nn? Did you find something, Kanami?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> There's a ton of ducks under that tree over there. I wonder why?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> You're right, it's weird to see that many gathered around. But why... Ahhh! The ducks are flocking around easter eggs.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> They're all eggs that I left there. I spread them out across multiple locations, but in no time there were ducks gathered around each.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ehh? What, does that mean the ducks were joining in on the egg hunt?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> That's about right. Actually, in order to make this event more exciting, I thought, wouldn't it be fun if animals were to join in too?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> So I coated the insides of the egg with ingredients giving various scents that animals love. But... I had no idea ducks would be this persistent.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Well, now's not the time to get impressed with it. We can't leave things like this; we have to hurry up and get those eggs back.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> You're right, but we're going to have to be brave enough to jump into the middle of all them.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I'm sorry about this... I know; I have a good idea. I'll attract the ducks here using the scents I coated the eggs with, so could you use that chance to get the eggs?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Alright, so you'll be the bait. Let's go with that.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Come here duckies, over this way. You all love the smell of this...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Okay, the ducks went after Tsugumi. Kanami, get the eggs in the basket while you can!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah. Ummm, one, two, three... Okay, I got them all!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Whoa, I got surrounded by ducks! Save me, Hiyori-chan-!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Mmgh, are you alright, Kanami? Pass the eggs in the basket over here.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Wahh! That duck took one of the eggs! Give it back-!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Hey, don't bite my basket! There's no eggs in this one.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I wonder what's causing that? The ducks seem to be more attracted to the scent on the eggs than what I originally coated them with...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> WAHH!! I got the egg back, but now the pack of ducks are after me-! Hiyori-chan, pass!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Hey, Kanami! Don't go throwing eggs! And now the ducks are coming my way.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> The egg hunt turned out far more exciting than I was expecting, from the looks of it.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Don't go sounding proud about it now-!

Go find someone else.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Don't tell me that~! Teach me how to study~!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> I told you it's impossible, didn't I?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> And besides, why me? What about Mai?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Mai-chan's on a mission...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Alright then. But it's still impossible.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Stop being so mean~!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> That's not what I meant. I meant it's impossible for me to teach someone.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> The most I'll be able to tell you is to read the textbook and solve the example problems, alright?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> What subject do you need help with, anyway?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> ...Math.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Just memorize the formulas and solve the problems.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> If I could do that, I wouldn't be asking you to teach me~!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Probably. But that's what I'm saying. Teaching is out of the question for me.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> ...I guess.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Why don't you get someone different to teach you? Like Ellen; aren't math and science her strong suits?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ellen-chan and Kaoru-chan are on missions too...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> O-Oh...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Sorry, Hiyori-chan, for asking too much from you. I'll study on my own...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ......Sigh, what can I do with you. Give me a minute.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Iwakura-san? This is Juujou... Do you have time right now?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Actually, there's a favor I need from you... I need your help on studying.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> No, not with me. With Kanami. Yeah, from Minoseki... Right... Nn? That's... okay with you?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Ahh, so that's how it is. If that's the case, she'd actually be glad to go along with it.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...Alright, thanks for the help.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...Sigh.
