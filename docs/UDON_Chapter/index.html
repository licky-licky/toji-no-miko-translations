Here! It&#x27;s Japan&#x27;s big three udon!<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> Big three udon...!?<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> There&#x27;s no time to waste!!<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> I want to go eat the big three udon!<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> For that cause, since Konohana-san was busy with work, I had Satsuki-san come in her place!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I am Satsuki Yomi, third seat of the elite guard.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> The instructions I received were to treat the Heroes to udon...<br>
<strong>Yuuna:</strong> Yes, I have a question! What are the big three udon?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> There is a wide variety of types of udon.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Among those, the especially famous Sanuki udon, Inaniwa udon, and Mizusawa udon are collectively called the big three udon.<br>
<strong>Itsuki:</strong> What type of udon is it that we usually eat?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Since you are all from Shikoku, if I were to guess, it&#x27;s likely Sanuki udon.<br>
<strong>Tougou:</strong> Sanuki... That&#x27;s right, in the past, Kagawa was once known as the Sanuki Province.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Sanuki udon is very well known, and popular among people across the country.<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> That&#x27;s our udon alright! So then, let&#x27;s start by having some Sanuki udon!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I&#x27;ve procured enough udon for all of you from a local shop famous for their Sanuki udon. Here you are.<br>
<strong>Heroes:</strong> Let&#x27;s give it a try-!<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> [slurrrp]...!? It&#x27;s...<br>
<strong>Karin:</strong> It&#x27;s good, but... Something&#x27;s different, isn&#x27;t it?<br>
<strong>Sonoko:</strong> I think it doesn&#x27;t have enough body to it~?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I think the udon here is plenty delicious, though it may have lost some flavor compared to what you might find in its place of origin.<br>
<strong>Tougou:</strong> What that means is, if we want to eat the true big three udon, we&#x27;ll have to travel to their homelands.<br>
<strong>Yuuna:</strong> Where does Inaniwa udon and Mizusawa udon come from?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Inaniwa udon is from Akita, and Muzusawa udon is from Gunma.<br>
<strong>Yuuna:</strong> Akita? Gunma?<br>
<strong>Tougou:</strong> Regions that once existed in Japan. Akita was in the area known as Tohoku, and Gunma was in the area known as Kanto.<br>
<strong>Yuuna:</strong> Hmmm... I have a feeling we went over that in history class!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> (In history class...? I had been told what to expect, but they really are strange people after all...)<br>
<strong>Sonoko:</strong> We can always eat Sanuki udon when we go back home, but I want to eat Inaniwa udon and Mizusawa udon from their hometowns~!<br>
<strong>Tougou:</strong> You shouldn&#x27;t be so imposing, Sonocchi. We can&#x27;t go all the way to Akita and Gunma only to eat some udon.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> We are working on a strict schedule, but that wouldn&#x27;t be so unreasonable.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> If tomorrow would be fine with you, do you want to go?<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> [SLURRRRRP]! Please take us, Satsuki-san! Tomorrow, the Hero Club sets out on their udon journey!<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> Anyway, we&#x27;ll have to stock up on energy! Let&#x27;s get seconds!<br>
<strong>Itsuki:</strong> Onee-chan, that&#x27;s your third...<br>
The next day, the Heroes and the toji gathered before the break of dawn.</p><p><strong>Yuuna:</strong> Yawn... Morning, everybody! Isn&#x27;t it fun, us all leaving this early! Kind of like a field trip!<br>
<strong>Tougou:</strong> Thinking of breakfast, I borrowed a kitchen and made us some botamochi.<br>
<strong>Tougou:</strong> If anyone wants any, here you are.<br>
<strong>Sonoko:</strong> I do I do~.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Oh! Is it alright for me to have some botamochi too?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> [chew chew]... Mmm, it&#x27;s delicious!<br>
<strong>Tougou:</strong> That golden colored hair, those blue eyes, and... That well pronounced English! Are you perhaps a &quot;westerner&quot;!?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> My mama is American. I&#x27;m Kohagura Ellen, a first year at Osafune Girls&#x27; Academy!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> I wanted to spend some time with you Heroes, so I&#x27;m tagging along on the udon tour! Let&#x27;s have some fun today!<br>
<strong>Tougou:</strong> An American wants to try udon...?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Yes! Udon tastes so good!<br>
<strong>Tougou:</strong> No one who enjoys udon could be a bad person... We&#x27;ll welcome you along, Ellen-san.<br>
<strong>Yuuna:</strong> Udon sure is powerful! It even made Tougou-san fast friends with someone from America!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Is that really something that shocking?<br>
<strong>Yuuna:</strong> It really is! ...Wait, huh? Umm... Who are you?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Juujou Hiyori.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> A friend of mine is from Gunma, but she couldn&#x27;t come today because of a mission, so I came in her place to show you about Mizusawa udon.<br>
<strong>Yuuna:</strong> Yay-, thank you! I&#x27;m so excited to try Mizusawa udon! Nice to meet you, Hiyori-chan!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Y-Yeah...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> (S-Seems like she&#x27;s the type to act close from the moment you first meet...)<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Everyone is here, so let&#x27;s move out. First, in Akita...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Hold on, Satsuki Yomi. The Mizusawa udon place Iwakura-san reccomends closes its doors before noon.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Could we go to Gunma first instead?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> If that&#x27;s the case, then I understand.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Good then. Now I should be able to promote Mizusawa udon like Iwakura-san wanted.<br>
<strong>Yuuna:</strong> If the store closes before noon, then I&#x27;m really looking forward to it!<br>
<strong>Sonoko:</strong> Come on, let&#x27;s go, Gunma!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> From the map she gave me, it should be just ahead... Nn? That&#x27;s weird; it&#x27;s closed.<br>
<strong>Itsuki:</strong> There&#x27;s a sign up. &quot;As we can&#x27;t restock, the store is temporarily closed&quot;... Ehh!?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> You say there&#x27;s... an aradama infestation at the local spring?<br>
<strong>Mizusawa Udon Seller:</strong> That&#x27;s right...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Without being able to get your usual springwater, you can&#x27;t open shop then, can you...<br>
<strong>Yuuna:</strong> I won&#x27;t let them get away with causing trouble for someone selling udon! That&#x27;s too mean!!<br>
<strong>Mizusawa Udon Seller:</strong> I&#x27;m begging you, please do something about those aradama! If I can just get a hold of that water... I&#x27;ll treat you to the ultimate Mizusawa udon!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> What should we do?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> The mission I was given was to escort the Heroes on their udon tour.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> And, as toji, suppressing aradama is our duty.<br>
<strong>Karin:</strong> There&#x27;s no reason to think any harder about it then.<br>
<strong>Yuuna:</strong> That&#x27;s right! As Heroes, we can&#x27;t ignore these aradama causing problems for everyone either!<br>
<strong>Tougou:</strong> We&#x27;ll defeat the aradama to bring back the Mizusawa udon. And then we can eat it. It&#x27;s two birds with one stone.<br>
<strong>Itsuki:</strong> After coming all this way, you can&#x27;t help but be hungry for Mizusawa udon, can you!<br>
<strong>Sonoko:</strong> Let&#x27;s stop the aradama and get back the spring~!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="2-gunma-the-ultimate-mizusawa-udon"></a>2: Gunma: The Ultimate Mizusawa Udon<a class="hash-link" href="#2-gunma-the-ultimate-mizusawa-udon" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Yuuna:</strong> Alriiight! Let&#x27;s go stop those aradama! We&#x27;re going to have that Mizusawa udon for sure-!<br>
<strong>Heroes:</strong> Yeah-!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> You Heroes sure do love udon, don&#x27;t you. Is there some special reason for that?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Don&#x27;t tell me, is udon the source of your hero power!?<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> That&#x27;s not completely off the mark, in the sense that we grew up eating udon...<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> The source of our hero power... That would be udon and the girl power hidden deep in our hearts!<br>
<strong>Tougou:</strong> It&#x27;s Fuu-senpai&#x27;s pet theory that udon will raise your girl power.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Girl power... I see! That must be why you&#x27;re all so cute!<br>
<strong>Yuuna:</strong> Hey, Hiyori-chan, what&#x27;s Mizusawa udon like?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> What makes Mizusawa udon distinct is its pale white noodles. They&#x27;re usually served as chilled zaru udon, but the dipping sauce will depend on where you eat it... Or so I hear.<br>
<strong>Sonoko:</strong> Pale white noodles, hmm. This udon sounds like a real beauty~.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> And also, compared to your average udon noodles, it&#x27;s supposed to be a little bit thicker.<br>
<strong>Itsuki:</strong> If the noodles are thick, then it should already have plenty of body to it.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Ah, about that, I was told it&#x27;s not as if the noodles have more body than Sanuki udon.<br>
<strong>Karin:</strong> Hiyori, why do you keep saying &quot;supposed to be&quot; or &quot;I was told&quot; and that sort of thing?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> I&#x27;m only passing on the information from a friend of mine who loves Mizusawa udon.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> I don&#x27;t know much about Mizusawa udon either. So I&#x27;m looking forward to it too.<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> If that&#x27;s how it is, let&#x27;s beat up those aradama and get some udon ASAP!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I&#x27;ve sighted the aradama. Are you prepared for battle?<br>
<strong>Yuuna:</strong> I&#x27;m ready anytime!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Then, let&#x27;s begin.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Now, as the spring has been safely recovered, the Mizusawa udon has been prepared.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Here you are, everyone. Let&#x27;s begin eating.<br>
<strong>Everyone:</strong> Let&#x27;s eat-!<br>
<strong>Yuuna:</strong> It&#x27;s just like Hiyori-chan told us; these noodles are so pretty!<br>
<strong>Sonoko:</strong> I know~! And this udon is so good it holds up to our udon back home~!<br>
<strong>Tougou:</strong> The noodles aren&#x27;t quite as thick as I was expecting, so it&#x27;s easy to eat.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> It&#x27;s delicious!<br>
<strong>Karin:</strong> This sesame sauce pairs with it pretty well too.<br>
<strong>Itsuki:</strong> Yes! It tastes very good!<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> [slurrrp]-! These cold noodles go down easy after all the exercise we just did!<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> I&#x27;ll have another!<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> [slurrrp]-!<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> With the way the taste changes, between this slightly sweet sesame sauce and the soy sauce, I feel like I could eat as many bowls as they put in front of me!<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> I&#x27;ll have another!<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> [slurrrp]-!<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> Good thing they have this tempura here as a palate cleanser! It helps reset the appetite!<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> I&#x27;ll have another!<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> I&#x27;ll have another!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Y-You&#x27;re going to keep on eating...? Where are the noodles disappearing to?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Maybe they&#x27;re being converted into hero energy?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Either way, she has such a healthy appetite! She&#x27;s a big eating fighter!<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> [slurrrp]-! Another!<br>
<strong>Itsuki:</strong> I&#x27;m sorry about her, Onee-chan is just...  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="3-akita-the-supreme-inaniwa-udon"></a>3: Akita: The Supreme Inaniwa Udon<a class="hash-link" href="#3-akita-the-supreme-inaniwa-udon" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Yomi:</strong> Next is Inaniwa udon. Our destination is Akita.<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> The taste of Mizusawa udon totally lived up to the name of Japan&#x27;s big three udon. I can&#x27;t wait to try Inaniwa udon too!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> After that many extra helpings, you can still fit in more... That&#x27;s really something.<br>
<strong>Itsuki:</strong> What is Inaniwa udon like?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> From your perspective, Inaniwa udon will be a thin type of udon.<br>
<strong>Tougou:</strong> Thin? Do you mean like somen?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes, it would be fine to think like that. It is a type of udon just thicker than somen.<br>
<strong>Sonoko:</strong> A thin type of udon... An unknown type of udon just entered the picture~.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I&#x27;ve made a reservation at the restaurant.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I can assure you the taste will be delicious, so please look forward to it.<br>
<strong>Yuuna:</strong> So it gets Satsuki-san&#x27;s seal of approval! How soon before we get to Akita!<br>
<strong>Karin:</strong> Just hope the place wasn&#x27;t shut down by aradama again.<br>
<strong>Tougou:</strong> Fufu, something like that wouldn&#x27;t happen twice in a row.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Hello. We have a reservation, under Satsuki.<br>
<strong>Inaniwa Udon Restaurant Clerk:</strong> You must be Miss Satsuki then. I apologize, but... Speaking honestly, it seems aradama have appeared along our transport route, and we&#x27;ve been unable to restock...<br>
<strong>Karin:</strong> Ehhh!? This again!?<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> Geez, this is all your fault, Karin. You had to go and put up that weird flag.<br>
<strong>Karin:</strong> What do you mean, flag!?<br>
<strong>Itsuki:</strong> Still... Why are all these udon related places being affected by aradama?<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> The aradama just don&#x27;t understand the deliciousness of udon... That&#x27;s why they&#x27;re making trouble for anyone selling it!<br>
<strong>Sonoko:</strong> The enemies that come out in our world, the vertex, I&#x27;ve heard they&#x27;ll completely ignore a bowl of udon too~.<br>
<strong>Sonoko:</strong> Aradama and vertex; something so inhuman can never understand the greatness of udon~!<br>
<strong>Yuuna:</strong> If only they could tell how delicious udon is, we might be able to come to terms with each other...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Uh, I don&#x27;t think udon is going to help us reach a mutual understanding...<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> Anyway, just like in Gunma, all we have to do is stop the aradama, right?<br>
<strong>Inaniwa Udon Restaurant Clerk:</strong> I-If you would! Once we can restock, then we could prepare for you a supreme Inaniwa udon!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Yes! Let&#x27;s defeat the aradama and have some tasty Inaniwa udon!<br>
<strong>Heroes:</strong> Yeah-!<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> We&#x27;ve been chasing the aradama for so long the sun&#x27;s completely set.<br>
<strong>Itsuki:</strong> We&#x27;re on a straight trip, so it was bound to happen.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Come to think of it, I haven&#x27;t seen Satsuki Yomi for a while.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Oh, really? Where could she have gone off to?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Did she get lost!? That&#x27;s dangerous; we have to go look for her!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Satsuki Yomi is a member of the elite guard. I don&#x27;t think we need to worry about her at all...<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> My girl power is calling out to me...<br>
<strong>Karin:</strong> That&#x27;s just your stomach growling.<br>
<strong>Yuuna:</strong> But, aren&#x27;t you feeling hungry by now?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> In that case, have some omusubi.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Satsuki Yomi!?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Where did you go?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I thought you would all be hungry on this lengthy mission, so while suppressing the aradama, I stopped to procure us food. I bought them somewhere I regularly get omusubi from.<br>
<strong>Sonoko:</strong> These are! Such nice omusubi! The rice is glistening~!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I will vouch for their taste.<br>
<strong>Itsuki:</strong> Ah... This is some tasty rice.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Thank you.<br>
<strong>Karin:</strong> The more you chew it, the sweeter it gets... Mm, the saltiness is good enough on its own.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> You&#x27;re very familiar with this, Miyoshi-san.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> You should have some too, Juujou-san, Kohagura-san.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Thanks... Mm, it is good.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> I&#x27;m back at 100%! Let&#x27;s beat these aradama quick and reclaim that Inaniwa udon!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> You did good work today, everyone. Now then... Let&#x27;s eat.<br>
<strong>Everyone:</strong> Let&#x27;s eat-!<br>
<strong>Yuuna:</strong> Look, Tougou-san! It&#x27;s completely different from how our udon is!<br>
<strong>Tougou:</strong> It really is like somen noodles. But, the taste... It tastes properly like udon.<br>
<strong>Sonoko:</strong> It&#x27;s different from the udon we&#x27;re used to, but this is tasty too~!<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> Since the noodles are this thin, no matter how much you eat, it has to be low-calorie for sure. It&#x27;s very healthy!<br>
<strong>Itsuki:</strong> I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s right, Onee-chan...<br>
<strong>Karin:</strong> Each of the big three udon tasted good, didn&#x27;t they.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> About that... Sanuki and Inaniwa are considered staples of the big three, but there are actually many candidates for the third position.<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> Eh!?<br>
<strong>Yuuna:</strong> If there&#x27;s that many candidates, that means there&#x27;s that many kinds of tasty udon!? Nnn, I want to try them!<br>
<strong>Itsuki:</strong> But, after today, we&#x27;re all full...<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> Okay-, after we get back to Kamakura, we can look up other big three udon candidates and start preparing for our next udon tour!<br>
<strong>Heroes:</strong> Yeah-!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> There&#x27;s just no limit to your passion for udon, is there...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> It is the source of their power, after all!  </p><div class="videoWrapper"><iframe width="640" height="480" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vm_3KVXqxvE"></iframe></div><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="yuusha-2-hiyori-start-toji-and-heroes---the-stoic-pair"></a>[Yuusha 2: Hiyori: Start]: Toji and Heroes-- The Stoic Pair<a class="hash-link" href="#yuusha-2-hiyori-start-toji-and-heroes---the-stoic-pair" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Sonoko:</strong> We&#x27;ll see you off from here~.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Hiyori-chan, I know your aradama mission with Karin-chan will be a bit of a long trip, but do what you can.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Sure, you don&#x27;t have to worry.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I wanted to come along, to see more of Karin-chan&#x27;s dual wielding, but it was too much when I have a mission of my own. That&#x27;s a little disappointing.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> As always... You act the same towards everyone when swordfighting is involved. Well, that&#x27;s how you are.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I mean, she can dual wield, can&#x27;t she? Yukari-sama and Shichinosato-san can do it too, but it&#x27;s not something you get to see all that often, is it?<br>
<strong>Sonoko:</strong> Nibosshi, you get along with her without fighting, okay-? Also, here&#x27;s 500 yen for snacks.<br>
<strong>Karin:</strong> Am I going on a field trip!? What if they think us Heroes can&#x27;t take things seriously!<br>
<strong>Sonoko:</strong> For your snacks-- Don&#x27;t you think it would be best to re-energize with some sugar when you get a break? And also, Niboshi don&#x27;t count as snacks, so don&#x27;t worry about that~.<br>
<strong>Karin:</strong> Of course they don&#x27;t. Niboshi form a complete diet.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> (...Niboshi? Niboshi, huh.)<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Anyway, we should leave.<br>
<strong>Karin:</strong> That&#x27;s right, we won&#x27;t get anything done waiting around here talking.<br>
<strong>Kanami/Sonoko:</strong> Have a safe trip-!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Karin:</strong> .....<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> (At times like these, the sensible thing to do would be to find something to talk about, wouldn&#x27;t it?)<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> (In that case... Alright.)<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...Hey.<br>
<strong>Karin:</strong> ...Hey.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Ah, oh. You can go ahead, Karin.<br>
<strong>Karin:</strong> I wasn&#x27;t going to say anything important. You can say what you were going to first.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Alright.... Well, let&#x27;s work together today. I&#x27;ve seen the way you fight, so I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll have anything to worry about.<br>
<strong>Karin:</strong> I made up my mind to help out, and I&#x27;ll see it through. You can rely on me.<br>
<strong>Karin:</strong> It&#x27;ll depend on how many aradama there are, but what if I soften them up, and you finish them off? That should be the most efficient course of action.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> That should be fine. I was thinking of following the same plan once we got to the site.<br>
<strong>Karin:</strong> That&#x27;s good then.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> What were you about to say before?<br>
<strong>Karin:</strong> Would it be difficult to completely and fully eliminate all the aradama?<br>
<strong>Karin:</strong> There are people living in the town. And aradama appear there... No matter how you look at it, they&#x27;re living right next door to danger.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> If we could do that, that would be for the best. Though, unfortunately, we still haven&#x27;t found an effective way of doing that.<br>
<strong>Karin:</strong> ...So if it were possible, you would have surely done it long ago. Sorry for asking something strange.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> No, I don&#x27;t mind.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> You&#x27;re a... You&#x27;re a kind person, Karin. Without a second thought, you&#x27;re worried for the people in our world too. Though, everyone in the Hero Club seems that way.<br>
<strong>Karin:</strong> I-Isn&#x27;t that just normal...? That kind of attitude. All of you too, if you came to our world and had the strength to fight our enemies, you&#x27;d do it, wouldn&#x27;t you?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> That&#x27;s true. I&#x27;d hope so.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="yuusha-2-hiyori-end-niboshi-and-chocolate-mint"></a>[Yuusha 2: Hiyori: End]: Niboshi and Chocolate Mint<a class="hash-link" href="#yuusha-2-hiyori-end-niboshi-and-chocolate-mint" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Karin:</strong> TORYAAA-! --HAAH!<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> AAAAaaaa...<br>
<strong>Karin:</strong> Now, Hiyori!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Right! --HAAAAHH!<br>
<strong>Karin:</strong> There don&#x27;t seem to be any more aradama in sight for now, but what do you think?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Judging from the report, there should be a few more of them, but we don&#x27;t seem likely to make contact with any more around here.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Why don&#x27;t we move positions some while keeping on the alert.<br>
<strong>Karin:</strong> Alright. We should rehydrate now, while we have the opportunity.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Good idea. [gulp gulp]...<br>
<strong>Karin:</strong> I&#x27;ll take some supplements too...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> !?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> (Just how many does she have!?)<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...Hey, why are you taking so many supplements?<br>
<strong>Karin:</strong> It&#x27;s a part of keeping my body in healthy condition, of course. If I were getting sick often, I wouldn&#x27;t be able to function as a Hero.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> You have a point, but can&#x27;t you get the nutrition you need from proper meals?<br>
<strong>Karin:</strong> ...I do eat proper meals too, whenever possible. [crunch crunch]...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...And after supplements, you pull out niboshi.<br>
<strong>Karin:</strong> You see, niboshi doesn&#x27;t just give you calcium, but also a whole host of vitamins, DPA, and EHA.<br>
<strong>Karin:</strong> And, since all the varieties of niboshi means you&#x27;ll never get tired of it, it wouldn&#x27;t be unreasonable to call it the perfect food.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> You like niboshi, huh. So that&#x27;s why they called you &quot;Nibosshi&quot;.<br>
<strong>Karin:</strong> Sonoko&#x27;s the only one who calls me that, okay...!<br>
<strong>Karin:</strong> Here, do you want some too?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> I guess I&#x27;ll have some. Prioritizing your health is just as important for a toji.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> [crunch crunch]... These are good.<br>
<strong>Karin:</strong> Aren&#x27;t they? I&#x27;m glad I got paired with someone who can understand the quality of niboshi.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> I do like Japanese foods. I eat niboshi too, from time to time.<br>
<strong>Karin:</strong> What&#x27;s your favorite food, Hiyori?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> That would be nimono, and... Chocolate mint.<br>
<strong>Karin:</strong> You said you liked Japanese foods... I didn&#x27;t expect to hear chocolate mint from you.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Karin:</strong> If you think up a type of chocolate mint you&#x27;d recommend, then let me know. I want to try it. Before I go back to our world.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ! Sure, you can look forward to it!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...Sorry, I didn&#x27;t mean to raise my voice just now.<br>
<strong>Karin:</strong> Hiyori... You love chocolate mint a lot, don&#x27;t you.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> I-I won&#x27;t deny that. Anyway, let&#x27;s go look for the rest of the aradama.<br>
<strong>Karin:</strong> This one is a bit bigger and more of a handful... But, with Hiyori and I, we can manage!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> --This is the finish!<br>
<strong>Karin:</strong> Was that the last one?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Yeah. We finished suppressing the aradama sooner than scheduled. Thanks; it&#x27;s because I had your help.<br>
<strong>Karin:</strong> It wasn&#x27;t any trouble for me to come along.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> This one&#x27;s only chocolate mint flavor convenience store ice cream, but it&#x27;s pretty good.<br>
<strong>Karin:</strong> I&#x27;ll have some then. ...Nn!<br>
<strong>Karin:</strong> No wonder you recommended this; this is great.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> That&#x27;s good to hear... Sometimes, you get someone making senseless comments like &quot;chocolate mint is toothpaste&quot;.<br>
<strong>Karin:</strong> Isn&#x27;t that because toothpaste is just mint flavored, and not that chocolate mint tastes like toothpaste?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> You got it, you really get it. It&#x27;s such a relief you&#x27;re one of the ones who understands, Karin.<br>
<strong>Karin:</strong> It&#x27;s not that big a deal. Come on, we should head back soon.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> That&#x27;s true. I still have plenty more to recommend you. I&#x27;ll give you the rest of them on the train.<br>
<strong>Karin:</strong> Hey... They aren&#x27;t all chocolate mint, are they?  </p><div class="videoWrapper"><iframe width="640" height="480" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/H9uezyeVchU"></iframe></div><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="yuusha-2-kiyoka-start-to-boost-up-our-girl-power"></a>[Yuusha 2: Kiyoka: Start]: To Boost Up Our Girl Power!<a class="hash-link" href="#yuusha-2-kiyoka-start-to-boost-up-our-girl-power" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> This time, the two of us will be suppressing aradama as a pair. You might not be able to rely on me for much... But I look forward to working with you.<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> That&#x27;s not true at all. I&#x27;ll be counting on you, Kiyoka.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> (Th-That&#x27;s right. A hero like Fuu-san might be helping to clear out the aradama... But this is where a toji like me needs to get it together...!)<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Umm... Then, let&#x27;s give it everything we&#x27;ve got, Fuu-san!<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> Are you maybe feeling a bit nervous today?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah... No, it&#x27;s not like that!<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> Then, that&#x27;s fine, but it&#x27;s not good for you to go all out all the time, alright?<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> If you can&#x27;t show your strength when it counts, you&#x27;ll be in trouble, won&#x27;t you?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You&#x27;re right about that. To tell the truth... I was feeling like I had to try even harder than usual.<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> That feeling&#x27;s important too. There&#x27;s not a single thing wrong with feeling that way.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> How is it you can be so calm, Fuu-san? You&#x27;re going through so much trouble, coming to our world and then helping us fight aradama, and yet...<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> It&#x27;s because I&#x27;m the leader of the Hero Club. Who&#x27;s going to follow me if I don&#x27;t take everything in stride?<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> Though it&#x27;s not really like that. It&#x27;s hard for me to put in words, but, well... We&#x27;re the ones who decided to help out defeating the aradama, and we know we can trust you toji.<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> Anyway, if things get bad, I can just weaken the aradama with my overflowing girl power, so I&#x27;ll be counting on you to finish them off, Kiyoka.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Your overflowing... Girl power!<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> GUGGGGGIIII...!!<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> Ah, there they are!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Let&#x27;s go, Fuu-san!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...And so that&#x27;s what happened. She was a big help, getting me over my strange nervousness and finishing up our mission.<br>
<strong>Itsuki:</strong> Onee-chan is good at picking up on things like that.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Fuu-san has a strong sense of leadership, doesn&#x27;t she. It&#x27;s a different from Mirja-san, but I found myself depending on her before I knew it.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> On top of that, she&#x27;s so cool and feminine.<br>
<strong>Itsuki:</strong> Hmmm... I feel like you&#x27;re the more feminine one, Kiyoka-san. You know so much about fashion, and the way you accessorize is cute too.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I&#x27;m not that... I still have a long ways to go. I also heard about Fuu-san that her cooking is her specialty.<br>
<strong>Itsuki:</strong> Onee-chan&#x27;s cooking is delicious. She does all the chores around home too.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> She&#x27;s incredible... I really look up to her. I might&#x27;ve wanted to have a big sister like that myself.<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> What do you think, Itsuki? About your reliable big sister you&#x27;re so proud of.<br>
<strong>Itsuki:</strong> Come on, Onee-chan. You&#x27;re letting it go to your head.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Fuu-san!<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> Ah, sorry for getting caught up in the moment.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I... I want to learn to be as feminine as you are, Fuu-san! Could I ask you to give me special training to raise my girl power...!?<br>
<strong>Itsuki:</strong> Ehh...!? Um, Kiyoka-san... I think it would be best if you didn&#x27;t go there. About Oee-chan&#x27;s... girl power...<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> I hear your request loud and clear. I don&#x27;t know how long it will take, but I&#x27;ll do all I can to help boost your girl power, Kiyoka!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah, thank you very much... Fuu-san!<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> The road to improving your girl power is steep and perilous. We&#x27;ll start your training straight away, Kiyoka!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Okay!<br>
<strong>Itsuki:</strong> Th-They&#x27;ll be fine... Probably?  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="yuusha-2-kiyoka-end-the-key-to-raising-ones-girl-power-is"></a>[Yuusha 2: Kiyoka: End]: The Key to Raising One&#x27;s Girl Power is...<a class="hash-link" href="#yuusha-2-kiyoka-end-the-key-to-raising-ones-girl-power-is" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Tougou:</strong> Hey, Itsuki-chan? We just ate a little while ago, so why are Fuu-senpai and Kiyoka-chan sitting in front of bowls of udon?<br>
<strong>Itsuki:</strong> That&#x27;s because...<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> There&#x27;s lots of things that can boost your girl power, like practicing cooking and stuff, but the most effective method is udon!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Udon!?<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> That&#x27;s right. Udon is packed with all the ingredients you need for girl power! And-, with enough girl power, you can do anything-!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I-I got it!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> (I don&#x27;t exactly understand... why eating udon is meant to make you more feminine. But I just have to have faith in Fuu-san for now.)<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> Now, eat up the udon that&#x27;s loved by all across the nation, and raise up your girl power!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Udon is loved on that kind of level in the world you came from!?<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> Sure; udon is at the very tip top of gourmet food. Come on, while it&#x27;s still hot!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I-I&#x27;ll give it a try...!<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> [chew chew]... Even in this world, udon&#x27;s still the best! ...It&#x27;s filling me up!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Yes... It&#x27;s very tasty, isn&#x27;t it!<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> I think I&#x27;ll just keep going on into seconds...?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> [chew chew]... A-Already!? I-I have to... try harder too-!<br>
<strong>Tougou:</strong> Ahh... You can&#x27;t do that, Kiyoka-chan. If you try to have as many helpings as Fuu-senpai...<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> Thank you for coming along to the Inubouzaki Fuu-style Girl Power Boosting Special Training.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I&#x27;m sorry, but... Fuu-san? We ate udon and then exercised together, but I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;ve gotten any more girl power yet...<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> Girl power is something that exudes on its own. You might not feel it right away, but when you do, you&#x27;ll know for sure it&#x27;s gone up. Believe you me!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Girl power exudes on its own... You sure know your stuff, Fuu-san.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I understand then! Now, let&#x27;s go and do a good job of suppressing aradama again today.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah! There&#x27;s a big park nearby here. I don&#x27;t want to let the aradama come near it.<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> Of course. We wouldn&#x27;t want anyone to get hurt.<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> Kiyoka! I drove it over your way! I&#x27;m counting on you!<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> ...!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> --HAAA!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> The readings from aradama in the area are gone. It seems like that was the last one.<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> Nice job-. Toji sure are something else. You had my eyes glued to the way you were handling that sword of yours.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It&#x27;s just really easy to coordinate with you, Fuu-san. So, I sort of feel like I should be thanking you.<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> You don&#x27;t have to thank me or anything. You&#x27;re already doing a lot for us. Ah, actually, mind if we stop by somewhere for a bit?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Wow... It&#x27;s so pretty here. I&#x27;ve never been to this park before.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It&#x27;s a good thing we stopped the aradama from running amok here.<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> That&#x27;s for sure-. That&#x27;s another thing you worked hard for, Kiyoka.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That&#x27;s not true... It wasn&#x27;t just because of me.<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> You can&#x27;t deny you&#x27;re the one who defeated all those aradama today, can you?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Somehow, I just felt a little less hesitant today with my swordsmanship.<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> Fu fu fu, don&#x27;t you get it? That&#x27;s the proof of your girl power.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It is!?<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> Yep. Now that your girl power&#x27;s gone up, I&#x27;m sure you won&#x27;t lose to any aradama. Be confident in yourself, Kiyoka.<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> A girl full of confidence is the strongest there is.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Now that you mention it, attractive girls always seem to have a lot of confidence, don&#x27;t they.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Thank you for all you&#x27;ve done for me, Fuu-san.<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> Hm? What do you mean?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You gave me all that encouragement to help me feel confident in myself.<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> Ahaha-, you noticed, huh?<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> (She caught my interest for some reason, so I might&#x27;ve gone overboard with getting in her business.)<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> Did I overdo it a little?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Fufu, only when you made girl power sound so all powerful. But, I was very glad for your help.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I think I&#x27;ll keep working towards bringing up my girl power from now on!<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> Mmhm. That&#x27;s the spirit. You can do it, Kiyoka!</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations/edit/docs/UDON_Chapter.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_2_ui" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_3DPF"></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"></div></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_35-E thin-scrollbar"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#1-the-hero-clubs-udon-trip" class="table-of-contents__link">1: The Hero Club&#39;s Udon Trip</a></li><li><a href="#2-gunma-the-ultimate-mizusawa-udon" class="table-of-contents__link">2: Gunma: The Ultimate Mizusawa Udon</a></li><li><a href="#3-akita-the-supreme-inaniwa-udon" class="table-of-contents__link">3: Akita: The Supreme Inaniwa Udon</a></li><li><a href="#yuusha-2-hiyori-start-toji-and-heroes---the-stoic-pair" class="table-of-contents__link">Yuusha 2: Hiyori: Start: Toji and Heroes-- The Stoic Pair</a></li><li><a href="#yuusha-2-hiyori-end-niboshi-and-chocolate-mint" class="table-of-contents__link">Yuusha 2: Hiyori: End: Niboshi and Chocolate Mint</a></li><li><a href="#yuusha-2-kiyoka-start-to-boost-up-our-girl-power" class="table-of-contents__link">Yuusha 2: Kiyoka: Start: To Boost Up Our Girl Power!</a></li><li><a href="#yuusha-2-kiyoka-end-the-key-to-raising-ones-girl-power-is" class="table-of-contents__link">Yuusha 2: Kiyoka: End: The Key to Raising One&#39;s Girl Power is...</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Links</div><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://pastebin.com/LdyviZ8Z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Translator anon&#x27;s pastebin<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Site source code<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Built with Docusaurus.</div></div></div></footer></div>
