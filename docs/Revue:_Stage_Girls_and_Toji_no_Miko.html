a fine arts festival presented through a collaborative effort by the Five Traditions.</p><p><strong>Its main attraction:</strong> a dance performed in miko attire by eleven select toji.<br><strong>This year, the girls chosen were as follows:</strong> Shidou Maki, Konohana Suzuka, Satuki Yomi, Tsubakuro Yume, Etou Kanami, Yanase Mai, Juujou Hiyori, Mashiko Kaoru, Kitora Mirja, Yamashiro Yui, and Shichinosato Kofuki--<br><strong>Maki:</strong> We're going to do a full rehearsal of the performance now. Ban Tsugumi, you're in charge of the music.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Right, you can leave the supporting role to me. Ready... Starting the music.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Three, two, one...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> That's wrong, all wrong! Ban Tsugumi, stop the music! Yume, Mashiko Kaoru, Shichinosato Kofuki!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> You weren't keeping the pace! We're starting again, from the top!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh~, againnn? I'm bored of this already~.  
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> I thought I'd get a break from dealing with aradama here, but this might be worse...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Hey, how long're we gonna keep doing this for? Isn't this good enough already?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Until you can deliver a perfect performance for Yukari-sama, of course.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> That's the entire purpose of this training camp. Now, let's keep going...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Wait, Maki-san. It's about time we gave them a break.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Hooray-! A break-!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Hold it, Yume! I didn't say we were taking a break yet!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Suzuka! They still have a long way to go before they're ready! Do you think we have time to stop now!?  
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> That's exactly why we should.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> This training camp will last quite some time. They'll need a degree of rest every now and then, won't they?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> But...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> We'll still be practicing tomorrow, won't we? Let us rest a minute.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> That's not your place to decide...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> ...Maybe I have been pushing you too hard though.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> We're taking a break, everyone. You can all rest until Yume, Mashiko Kaoru, and Shichinosato Kofuki can manage that performance.<br><strong>Kaoru/Kofuki/Yume:</strong> Ehh~!?  
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ahh, I'm worn out-.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> We've been dancing all this time, after all.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Maybe it's because we're using different muscles than usual, but I'm feeling a lot more tired than I expected.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> This seemed likely to happen, so we do have honey lemon slices prepared. Would you all like some?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Honey lemon slices... That would be nice.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Thank you, Kitora-san!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Yamashiro Yui, please hand them out.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> I'm on it, Mirja-san!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> You can eat these soury sweet honeyed lemons right out of my hands! And you can lick my fingers clean too if you want!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Stop that, it's unsanitary.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Haha... Thank you, Kitora-san. I can make another batch for everyone tomorrow.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Good, I'll tell Ban Tsugumi that she won't need to make any more.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Nn~! Sweet and sour... And bitter!? Eh!? Why's it so bitter!?  
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> What's this powder mixed in with the honey!? Though... I feel like dancing now!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> ...I think I won't eat any after all.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ...That may be for the best.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Tsubakuro-san, you are moving your hands incorrectly. Mashiko-san, your body has stopped moving. Shichinosato-san, please do not try to fall asleep.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...The training camp has only just begun and we're already behind schedule.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> I didn't expect it to be such a struggle. There are lots of minor points they aren't able to keep up with, but...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> It's the finishing act, isn't it.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> As toji, they should all be skilled enough for this.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> And despite that, for them to be this this incapable of coordinating their performance...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> We still have time before the recital. I'd like to believe they can work things out with enough practice.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Why now, at a time like this...<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Shidou-san, there's a report of an aradama outbreak in the area...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> We'll all go. You'll join us, Ban Tsugumi.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> That's fine, but it's best if we go quickly. Tsubakuro-san and Shichinosato-san have already rushed on ahead.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Nice timing back there, aradama-chan! I love you for real-!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I'm glad we got to leave practice, but these are all weaklings, so it's still boring!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> ...By the way, Onee-san. Where are we?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Beats me? All I cared about was chasing down the aradama-chan, so I wasn't paying attention.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh-!? You're no help at all.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Playing with aradama-chan was bound to be a million times more fun than that lameass dance practice.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> ...Found you! Don't go running off on your own!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Is this a theater? Was there a theater this close nearby?<br><strong>Giraffe:</strong> I understand.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Wah-!? A talking giraffe!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Is that an aradama too? Should I cut it up to be sure?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Please wait, Shichinosato-san. I've never seen an aradama with such a close resemblance to a giraffe before.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> We should attempt to gather information on it through communication first. You can cut it up when we're done.<br><strong>Giraffe:</strong> I am not an aradama, so may I ask you toji not to cut me.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> It knows what we are?<br><strong>Giraffe:</strong> Yes.<br><strong>Giraffe:</strong> I wish for you to suppress the aradama, so the audition may resume.  </p><h2 id="2-could-this-be-another-world" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>2: ...Could This Be Another World?</h2><p><strong>Maki:</strong> All aradama in the area have been defeated. Suzuka, is the spectrum finder showing you anything?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...No, that should have been all of them just now. However...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Suzuka? Is something wrong?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> It's not giving any response, Shidou-san. After entering this theater, the spectrum finder didn't react to the aradama at all.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> ...They didn't show up on the spectrum finders?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Yes, this is a highly fascinating phenomenon!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Could they be a new variety of aradama? Though, the structure of their bodies was familiar. Which might mean, the aradama have evolved in some way...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Get a hold of yourself, Ban Tsugumi. ...Suzuka, is what she said accurate?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yes, I've confirmed it myself. Ban-san is telling the truth.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> So what's going on here...?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Maki-onee-san! Somebody's fighting some aradama over there!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Grh, they just keep coming... Move in to help!<br><strong>??? (Karen):</strong> YAAAAAAAHH!!<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> Gyaa...<br><strong>??? (Mahiru):</strong> Wh-What's going on here!?  
<strong>??? (Hikari):</strong> Think about that later. HAA!!<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> GYAAA!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ehhh!?  
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> They're killing aradama without okatana!?  
<strong>Yui:</strong> And they're so cute to boot!?  
<strong>Mirja:</strong> (As it seems, these are not ordinary aradama here... No, that's not what matters most now.)<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> This is no time for you to fool around, Yamashiro Yui! Move to support those girls!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> I dunno who you are, but hands off my aradama-chan!!<br><strong>??? (Karen):</strong> Thanks for the help! Those monster looking things came out of nowhere, and we didn't know what to do!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> We were just doing our job. We're toji, after all.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> And anyway, how'd you beat the aradama!? That's not an okatana, right!?  
<strong>??? (Karen):</strong> Otakara? [treasure]<br><strong>??? (Nana):</strong> Not treasure, Karen-chan. She said an "okatana".<br><strong>??? (Juuna):</strong> An okatana... Some type of sword? Like the ones you have, right?<br><strong>??? (Karen):</strong> Banana! And Junjun too!<br><strong>??? (Mahiru):</strong> Hey, Karen-chan... These girls, they might have something to do with what's happening...<br><strong>??? (Hikari):</strong> I think so too.<br><strong>??? (Karen):</strong> But, since they're here, that makes them stage girls like us!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> ..."Stage girls"?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Like performers? Does anyone know about them?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Nope, not me.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> What about you, Mai-chan?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> No, I haven't heard about them either.<br><strong>??? (Juuna):</strong> We're students of Seisho Music Academy. You've heard of that, right?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Seisho Music Academy? Do you know about it, onee-sans?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> No, I've never heard of it.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I should be familiar with prestigious music academies, from socializing in those circles...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> But the name Seisho Music Academy doesn't ring any bells.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Maybe it's not all that prestigious?<br><strong>??? (Maya):</strong> I'm not about to let that comment pass.<br><strong>Karen:</strong> There's no Starlight-!?  
<strong>Kanami:</strong> What do you mean aradama don't exist!?  
<strong>Claudine:</strong> So, if I'm understanding this correctly, these girls came from another world?<br><strong>Kaoruko:</strong> Could something out of a fairytale like that happen?<br><strong>Futaba:</strong> You fought them yourself, didn't you, Kaoruko? Those, aradama, you called them?<br><strong>Kaoruko:</strong> ...It might have actually happened after all...<br><strong>Kaoruko:</strong> Which all works out then.<br><strong>Kaoruko:</strong> We've been in a pickle. The audition was suspended thanks to these aradama. Could you defeat them for us?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Audition...? I haven't seen any judges here.<br><strong>Juuna:</strong> It's called an audition, but it isn't like any ordinary audition you're thinking of.<br><strong>Juuna:</strong> Stage girls fight amongst each other, aiming to be the top star.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Hmmm. Well, you don't have to ask. I'll get all the aradama-chan myself.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Shichinosato Kofuki is right. Defeating aradama is our duty as toji.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Duty's great and all, but... If we beat them all, is that gonna send us back to our world?<br><strong>Maya:</strong> I believe things will work out.<br><strong>Maya:</strong> The giraffe asked for you to suppress the aradama. So, once they are all suppressed, he should send you back.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Then there shouldn't be a problem. You can leave suppressing the aradama to us.<br><strong>Karen:</strong> ...But, is it really okay for us to make Shidou-san and them do all the work?<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> I feel the same way. It's not like it's the toji's fault the aradama are here...<br><strong>Hikari:</strong> Besides, this is our audition.<br><strong>Maya:</strong> Which leaves us only one option: we will help suppress the aradama too.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> But, it's dangerous!<br><strong>Maya:</strong> Despite not being toji, we can defeat these aradama, can't we? There should be no issue then.  </p><h2 id="3-a-shared-resemblance" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>3: A Shared Resemblance</h2><p><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Shichinosato-san, there's aradama on our 9 o'clock. Did you notice them?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> The hell, what is this place, aradama-chan heaven!? Bring it on! Just try and keep up!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Don't mind me; go all out.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Look at them go-. At this point, can't we just leave everything to those two?<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Nene!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> You know we can't do that! So long as aradama are here, they're causing problems for Karen-chan and the others!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> That's right, Kaoru-chan.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> And besides, if we don't get back soon... I'm sure Sayaka-chan and the others will be worried sick.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Worried, huh...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...You're losing focus, Maki-san.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Does it look that way?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> There's no other way of looking at it. Wouldn't you ordinarily be leading the charge against the aradama?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> But there are three concerns causing you to falter. Will we be able to go home? How is Yukari-sama reacting to this?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> And also... about the dance performance.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> ...I can't hide anything from you, can I.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I'm simply worried about the same things you are.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Since we have this opportunity, I'd like to ask these girls for their opinions on our performance. What do you think?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Ask them?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yes. Their lives revolve around the stage, don't they? They should be able to offer us valuable insights.<br><strong>Maya:</strong> The closing act of your dance isn't coming along well?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> That's right. Aside from the very end, we can bring it together with few mistakes.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> But, no matter how many times we rehearse it, we never manage to synchronize the end.<br><strong>Maya:</strong> ...<br><strong>Claudine:</strong> It isn't as if your bodies stop moving, is it?<br><strong>Claudine:</strong> From watching you fight with the aradama, each of you should have more than enough basic physical fitness, so all that's left is for you to practice.<br><strong>Maya:</strong> ...Are they not losing sight of their direction?<br><strong>Claudine:</strong> What do you mean by that?<br><strong>Maya:</strong> Assuming the toji are also special students, there isn't a chance they would receive an utterly useless curriculum.<br><strong>Maya:</strong> In which case, their dance must also be treated as an extension of their everyday life.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> An extension of our usual life...<br><strong>Maya:</strong> That's right. Shidou-san, you've been attempting to deviate from your ordinary selves, have you not?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> ...You've hit the nail on the head, Tendou Maya.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> In focusing too heavily on acting as miko for our dance, we've lost sight of being toji.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> ...A theater pro really does see things differently. I'm glad I asked you.<br><strong>Claudine:</strong> I could have told you that much...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> (As expected, Tendou-san made a convincing argument. Though... I wonder what has Saijou-san looking so bothered?)<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> (Her hostile attitude toward Tendou-san seems somewhat familiar...)<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Hmmm. Hey, Yomi-onee-san?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> What is it, Tsubakuro-san?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Does Clau-onee-san remind you of anybody? She feels really familiar for some reason...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Oh my, you had the same impression, Yume?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ...That would be Konohana-san, wouldn't it? Though she hasn't acted like that for a long time.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh, Suzuka-onee-san, did you used to be like that?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes. Just like that.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> (...Ahh, so that's what it was.)<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Saijou-san?<br><strong>Claudine:</strong> What? It's true that you need to practice. I haven't said anything wrong either.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...I'm not here about that. It's difficult, isn't it? Following after another.<br><strong>Claudine:</strong> What are you talking about?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> There's someone who's captured your attention, isn't there?<br><strong>Claudine:</strong> ...Not really.<br><strong>Claudine:</strong> There's only someone I'm going to surpass. Without fail.<br><strong>Claudine:</strong> Oh, right, about getting opinions on your performance. Since you have the chance, why not ask all of us?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Of course, we will--<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Shichinosato-san, here comes another wave. We may need to break out the flag for this one. [Referring to a flag Japanese fishermen will hoist after catching a huge haul]<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Was that supposed to be a joke!?  
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> And besides, they're all mine! Nobody's taking them from me!!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Suzuka! Yomi! Yume! We're moving in too!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Understood.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> It's boring fighting these weakling aradama though.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Now that's how Maki-san ought to be.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> You've started acting like an elite guard again.  </p><h2 id="4-the-star-we-sought" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>4: The Star We Sought</h2><p><strong>Mirja:</strong> After all that, it seems the amount of aradama appearing has decreased.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> I think so too, Mirja-san!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> If we keep up the pace, we'll be back home in no time... Wait, we can't!!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> What's wrong with going home?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> You want to stay in this aradama infested theater production from hell forever?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> But still! The lovely ladies from Seisho! I still need to cozy up with them!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...Do you listen to yourself talk?<br><strong>Kaoruko:</strong> Lovely ladies, you say. Well, that's only a natural reaction.<br><strong>Futaba:</strong> Don't flatter yourself.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I get what you mean, Yui-chan.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Kanami-chan! I didn't think I had an ally here!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Everyone from Seisho, their movements are so beautiful. Right down to their fingertips; it's so precise!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> ...That's not the kind of ally I was looking for!<br><strong>Karen:</strong> Stage girls are evolving every day!<br><strong>Karen:</strong> Even when fighting aradama, you can't forget about the stage!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> That's an interesting perspective, Etou Kanami. Unlike Yamashiro Yui's.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Everyone from Seisho acts with such finesse, though their fundamental movements are all different.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Is there something like schools of swordsmanship within theater performance?<br><strong>Hikari:</strong> ...The difference in our fields of expertise?<br><strong>Juuna:</strong> It might be something like that. Isurugi-san, swordfights are your specialty, aren't they?<br><strong>Futaba:</strong> Yeah, I don't plan on letting anyone show me up when it comes to a swordfighting scene.<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> For me, it would be the baton?<br><strong>Nana:</strong> The toji girls are the other way around, right?<br><strong>Nana:</strong> There's differences in the details, but the way they move their whole bodies are all tuned for using a sword.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> The way we move our bodies is tuned for using a sword... You mean our fundamentals are the same?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> ...I wonder if that could help us improve our dance performance?<br><strong>Karen:</strong> Dance performance?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> I'll explain that.<br><strong>Karen:</strong> The toji are dressing up as mikos for a dance!?  
<strong>Junna:</strong> You're all so athletic, so it should be a real show seeing you all moving together.<br><strong>Nana:</strong> Yeah, yeah. I wish I could be there to see it.<br><strong>Karen:</strong> Put on the show for us here!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> If we want your opinions, the best way would be to practice in front of you.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh!? We're doing it now!?  
<strong>Maki:</strong> Tendou Maya. It might still be far from complete, but will you watch our performance?<br><strong>Maya:</strong> That's an important responsibility. Because it's incomplete, that's all the more reason for you to need our opinions.<br><strong>Hikari:</strong> What do you mean?<br><strong>Claudine:</strong> They can't seem to get their closing act to come together.<br><strong>Karen:</strong> Why do you know that, Clau-chan!?  
<strong>Claudine:</strong> I heard it from them earlier. They said they wanted advice on how to improve.<br><strong>Hikari:</strong> ...Why didn't you tell us?<br><strong>Claudine:</strong> We were going to, but then the aradama arrived. Anyway, let's move things along. Start your performance.<br><strong>Karen:</strong> That was so intense!<br><strong>Junna:</strong> Agreed. Getting to see it up close, you get such a sense that those okatana are the real thing.<br><strong>Futaba:</strong> When it comes to the dancing, that's Kaoruko's field, right? You want to help them out?<br><strong>Kaoruko:</strong> You say that, but wasn't that closer to a combat demonstration than a dance?<br><strong>Kaoruko:</strong> I don't have a single bit of advice to offer.<br><strong>Nana:</strong> A combat demonstration... Ah, maybe that's why the just the last part felt different?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> That's it! Please, tell me more! What is our performance missing?<br><strong>Karen:</strong> It's hard to say exactly what... When you're swinging your okatana, it's like it's filled with emotion?<br><strong>Karen:</strong> It's like a real dance performance then.<br><strong>Hikari:</strong> It must be because you have a clear image of a target in mind.<br><strong>Nana:</strong> Aradama, right.<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> So then, why isn't the last part going as well?<br><strong>Claudine:</strong> ...It's because they can't get their mental images aligned, isn't it?<br><strong>Claudine:</strong> Just looking at Maki and Suzuka, there's force behind Maki's movement, but Suzuka's was more delicate, wasn't it?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong>  Delicate? I wasn't intending to restrain myself...<br><strong>Claudine:</strong> I'm only talking about the difference I felt between what you two were picturing. Maki imagined cutting down an aradama, and...<br><strong>Maya:</strong> Konohana-san had returning her sword to its sheath in mind.<br><strong>Claudine:</strong> Well, that's about it.<br><strong>Maki/Suzuka:</strong> ...<br><strong>Junna:</strong> So, to sum it up, at the very end of this dance performance, you can't unify what you're all expressing?<br><strong>Karen:</strong> Yeah! That's it!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Our mental image, huh. I think mine is staying on guard.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I think that's mine too.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> I picture striking down my enemy.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> I imagine ending everything with a big group hug!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Can't we just imagine taking a break, since it's done?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> You two... Are you not going to take this seriously?<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> GGGGAAAAAOOOOOO!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Tch, aradama!?  
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Oh my, and a rather large one at that.<br><strong>Claudine:</strong> C'est pire! ...Could it not have given us a little more time here!?  
<strong>Karen:</strong> Why are you two acting so calm when there's that giant monster aradama!?  
<strong>Maya:</strong> Its size has nothing to do with this. They can at last see their performance taking shape.<br><strong>Maya:</strong> Once this aradama is defeated, their dance can be completed.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Right, so let's go!  </p><h2 id="5-a-time-we-surely-shared" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>5: A Time We Surely Shared</h2><p><strong>Giraffe:</strong> You've done well, toji. The audition will resume.<br><strong>Karen:</strong> If the audition's resuming... That means we took out all the aradama?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Now we can go back home, Hiyori-chan!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...Can we really go back though? I don't even remember how we got here in the first place...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Come to think of it, just how much time has passed since we came here?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> It might be like Urashima Tarou when we get back. [a fairytale about a man who spends time in an underwater kingdom and finds a century has passed when he returns]<br><strong>Karen:</strong> Hey, Kanami-chan and them can get back fine, can't they?<br><strong>Giraffe:</strong> Of course, I will dutifully return them home.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> That's good to hear.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> ...Before we go, could we show you our performance one last time? I want you to see the final act with all of our minds focused on the same mental image.<br><strong>Maya:</strong> We would be glad to.<br><strong>Karen:</strong> Cause we'll get to see an even better performance than before!<br><strong>Hikari:</strong> ...I can't wait.<br><strong>Nana:</strong> And this time, I'll be sure to take some good photos of it.<br><strong>Juuna:</strong> Is there any way we could exchange the pictures?<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> I wonder if we would have time to print it out?<br><strong>Claudine:</strong> Why don't we just test sending it to them now?<br><strong>Futaba:</strong> Test it... Do our phones work the same as theirs?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> They look to be the same. Daiba-san, would you mind sending me the data?<br><strong>Nana:</strong> Sure thing. Here, point your phone this way.<br><strong>Kaoruko:</strong> Anyway, how much time do we have left?<br><strong>Giraffe:</strong> They leave right now.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Right now... Wait, huh? This is, the boarding house...?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> It was a dream?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Was that dream about fighting aradama in an underground theater, by any chance?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I had the same dream too!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Was it a dream?<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Ne-?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Don't tell me... Those theater cuties were all a figment of my imagination!?  
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> No, I don't believe it was a dream.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ah! Suzuka-onee-san! Is that picture the one Banana-onee-san sent you?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> That's right. I still have it, right here. Look.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> The advice they gave us... It won't go to waste.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> First, we're all going to synchronize our mental image of our performance! After that, we're going to practice!<br>On the day the dance performance would be shown to the public.</p><p><strong>Maki:</strong> (Everything's gone well so far... All that's left is the closing act... It'll be fine.)<br><strong>Maki:</strong> (We've shared our mental image, like the stage girls suggested.)<br><strong>Maki:</strong> (All we need is to...!)

Aradama and okatana don't exist...<br><strong>Hikari:</strong> Starlight, which has been performed countless times around the world, doesn't exist...<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> Ah, that reminds me. I wanted to ask you something. Does Suzudaru Cat exist in your world too?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Suzudaru Cat? Hmm, I haven't heard of it. How about you, Kanami-chan?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I've never heard of it either.<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> I don't believe it~... A world without Suzudaru Cat...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> What kind of cat is it?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Hey, hey. What're you talking about?<br><strong>Karen:</strong> Yume-chan, Yomi-chan.

<strong>Yume:</strong> Huhh. So this thing's called Suzudaru Cat?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> It dropped off of an aradama just now.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> An aradama?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> That's Suzudaru Cat...?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Woww... It's too cute, Mahiru-chan! There's this sort of unexplainable charm to it!<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> Isn't there? Suzudaru Cat has that kind of cuteness you just can't describe-!<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> Ahhh, I'm glad I found someone who can understand Suzudaru Cat's greatness~.  
<strong>Karen:</strong> I'm happy for you, Mahiru-chan.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> You like those kind of mascot characters, don't you, Kanami-chan?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah, I love them!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Hey, Tsubakuro-san, Satsuki-san? What was it like when you got that Suzudaru Cat?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Just before the aradama I killed dissappeared, it was like, poof!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I can't say it will be the same for all aradama, but that's what it was like with the one we defeated.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Cool, so while we suppress the aradama, we can also collect a bunch of Suzudaru Cats!<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> Defeating aradama means getting Suzudaru Cats...!<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> Etou-san! If it's alright with you, do you think you could... share some of the Suzudaru Cats you find?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Of course! I'm not about to take them all for myself! Let's share them with everyone! Hiyori-chan, you're fine with that too, right?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> I-I never said I wanted any, did I?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> But they're so cute.

Though it sounds just like something you'd do.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah, Hiyori-chan. What's up?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> What do you mean, "What's up?" You're the one who said to meet here so we can spar now.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Oh yeah! Then, let's get right to it, Hiyori-chan! I'll catch up with you later, Mai-chan~.

Did you need something?<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> Nothing in particular, but I was watching you with Kanami-chan. You seem close.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> We sure are. As soon as we met in middle school, we were fast friends. We often spend time together, in classes and the dorms.<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> Just like Karen-chan and I. Since the start of high school, we've always been together as roommates! Though now there's three of us, since Hikari-chan moved in.<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> What about Hiyori-chan? Her uniform is different, so she's from a different school, isn't she?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> We got to know Hiyori-chan during an incident at the tournament in our second year, and we've been friends ever since.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> It all started with Kanami-chan befriending Hiyori-chan.<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> So that's what happened.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Mai-chaaan, Tsuyuzaki-saaan!

You're incredible, Mahiru-san.<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> It sort of looked like a ball, so I just gave it a good whack on reflex.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> That was only your reflexes...?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> And not just that, but how you casually twirled around that weapon of yours like a baton as you fought...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> The way you moved... I think I could use it as reference in future fights.<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> It's sort of embarrassing hearing you talk like that, Mai-chan.<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> But, would it really be helpful learning from me?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I'd like to give it a try. Will you teach me how?<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> Mmm, but even if I teach you how to twirl a baton, it's not very useful for fighting, is it? I just somehow make it work...<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> I know!
