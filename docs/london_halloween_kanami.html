Oh, it's you, Kanami.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> So you were on this assignment too, Hiyori-chan.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> That's what it looks like.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> For some reason, it feels like it's been a while since I saw you.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> We've both been busy being sent out all over the place.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I'm not as bad as Kaoru-chan, but it makes me want a vacation too.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> A vacation, huh. Seems like that'll be unlikely for a while.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> But, assuming we could get a vacation, what would you want to do?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Hmm... I'd want to go on a trip, I guess?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Going on a trip... That doesn't sound too bad. Would be nice to go to some hot springs and heal off all the daily fatigue.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Where do you want to go, Kanami?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Hmm, let's see. I think I'd like to go on a trip overseas!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Like, to the USA, for example. I'd want Ellen-chan to take me around to all the American dojos!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> American dojos...? Well, that sounds like a trip you'd go on.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I'll bet they feel different from the ones here in Japan, so it'll be fun for sure!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> If you had Ellen with you, it'd probably get that much more noisy.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> And then, I'd want to go to the usual places, like Hawaii, and also, I think I'm interested in going to Europe too!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> To see the dojos there too?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah! I want to check it out! Though, how much western style swordfighting do you think is still around in Europe?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> As far as what level's still in practice... I'm not really sure.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Though, Europe refers to a big place. There's a lot of countries there, you know?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Was there any country you wanted to go visit in particular?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Hmm, I guess I'd have to see England first? I want to go to London!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> London... The most I know about it comes from Sherlock Holmes.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah! Sherlock Holmes! That's good! When we get to London, let's do stuff like Sherlock Holmes!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Wh-What!?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> What do you mean, stuff like Sherlock Holmes!?<br><a href="https://streamable.com/q8wc5e">https://streamable.com/q8wc5e</a></p><h2 id="london---kanami-end-stuff-like-holmes" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[London - Kanami: End]: Stuff Like Holmes...?</h2><p><strong>Kanami:</strong> Phew, we somehow managed to jump across to this trolley, Hiyori-chan.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Right. The jewels we're after are on the inside.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah! But... They're bound to have Scotland Yard's finest on security, so we'd better be careful.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...If you're going to warn me to be careful, try not giggling when you do it.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> But, come on, they're going to have their top class guards stationed in there!?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> What kind of fighting style do you think they'll use? Isn't it exciting, Hiyori-chan!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Now you're saying the polar opposite of before. Weren't we supposed to be careful?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> We'll have fun while we're being careful!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> There's just no helping you, is there... Let's move in!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> I heard a noise over this way! Intruders!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Hopping aboard the car we're guarding; you phantom thieves have run out of luck.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Wait, we're the thieves, not the detectives!?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> See, Hiyori-chan. Holmes is a master of Baritsu, right?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> So I'd want to fight him. Which means, we've gotta be phantom thieves!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> "Gotta be phantom thieves"? Really!? And also, Holmes wasn't even there!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Then maybe... Instead of working together, would it be a better setup if I came to steal you, Hiyori-chan?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> "I've come to steal you away, Hiyori-chan!" Like that.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Are you listening to me!? And anyway, you're the one kidnapping me!?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Would you rather steal me?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Like, "I'm here to steal you away, Kanami."<br><strong>Announcement:</strong> We have confirmed the appearance of aradama. I repeat--<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> --!! Kanami, let's leave this off here!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> It's going to be a long time before we can think about that vacation.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> That's for sure. It's disappointing, but, we won't be able to vacation in peace until the aradama calm down some more.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> I know.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Once things settle down... Let's all go on a trip together.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> When that time comes, I'll go with you wherever, to London or anywhere.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong>　But let's get going, Kanami!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Okay, Hiyori-chan!<br><a href="https://streamable.com/apx74v">https://streamable.com/apx74v</a></p><h2 id="halloween-19---kanami-start-starting-halloween-with-sweet-pie" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Halloween '19 - Kanami: Start]: Starting Halloween with Sweet Pie</h2><p><strong>Kanami:</strong> Mmm, Mai-chan's pumpkin pie is so good~!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I'm glad you like it, Kanami-chan.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Did you bring this pie over to Sayaka-chan and them? She said she was filming a movie with Kitora-san, right?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Apparently the director from that time with the period drama invited them.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Mm-mm, I thought I'd let Sayaka-chan have it after she gets back.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I can be careful, but it would be bad if the pie were damaged on the way.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> That's probably for the best. Ohm... The sweets you make really are delicious, Mai.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Thank you, Hiyori-chan. If you'd like, let's make some together next time.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Alright. I've never made something like this before, but you teaching me would be a good chance to learn. I'll be counting on you.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Sure!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Ah, you three were in here!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Happy Halloween~! Kanami-chan, Hiyori-chan, annnd, Mai-chan! Trick or treat~?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Here, Yui-chan, have a bite of this.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Oh! Did you make this, Mai-chan? I'll have some~. Mmm~, so good!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Yui-chan, were you looking for us for something?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> I'm passing the word on from Kiyoka-chan. The costume party we're having is going to be at an amusement park.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> So, anybody who wants to get seriously dressed up, meet in an hour out in front of school!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ehh, that's so cool! Let's go, Hiyori-chan, Mai-chan!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> We might as well.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> So, when Kiyoka said we could rent our costumes, she meant from the amusement park?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> I've got to make the rounds and let the other girls know, so I'll be seeing you later~.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> And, if you see anybody, be sure to tell them too, okay~?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> We got it-. Thanks, Yui-chan!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> How about we get going then?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah, sure! Though, we still have some time left, so I want to have at least one more slice of pie~.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Of course you can.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> The sweets you make are just addictively good, Mai-chan!

They said they had this and that.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ellen-chan said she'd be dressing up like a wolf, didn't she? Yui-chan, do you know? For Kiyoka-chan and everybody.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> I told Kiyoka-chan she should dress up like a witch and little red riding hood, but she wouldn't wear those costumes in the end.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...You gave her something weird to wear, didn't you?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Eh-- The skirt was just a liiittle bit short is all!?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ahaha... I'm pretty sure that's the reason.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> But, I'd love to see Kiyoka-chan all dressed up in costume if I could. And Chie-san and Mihono-chan too, of course!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I'm sure you would, Yui-chan. We should hurry over there then.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Whoaa--! They're even letting us take photos up here-!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> C'mon Hiyori-chan, get a good look.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Yeah, it's a great view. I guess it's how they set it up, but it really looks like nighttime.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> They're probably trying to make it look more Halloween.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> But, is this really alright? Us taking photos here.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Seems like it's fine. You can't see it from right here, but just under this there's a space and a fence to stop people from falling, just in case.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Safety first, even when you're having fun.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> It'd be dangerous if little kids were jumping around, but a quick photo shoot should be fine.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> So, Kanami-chan, strike a pose for me!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> A pose? How's this?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> That's good, Kanami-chan, so good! It's got that... "This world of night belongs to me--" feeling!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ehehe... Getting dressed up and cosplaying might be kinda fun?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah, Hiyori-chan. Since we're both vampires, how about we get our picture taken together?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Alright. Can we get in a little closer?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> That might be tricky.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> What are you two saying? You're pairing up for a shot, so you've got to get right up on each other!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> So close you're practically hugging!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Wha!?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Like this?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...Ka-Kanami!? Th-That's too close.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Niiice going, Kanami-chan~.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Doing this kind of thing is nice every now and then.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah. We should all go together for Halloween again next year!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah, but before that, there's the cultural festival, Christmas, New Year's, Valentines.
