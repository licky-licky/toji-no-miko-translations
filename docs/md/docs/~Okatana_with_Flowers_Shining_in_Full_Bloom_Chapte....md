## 1: A Grudge Over Food is a Fearsome Thing\!
**Kanami:** Eh\!\? Just like that\!\? I wanted to hang around with Yuuna-chan and Tougou-san longer at least\!  
**Kanami:** And I wanted to have a practice fight with Karin-chan and Fuu-san, and I wanted to get to know Sonoko-chan and Itsuki-chan a little better\.\.\.  
**Nogi Sonoko:** I'm sad to hear it too\.\.\. But the gods don't give preference to people's circumstances\.  
**Yuuki Yuuna:** Still, I'm glad\. This means Kanami-chan and the rest get to go back to their home world now\.  
**Kanami:** Yuuna-chan\! Tougou-san\! Fuu-san\! Karin-chan\! Sonoko-chan\! Itsuki-chan\!  
**Kanami:** I hope someday, we can meet--  
**Inubouzaki Fuu:** I guess they're gone\. We didn't get a chance to talk much, but they seemed like good people\.  
**Inubouzaki Itsuki:** \.\.\.Mm, I wanted to ask them what things were like in their world\.  
**Miyoshi Karin:** What happens once will happen twice\. I'm sure we'll see each other again\.  
**Sonoko:** That's right\~\. Maybe next time, we'll be the ones dropping by their world\.  
**Tougou Mimori:** When Sonocchi says it, it feels like it could actually happen\.  
**Yuuna:** But you know, that would definitely be fun too\! So\.\.\. Let's see them again someday\!  
**Aradama:** ooo\.\.\. oooOOOOOOOO\!\!  
**Kiyoka:** \.\.\.Huh\? It's not here\? That's strange\.\.\. I know I put it in here though\.\.\.  
**Yui:** What are you doing with your head stuck in the fridge, Kiyoka-chan\? Your butt's wide open\.  
**Kiyoka:** Uwah\!\?  
**Kiyoka:** Th-The pudding I bought for the investigation team to eat together is missing\.\.\.  
**Yui:** Well that sounds like trouble\.  
**Kiyoka:** Y-Yeah\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** What're you covering up your skirt for\?  
**Yui:** Turns out, the pudding that Kiyoka-chan bought went missing\.  
**Kaoru:** Pudding\? I remember Mihono had some with her earlier\.  
**Kiyoka:** Hono-chan had\.\.\. I see, so Hono-chan did it again\.\.\. How many times have I told her\.\.\.\!  
**Kiyoka:** Thank you for your help, Kaoru-san\.  
**Kaoru:** S-Sure\.  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.Kiyoka's weirdly fired up, isn't she\.  
**Yui:** \.\.\.That's for sure\. I've never seen Kiyoka-chan looking that mad before\. Mihono-chan\.\.\. Amen\.  
**Kiyoka:** Hono-chan\!\!  
**Mihono:** Eep\!\? \.\.\.Oh, Kiyoka\? Wh-What's with that scary face you're making\?  
**Kiyoka:** \.\.\.Did you eat the pudding\?  
**Mihono:** Pudding\? Ah, if you mean the stuff in the fridge, then I ate it\. It was really yummy\!  
**Kiyoka:** Of course it was yummy\!  
**Kiyoka:** That was the pudding I lined up to buy because I thought we could all eat it together\!  
**Mihono:** It was\!\?  
**Mihono:** S-Sorry\.\.\. But, I didn't know\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** Just because you didn't know, does that mean you can eat whatever pudding you find in the fridge\!\?  
**Mihono:** Uu\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** You're horrible, Hono-chan\!  
**Mihono:** A mission, now\!\?  
**Mihono:** Let's see, strong aradama have simultaneously appeared in multiple locations\. Hurry to the site at once\. The members are as follows: Konohana-san, Yui, Kaoru-san, me, and\.\.\.\.\.\. Kiyoka\.  
**Kiyoka:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Suzuka:** Are you all prepared\? We're leaving now\.  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** \.\.\.  
**Suzuka:** My, what a tense atmosphere\. Did something happen between those two\?  
**Yui:** Y'see, they're actually in the middle of a fight\.\.\.  
**Suzuka:** Of all things\.\.\. I'm worried for how this will go now\.  
**Suzuka:** There was a report of a strange group of girls being sighted at where we're headed as well\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** A strange group of girls\?  
**Suzuka:** That's right, a group of girls engaging the aradama without okatana\.\.\. Using everything from guns, to wires, to even their fists\.\.\. Or so they said\.  
**Yuuna:** HERO PUUUNCH\!  
**Aradama:** OOOOOOOOOOOO\!  
**Yuuna:** Uwawa\!  
**Tougou:** Fall back, Yuuna-chan\! I'll cover you\!  
**Sonoko:** Hmmm, like I thought, with only us here, no matter how much we weaken them, we don't seem to be able to defeat aradama\~\.  
**Sonoko:** On top of that, compared to the ones we fought in the Jukai, these seem even stronger\. I wonder why that is\?  
**Karin:** We can wonder about that later; focus on the fight right now\! HAAAAAAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Itsuki:** Pant, pant\.\.\. This is too different from fighting against vertex\.\.\. If only those toji were here\.\.\.\!  
**Fuu:** Just keep at it, girls\! Actually\.\.\. Where is here anyway\!\?  

## 2: Heroes Once More
**Yuuna:** TEYAAAAAAAAA-\!\!  
**Yui:** Ooh, there really were some cuties going at it without any okatana\!  
**Yui:** Go on-\! Hit it right there-\! Punch punch punch\!  
**Suzuka:** The sight alone gives me a headache\.\.\. But this isn't the time to stand around watching\.  
**Suzuka:** Move in to protect them\!  
**Kiyoka/Mihono/Yui:** Right\!  
**Itsuki:** O-Onee-chan\! I think it's getting to be too much\.\.\.\!  
**Fuu:** I know, but\.\.\. Aghh, come on\! If we just had a few extra hands here\!  
**Kaoru:** Looks like we made good timing then\. HAAA\!  
**Mihono:** Are you okay\!\?  
**Fuu:** Ah-\! It's you\.\.\.\!  
**Fuu:** Showing up in a pinch; now you're the ones acting like heroes\! \.\.\.Thanks, Mihono\!  
**Mihono:** Eh\? Why do you know my name\.\.\. Huh\? Where have I seen you before\.\.\.  
**Yuuna:** Look, Tougou-san\! Mihono-chan came to help us\!  
**Tougou:** Kiyoka-chan is here too\.\.\. These are some reliable reinforcements\.  
**Kiyoka:** You know my name\.\.\.\?  
**Suzuka:** HAAA-\!  
**Suzuka:** Are these girls acquaintances of yours, Asakura-san, Musumi-san\?  
**Mihono:** I don't know them\.\.\. I think\.  
**Kiyoka:** Right\.\.\. I don't think we've ever met, but\.\.\.  
**Suzuka:** \.\.\.I'm not sure I understand the situation, but it would be best to talk it over after we're done\. First, let's suppress these aradama\!  
**Fuu:** Honestly, we get thrown into who knows where all of a sudden, and then there's aradama\? Mihono and them really saved us\.  
**Mihono:** Um-\.\.\. You keep talking like we know each other, but, have we met before\?  
**Fuu:** Eh\!\? You don't remember\?  
**Yuuna:** What about me\!\? I'm Yuuki Yuuna\! I'm a \"Hero\"\!  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.Sorry, I don't know you\.  
**Yunna:** Come on\~\. What about Kiyoka-chan\!\?  
**Kiyoka:** I don't know you either\.\.\.  
**Tougou:** What's going on, Sonocchi\?  
**Sonoko:** Hmmm, it might be hard for the toji to form memories of what happens in the Jukai\.\.\. Maybe it was only like a dream to them\.  
**Karin:** Well, even if they forgot, they're still the same as before\. So we shouldn't have to worry about it then, right\?  
**Itsuki:** That's true\.\.\. You're right\! I'm sure we'll be friends again right away\!  
**Fuu:** It's still kind of unfortunate, but what can you do\.  
**Mihono:** I don't really know what's going on, but, sorry\.  
**Yuuna:** No, it's okay, you don't have to apologize for anything\!  
**Suzuka:** Are you finished talking\? Leaving that aside, there are plenty of things I would like to ask you all\.  
**Itsuki:** Wawa, a sort of scary person's here\.\.\.  
**Suzuka:** I am from the Special Sword Administration Bureau, Konohana Suzuka, second seat of the elite guard\. And you are\?  
**Fuu:** Third year at Sanshu Middle School, Inubouzaki Fuu\. All of us are \"Heroes\"\.  
**Suzuka:** Heroes\.\.\.\? So you aren't toji after all\. You don't appear to be using the weapons of a toji\.\.\.  
**Yuuna:** That's right\! I'm a second year at Sanshu Middle School\! I'm Yuuki Yuuna, the Hero\!  
**Tougou:** Second year at Sanshu Middle School, Tougou Mimori\.  
**Karin:** Second year at Sanshu, a Hero, I'm Miyoshi Karin\.  
**Itsuki:** Umm, I'm a first year at Sanshu Middle School, Inubouzaki Itsuki\.\.\.  
**Sonoko:** Likewise, I'm a second year at Sanshu, Nogi Sonoko's here\~\!  
**Suzuka:** Sanshu Middle School\.\.\. Not part of the Five Traditions either, then\.  
**Suzuka:** Even though you aren't toji, you fight aradama\. I find that hard to believe\. We'll need to conduct an investigation\.  
**Fuu:** Ahaha, this is the second time we've gone through this, isn't it\.\.\. Kitora-san said the same sort of thing\.  
**Yuuna:** Anyway, Konohana-san\! Where in Shikoku are we\?  
**Suzuka:** Shikoku\? We aren't there; this is nearby to Kamakura\.  
**Fuu:** Kamakura\!\?  
**Fuu:** \.\.\.Kamakura, as in, the Kamakura Shogunate\?  
**Tougou:** \.\.\.No, I think it's a city in the Kanagawa Prefecture that was once said to exist in Kanto\.  
**Fuu:** Kanto\!\? Isn't Kanto something from ancient history\!\?  
**Suzuka:** What are you saying\? Kanto is currently right here\.  
**Kaoru:** This conversation's kinda all over the place\.\.\.  
**Yuuna:** U-Uhhh\.\.\. What if this is\.\.\. like we learned about in history class, the time before the Era of the Gods\.\.\.\?  
**Itsuki:** What does that mean then\!\? Did we time travel\?  
**Sonoko:** Take a deep breath\~, Yuuyu, Ittsun\. I think what happened is the opposite of what happened last time\.  
**Sonoko:** Before, the toji came to the Jukai, and oppositely, the Heroes have now come to the toji world\.\.\. That's all\.  
**Sonoko:** The Japan in the world the toji are from would have followed a completely different course of history to ours\.  
**Yuuna:** Oh\. We didn't get the ask the toji about what their world was like back then, so that's what happened\.\.\.  
**Suzuka:** Now then\.\.\. What should we do about this\. I can't quite follow what it is you're all talking about\.  
**Mihono:** Um, Konohana-san\? I think we can trust them\. They don't seem like they're bad or anything\.\.\.  
**Yui:** That's right\! That's right\! Girls that cute could never be bad people\!  
**Kaoru:** Ignoring what Yui's saying, they don't seem like they'd be our enemies\. So wouldn't taking them into protective custody be the right thing to do here\?  
**Kiyoka:** I think that would be for the best too\.\.\.  
**Suzuka:** \.\.\.Well, that's true\.  
**Itsuki:** Sigh, thank goodness-\. It doesn't look like things will get rough\.\.\.  
**Suzuka:** Besides, responding to the mass outbreak of aradama takes priority over dealing with you girls\.  
**Yuuna:** Are there really that many aradama out there\?  
**Mihono:** Yeah, and they're tough aradama too\! It's an abnormal situation\!  
**Yuuna:** It is\? Then, we'll help you defeat the aradama too\!  
**Mihono:** You will\? Thanks\!  
**Tougou:** But, Yuuna-chan, we'll have to come up with a way to return to our own world as soon as we can\.  
**Tougou:** If something were to happen to our world while we're away\.\.\.  
**Yuuna:** Ah, that's right\.\.\. Still, we can't just ignore the aradama either\.\.\.  
**Sonoko:** You're so kind, Yuuyu\~\.  
**Sonoko:** Mm, I think I agree with Yuuyu here\. And also, we can't be sure whether the abnormal outbreak of aradama and our coming to this world isn't related somehow\.  
**Itsuski:** What do you mean\?  
**Sonoko:** It might be that the Shinju-sama sent us here to this world, telling us to stop the aradama\.  
**Tougou:** I see\.\.\. That might be a possibility\.\.\.  
**Fuu:** It's not like we know how to get back to our world, so it should be fine to take care of all these aradama for the time being\.  
**Fuu:** So that means, all us Heroes are going to help out with the aradama suppression\!  
**Yui:** Hooray\! You can never have too many girls that'll fight right alongside you\!  
**Kiyoka:** When you talk like that, Yui-chan, I can only ever feel evil intentions\.\.\.  
**Yui:** What's that, Kiyoka-chan\~, are you jealous\? Don't worry, you're still my number 1\!  
**Kiyoka:** Sigh\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** The Hero girls are going to fight with us\! That'll be a big help\!  
**Yuuna:** Yeah, let's all do whatever we can\!  
**Suzuka:** Hold it right there, we haven't yet decided for you to fight\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Your punches were awesome, Yuuna\! I wanna try that too\.  
**Yuuna:** If you became a Hero, I bet you could do it too, Mihono-chan\! You're likely to succeed if you try\!  
**Mihono:** A Hero-\! Yeah, where there's a will, there's a way\!  
**Suzuka:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** They've totally hit it off already\.  
**Suzuka:** It seems there's no way around it\. I'll report to Yukari-sama\.\.\. As per my discretion in the field, these girls are permitted to fight alongside us\.  

## 3: Hero Club Emergency Activity\!
**Mihono:** HAAAA-\!  
**Yuuna:** EIII--\!  
**Kiyoka:** HAA-\!  
**Tougou:** I'll provide covering fire\!  
**Mihono:** Alright, I think we beat it\. Ah, Kiyoka\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** KIEEEEEEE\!  
**Kaoru:** Phew, looks like all the aradama around here are dealt with\. I wanna hurry back and catch some rest\.\.\.  
**Fuu:** It sure feels good having you toji with us against these aradama\.  
**Suzuka:** Not just that\. We wouldn't be able to suppress them so smoothly if not for your help\.  
**Suzuka:** Now then, it seems a detached unit will be dealing with the aradama that appeared elsewhere, so we'll be on standby for the time being\.  
**Yuuna:** I'm bored, Tougou-saaan\.  
**Tougou:** Here, have some botamochi\.  
**Yuuna:** Ohmm\.\.\. It's tasty\.  
**Karin:** \.\.\.What are you two even doing\?  
**Itsuki:** Heh\. They said we're on standby, but since we don't know what to do, it's a little troubling isn't it\.  
**Fuu:** Does anybody have anything they want to do\?  
**Yuuna:** Ah, it's not exactly something I want to do, but there is something I'm interested in\!  
**Fuu:** Go, Yuuna\!  
**Yuuna:** I haven't seen Mihono-chan and Kiyoka-chan talking to each other\!  
**Sonoko:** That's right, things seem a little tense between them\. Could they be fighting\?  
**Fuu:** In that case, let's ask someone who'll know\.  
**Yui:** I've been called on\!  
**Kaoru:** So, what is it you wanted to ask us\?  
**Yuuna:** About Mihono-chan and Kiyoka-chan, are they fighting\?  
**Yui:** Ah-, it's about that-\.  
**Yui:** The truth is, Mihono-chan ate the pudding Kiyoka-chan bought\.  
**Fuu:** That'll mean war\.  
**Itsuki:** \.\.\.Though, at times like these, you're the one who eats the pudding, Onee-chan\.  
**Fuu:** Ahaha\.\.\. A-Anyway, if that's the case, the Hero Club needs to take action\!  
**Yuuna:** Today's Hero Club activity is to get Mihono-chan and Kiyoka-chan to make up\! Right\?  
**Yui:** Hero club\? \.\.\.What's that\?  
**Yuuna:** We're a club that goes out with a good heart to do what we can to help everyone\! That's why we're the Hero Club\!、  
**Tougou:** We do club activities at our middle school\. If someone is in trouble or needs assistance, we give them a helping hand\.  
**Yuuna:** Whether it's looking for foster parents for a cat, or cleaning up the neighborhood, or helping out at the Children's Festival\! We'll take on helping friends make up too\!  
**Kaoru:** Like halfway between a jack of all trades and a volunteer group then\.  
**Fuu:** Well, if I had to put it simply, it's something like that\.  
**Yui:** A club\! So that means, you Heroes always group up in a club room and do your activities\!  
**Yui:** All these cute girls\! All grouped up in one room\! What a wonderful secret garden\!  
**Yui:** Fuu-san\! I'm going to join the Hero Club too\!\! I'll fill out a club entry form straight away\!  
**Kaoru:** What are you even going on about\.\.\.  
**Fuu:** Let's get back on topic\! Today's Hero Club activity is\~\~\.\.\. Tadah\! We'll get Mihono and Kiyoka on friendly terms again\!  
**Fuu:** Does anyone have any good ideas\?  
**Yui:** Hmm, Kiyoka-chan was strangely mad this time, so I don't think she'll let Mihono-chan off very easy\.  
**Sonoko:** A grudge over pudding is a fearsome thing after all\~\.  
**Kaoru:** Keep eating it over and over and anybody's patience'll run out\.  
**Yuuna:** Hmm, what should we do then, Tougou-san\.  
**Tougou:** It's difficult, isn't it\.  
**Tougou:** If I were angry at Yuuna-chan, I would forgive her as soon as she apologized though\.\.\.  
**Karin:** What if she gives her a set of high grade supplements and niboshi\?  
**Itsuki:** I think you're the only one who would forgive someone with that, Karin-san\.\.\.  
**Yuuna:** I know\! Since they're fighting over pudding, wouldn't it work if they make up over pudding too\?  
**Yui:** You mean, if we buy the same pudding that Kiyoka-chan bought, she'll forgive her\?  
**Yuuna:** No, what she should give her has got to be homemade\! She can make up with Kiyoka-chan with homemade pudding\!  
**Yuuna:** So that's why, Mihono-chan, let's make pudding in a bucket, and then you can make up with Kiyoka-chan\!  
**Mihono:** Yuuna, Tougou-san, Sonoko\.\.\. And Kaoru-san too, thanks, for coming to help me\!  
**Mihono:** I'll give my best attempt at making  a bucket of pudding\!  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.At what point did it become a bucket of pudding\?  
**Yuuna:** If you're trying to make up with someone, bigger is always best\!  
**Mihono:** Yeah\! A bucket of pudding would definitely make her happier than normal pudding\!  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.These two are just peas in a pod, huh\.  
**Sonoko:** So long as they're having a good time\~\. By the way, do you know how to make pudding\?  
**Yuuna:** Ah, I don't know how\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** I don't either\.\.\.  
**Tougou:** Don't worry, Yuuna-chan, Mihono-chan\. I know how you make it\.  
**Sonoko:** Wasshi, you can make western sweets too\~\?  
**Tougou:** Japanese fare is my specialty, but it isn't like I completely dislike western sweets\.  
**Tougou:** You know that, don't you, Sonocchi\? We had gelatto together after all\.  
**Sonoko:** Ahaha, that is true\~\.  
**Tougou:** Anyway, I'll coach you through how to make it\. Since we're making pudding, let's make the tastiest pudding we can\!  
**Mihono:** Yeah\!  
**Tougou:** That's a good serious look in your eyes, Mihono-chan\!  
**Mihono:** I'm the one who ate Kiyoka's pudding, after all\.  
**Mihono:** That's why, I'll make pudding that's way yummier than that pudding, and make up with Kiyoka for sure\!  
**Kaoru:** I mean, there's no way you're going to beat pudding that was up for sale\.  
**Mihono:** Where there's a will, there's a way\!  
**Yuuna:** Yeah, that's the spirit, Mihono-chan\! You'll make up with Kiyoka-chan for sure\!  
**Mihono:** Yeah\!  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.Ah, I messed up\.  
**Tougou:** Don't worry, we brought Sonocchi and Kaoru-san along just for moments like these\.  
**Kaoru/Sonoko:** \.\.\.Huh\?  
**Mihono:** I did it\.\.\. I did it, Yuuna\!  
**Yuuna:** You did it, Mihono-chan\!  
**Kaoru:** Burp\.\.\. G-Great\.\.\. If you messed up any more\.\.\. I couldn't eat any more\.\.\.  
**Sonoko:** Partway through\.\.\. I started to feel like I was the one being eaten by the pudding instead\.\.\.  

## 4: Kiyoka's Feelings
While Mihono was making bucket pudding with Yuuna and the others\.\.\.

  
**Fuu:** Then, Kamakura\!  
**Karin:** We sure are in Kamakura, but\.\.\. Were you really supposed to use \"Then, Kamakura\!\" at times like this\? 		[When major incidents happened during the Kamakura Shogunate, all samurai would be summoned to Kamakura, and over time this phrase just came to mean \"in case of emergency\"]  
**Fuu:** Don't sweat the small things\! Right now, let's have our fill of Kamakura\!  
**Itsuki:** Kiyoka-san, Yui-san\. Thank you for taking us to see the sights on such short notice\.  
**Yui:** If a pretty looking girl like you is asking me to show her around, then I'm all over it\!  
**Yui:** Right, Kiyoka-chan\!  
**Kiyoka:** \.\.\.  
**Yui:** Kiyoka-chan\?  
**Kiyoka:** Ah, sorry, I wasn't listening\. What is it\?  
**Itsuki:** Thank you for taking us sightseeing, Kiyoka-san\.  
**Kiyoka:** It's fine, it's nothing to show you around\!  
**Yui:** \.\.\.Kiyoka-chan's head is off in the clouds\.  
**Itsuki:** Do you think her fight with Mihono-san is bothering her after all\?  
**Yui:** That's probably it\. I've never seen them fighting for this long before\.\.\.  
**Itsuki:** I hope we can make things up between them here\.\.\. We'll have to do our best to take Kiyoka-san out around town until Mihono is finished with her bucket pudding\!  
**Yui:** Itsuki-chan, you're so considerate\.\.\. I love you\!  
**Fuu:** Whoa now\! Before you lay a hand on my Itsuki, you'll have to go through me first\!  
**Yui:** Then it's a duel\!  
**Karin:** \.\.\.What're they playing around for\.  
**Karin:** Honestly\.\.\. Kiyoka, is there any spots you'd recommend we go see\?  
**Kiyoka:** \.\.\.  
**Karin:** Sigh\. If it's bothering you that much, then why are you even fighting with her in the first place\?  
**Kiyoka:** Uu\.\.\. Wh-Why do you know about that\.\.\.  
**Karin:** Anyone can tell just by seeing you two\. Mihono ate your pudding, didn't she\?  
**Kiyoka:** You can tell that much just by looking\!\?  
**Yui:** Ah, sorry\. I told them about that part\.  
**Karin:** I think it's Mihono's fault for eating the pudding, but have you not considered apologizing to her yourself\?  
**Kiyoka:** But\.\.\. This isn't even the first time Hono-chan has eaten someone's pudding either\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** And also, I was looking forward to sharing it with everyone too\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** This time, I just wanted Hono-chan to apologize\.\.\.  
**Fuu:** I understand\!  
**Fuu:** A grudge over food is a fearsome thing\~\. I know if somebody ate the udon I was looking forward to having myself, I'd be mad for sure\.  
**Kiyoka:** Y-You would, wouldn't you\!  
**Fuu:** But you know, Kiyoka\. If Mihono never apologizes, what happens then\?  
**Kiyoka:** Th-Then\.\.\. I wouldn't like that\.  
**Fuu:** In that case, you don't have to think so hard about it\.  If you want to make up with her, you just have to do it\.  
**Itsuki:** If you said you wanted to make up with her, I'm sure Mihono-san would be happy to hear it\.  
**Kiyoka:** \.\.\.You think so\?  
**Itsuki:** I do\!  
**Kiyoka:** \.\.\.Just give me a minute\!  
**Karin:** Hey, where are you going\!\?  
**Kiyoka:** I'm going\.\.\. to buy some pudding\!  
**Fuu:** Good then, that's a case closed\.  
**Yui:** And a happy ending\.\.\.  
**Itsuki:** Wait, that's not good\! If she goes back now, Mihono-san is still in the middle of making bucket pudding\!  
**Yui/Fuu:** Ah\.  
**Karin:** There's no other way around it\. Yui, tell us some famous sightseeing places\.  
**Karin:** That's what we said to bring her out here to begin with, so when she gets back, we'll just do that to waste time like we planned\.  
**Fuu:** That ability to think on your feet\.\.\. That's my Hero Club\!  
**Yui:** Karin-chan\.\.\. I love you\!  
**Karin:** You'll go for anyone, huh\.  
**Kiyoka:** \.\.\.I wonder if I can really make up with Hono-chan\.  
**Yui:** Considering it's Mihono-chan, I'm sure it'll go fine\.  
**Fuu:** That's right, Hero Club tenet number 5\! You're likely to succeed if you try\!  
**Kiyoka:** \.\.\.Aha\! I can do it if I try, right\!  
**Mihono:** Kiyoka, I'm sorry\!  
**Kiyoka:** Eh\? A big, pudding\.\.\.\?  
**Mihono:** Y-Yeah, Yuuna said, I needed pudding to make up for pudding\.\.\. That's why, I worked real hard to make a bucket full of pudding\!  
**Kiyoka:** Umm, I followed Fuu-san's advice too, and I bought you some pudding\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Eh, you got some too\.\.\.\?  
**Kiyoka:** Y-Yeah\.\.\.  
**Fuu:** Fu fu, no use hiding it now that it's come out\! That's right, in order to bring you two back together, the Hero Club was pulling the strings the whole time\!  
**Mihono/Kiyoka:** Pfft, ahahaha\!  
**Mihono:** Sorry again, Kiyoka\.  
**Kiyoka:** No, I'm sorry too, Hono-chan\!  

## 5: Mankai
**Suzuka:** An aradama's signal has been detected\. Is everyone ready\?  
**Mihono/Kiyoka:** Yes\!  
**Yuuna:** Alright, let's do our best-\!  
**Sonoko:** It feels fresh and exciting protecting somewhere outside of Shikoku\~\.  
**Kaoru:** You know, you guys are weirdly fixated on Shikoku\.  
**Karin:** It's not that we're fixated on it\. It's just\.\.\. In our world, Shikoku is all that's left\.  
**Mihono:** What do you mean\?  
**Sonoko:** In the world that we came from, for the last 300 years, the land outside of Shikoku has been inhospitable to human life\.  
**Sonoko:** Because of the vertex\.\.\. The common enemy of humanity in our world\.  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** If I'm being honest, I only half believed all this stuff you were saying about another world, but it doesn't sound like you're messing around here\.  
**Kaoru:** Nobody would look so serious saying something like that if it were all a big lie\.  
**Sonoko:** Thank you\.\.\. Kaoru-san\.  
**Yui:** Vertex\.\.\. They're like the aradama are in our world, right\? If something goes wrong here, our world could end up like that too\.\.\.  
**Suzuka:** That's what we toji are here to prevent from happening\. We're moving out\!  
**Karin:** HAAAAAA\!\!  
**Fuu:** Phew, aradama sure are tough\. We can't use Mankai either\.\.\.  
**Sonoko:** Fuumin-senpai\. It seems like we can use Mankai for this\~\.  
**Fuu:** \.\.\.Huh\?  
**Sonoko:** A little bit ago, when no one was around, I used it myself in secret\~\.  
**Fuu:** You what\!\? That's too reckless\.\.\.  
**Sonoko:** Don't worry, don't worry\. As you can see, I'm just fine\. The rules for Mankai now seem to be different from both in the past, when there was Sange, and also after it was updated\.  
**Sonoko:** There are no after-effects from Sange\. It also seems like we can use it many times over\. The Shinju-sama might be giving us a favor here\~\.  
**Fuu:** Ehh\!\? Like an extra special measure\.\.\.\? The Shinju-sama must be going through good times\.\.\.  
**Fuu:** Well, alright then\! Let's take full advantage of this favor\! We're using Mankai, Itsuki\!  
**Itsuki:** Wait for me, Onee-chan\! I'm going too\!  
**Suzuka:** What is that about\.\.\. They're overwhelmingly more capable than before\.  
**Sonoko:** That's called Mankai\. It's a Hero's ultimate weapon\~\.  
**Mihono:** And, all of you can do that\?  
**Karin:** Yep\. I'll show you what a complete Hero's Mankai looks like\!  
**Sonoko:** I'm going with you\~\!  
**Kaoru:** Ohh, these guys, they're actually pretty strong\.  
**Mihono:** We've gotta put in our best effort too\! Kiyoka, can you watch my back\?  
**Kiyoka:** Of course, Hono-chan\!  
**Mihono:** I'm counting on you\! HAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Yuuna:** Mihono-chan and Kiyoka-chan, they seem like they'll be fine now\!  
**Tougou:** They sure do\. Mihono-chan is taking point, while Kiyoka-chan backs her up\.   
**Tougou:** They're a good match for each other\.  
**Aradama:** oooOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\!\!  
**Mihono:** Uwah\!\? Some kind of super strong looking aradama just came out\!\?  
**Suzuka:** It's daunting compared to the aradama we've faced so far\.  
**Tougou:** The boss of them all must have shown itself here then\.  
**Yuuna:** Leave it to me\! I'm using Mankai here\!  
**Yuuna:** HERO PUUUNCH\!  
**Aradama:** GUOOO\!  
**Tougou:** If you're going in, Yuuna-chan, then I'll be with you\! I'll carry out an all out assault on the enemy forces\!  
**Aradama:** GUOOooo\.\.\.\!  
**Yuuna:** Mihono-chan\! Kiyoka-chan\! We softened up the aradama\!  
**Mihono:** Okay\! Just leave the rest to us\!  
**Mihono:** Let's go, Kiyoka\!  
**Kiyoka:** Right\!  
**Mihono:** The Heroes have some great teamwork and cooperation, but we'll show them the investigation team can do just as good too\!  
**Kiyoka:** Okay\!\! Let's do it\!  
**Mihono/Kiyoka:** HAAAAAA-\!\!  
**Aradama:** OoooOOooo\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** We\.\.\. We beat it\!\!  
**Kiyoka:** We did, didn't we, Hono-chan\!  
**Mihono:** It's all because you were here with me\!  
**Kiyoka:** No, it's because you were so strong, Hono-chan\!  
**Karin:** Look at that, now they're as close as can be\.  
**Yui:** Mmhm, that closeness is a thing of beauty\. I want to get in there too\!  
**Fuu:** We beat the aradama, and Mihono and Kiyoka safely made up with each other\! That's the Hero Club's work here finished\! Good work, everyone\!  
**Yuuna:** Wh-What was that\!\?  
**Sonoko:** Ah\.\.\. It seems like, that's all for this time\.  
**Sonoko:** I'm starting to lose feeling in my body\.\.\. I'm sure we're being drawn back to our world on the other side\.  
**Mihono:** You mean, we already have to say goodbye\!\?  
**Tougou:** It seems that way\.\.\. Though it's a shame\. Like last time, it's so sudden\.  
**Fuu:** We might not have been together for long, but it was a lot of fun being in this world\. Thanks for that\.  
**Mihono:** Wait\! I still didn't\.\.\.\!  
**Yuuna:** See you, everyone\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Ah\.\.\. They disappeared\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** Man\.\.\. They sure were a loud bunch\. But with them gone, it'll be kind of lonely too\.  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.I still didn't tell them thanks for helping me make up with Kiyoka\.  
**Kiyoka:** Hono-chan\.\.\.  
**Suzuka:** They say that what happens twice will happen thrice\. If you want to thank them, you can do it next time you meet\.  
**Mihono:** Yeah, that's right, isn't it\.  
**Mihono:** Ah, oh yeah\. Since the mission's over, does everyone want to go get something to eat\?  
**Suzuka:** That sounds fine\. Given the occasion, I think I'll join you\.  
**Yui:** Alright\!  
**Kiyoka:** What should we have\?  
**Mihono:** That'll be\.\.\. Udon, of course\!  

## 6: So I Never Forget Again
**Sonoko:** YAAAAAAA\!  
**Mihono:** DEEIIII-\!\!  
**Tougou:** With that, the aradama have been suppressed\.  
**Mihono:** Thanks, Tougou-san, Sonoko\! Now we just need to collect up the noro\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Huh, someone's calling\? It's Konohana-san\.  
**Mihono:** Hello, this is Asakura Mihono\.  
**Suzuka:** This is a report from the Special Sword Administration Bureau\. After defeating the aradama from this abnormal outbreak, there have been cases of unidentified objects being found along with the noro\.  
**Mihono:** Unidentified objects\?  
**Suzuka:** Yes\. The shape is always a four sided pyramid\. As for their size, many of them are larger than a human body\.  
**Suzuka:** I'll send a photo, so please confirm with those \"Heroes\" with you if they can shed any light on the subject\.  
**Mihono:** Whoa, what are those\.\.\. They're like pyramids\.  
**Mihono:** Hey, Tougou-san, Sonoko\! Do you know anything about these things\? It sounds like they're coming out of aradama after they get beaten\.\.\.  
**Tougou:** This is\.\. The soul of a vertex\!\?  
**Mihono:** Soul\? What do you mean  
**Tougou:** For the enemies that appear in our world, the vertex, this is something similar to their heart\.  
**Sonoko:** If this is coming out of aradama, then does that mean the aradamas out there have been eating up vertex souls\~\!\?  
**Tougou:** Mihono-chan, the aradama appearing now may have grown stronger because they've taken in these souls\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Really\!\?  
**Sonoko:** We can't prove it, but it sounds likely\.\.\. The vertex and aradama both have their relation to divinity, so it could be the aradama have what it takes to assimilate it\.  
**Sonoko:** Either way, we can't go leaving those vertex souls here in your world, so we'll be bringing them back with us\.  
**Mihono:** Then, did the aradama we just beat have those in them too\.\.\.\?  
**Mihono:** Wait, this isn't one of those pyramids\. What is it\?  
**Sonoko:** Hmm, I haven't seen this before, but\.\.\. I'm not getting a bad feeling from it, so I don't think it's dangerous\?  
**Mihono:** Okay, then I'm going to try touching it\!  
**Sonoko:** You really are a \"leap before you look\!\" kind of girl, aren't you, Mihocchi\~\. Just like Yuuyu\.  
**Mihono:** You mean Yuuna\? Well you're right, I feel like I could really get along with her\!  
**Tougou:** Fufu, that's true\. You two are very much alike, so I'm sure you would get along\.  
**Tougou:** But, the closest one to Yuuna-chan will always be me\.  
**Mihono:** Uhh, your voice got all serious all of a sudden\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Anyway, I'm going to try touching the weird object\!  
**Mihono:** Eh\.\.\. Huh\?  
**Tougou:** What is it\?  
**Mihono:** Ah\.\.\. It's like\.\.\. I remembered\. When we were in that Jukai place, all of us fighting along with the Heroes\.\.\. Huh\? Why did I forget about that, anyway\?  
**Sonoko:** After touching the strange object that came from the aradama, your memories came back\.\.\.\? Here, let me see that for a minute\~\.  
**Sonoko:** Ah\. There's a message, on the Hero app on our phones\.\.\. \"Sensing a spiritual power\"\?  
**Sonoko:** \.\.\.Hmmmm, if the app is reacting to it, then maybe this could be, a piece of the Shinju-sama's power\~\?  
**Tougou:** Then, when Mihono-chan came in contact with the Shinju-sama's power, her memories of us returned\?  
**Mihono:** If that's what happened\.\.\. Then, so long as we have these, we won't forget all of you\!\?  
**Sonoko:** Mmm\~, I'd say there's a chance at least\. We don't know how long the Shinju-sama's influence will go on for, so unless we collect a lot of them, it might not work\.  
**Mihono:** Okay-, then I'm going to collect a whole bunch\! I'll beat all the aradama, and get them all\! Where there's a will, there's a way\!  
**Tougou:** We'll give you assistance\. We only just managed to meet again, so it would be too sad for you to forget\.  
**Sonoko:** I'll help too\~\!  
**Mihono:** Thanks a lot\! Let's go and beat up the next group of aradama right away\!

## [Yuusha 2 Yui: Start]: Little Sister and Big Sister
Yamashiro Yui has been paired with Inubouzaki Itsuki to suppress aradama\.\.\.

  
**Yui:** It's a pleasure working with you, Itsuki-chan\!  
**Itsuki:** Y-Yes, thank you for working with me, Yui-san\.  
**Yui:** What's that, are you feeling nervous\?  
**Itsuki:** Yes\.\.\. A little bit\.  
**Itsuki:** Up until now, whenever I fought aradama, it was with a lot more people, so this is my first time with just one other person\.\.\.  
**Yui:** You don't have to worry about a thing, Itsuki-chan\. I might not look like it, but I'm super strong\!  
**Yui:** I'll be there for you whenever you need it\!  
**Itsuki:** Okay, I'll be in your care\.  
**Yui:** -\!\!  
**Yui:** (Wh-What is this, this feeling\.\.\.\)  
**Yui:** (This is different from what I feel with everyone in the investigation team\.\.\. Could this be, my motherly instincts\!\?\)  
**Itsuki:** Yui-san\?  
**Yui:** It's nothing at all, nothing at all\.  
**Yui:** [inhale]\.\.\. [exhale]\.\.\. Okay\! While we're moving around together, you can feel free to think of me as your big sister\!  
**Itsuki:** You'll be my big sister, Yui-san\?  
**Yui:** I might not look like it, but I have a real little sister, which makes me a real big sister\.  
**Itsuki:** If she has a big sister like you, your little sister must be having fun every day\.  
**Yui:** Itsuki-chan\.\.\. I love you\!  
**Itsuki:** Thank you\.  
**Yui:** I want to be the best big sister I can be, so you don't know how happy it makes me to hear that\.  
**Yui:** That reminds me, what's Fuu-san usually like\? As a fellow big sister, I'm a little curious\.  
**Itsuki:** What's Onee-chan like\? Onee-chan, she's\.\.\. She's like that\.  
**Yui:** Doesn't change at all, huh\.\.\.  
**Yui:** If she came to a different world and she's still acting the same as always, that's amazing\.  
**Itsuki:** Yes, Onee-chan's pretty amazing\!  
**Yui:** Fuhehe, you're so cuteee\.\.\.  
**Itsuki:** Yui-san\?  
**Yui:** [drool]\.\.\. Oops\.  
**Yui:** (Control yourself\! I've gotta make big sister moves in front of Itsuki-chan\!\)  
**Yui:** Aradama\!\? Itsuki-chan, get ready for battle\!  
**Itsuki:** Right\!  

## [Yuusha 2 Yui: End]: There's No Such Thing As a Little Sister Who Hates Her Big Sister
**Yui:** YAAAAAAAAAAA\!  
**Aradama:** GUOOOOOOOOOOOO\!  
**Yui:** It's a real pain with this many of them\! Are you doing okay, Itsuki-chan\!\?  
**Itsuki:** Yes, I'm fine\.\.\. Kyaa-\!  
**Yui:** Itsuki-chan\!\?  
**Itsuki:** I-I'm alright\! More importantly\.\.\. Can ask you to handle things here for a minute\?  
**Yui:** Sure, but\.\.\. Do you have some kind of plan\?  
**Itsuki:** I was thinking of setting up a trap\. It might not go that well though\.\.\.  
**Yui:** Don't worry about that at all\! If it goes wrong, I'll be there to back you up\!  
**Itsuki:** Ah\.\.\. Just now, you sounded like Onee-chan\.  
**Yui:** I didn't just sound like one; right now, I am your big sister\! So just leave things here to me\!  
**Itsuki:** Please go ahead\!  
**Aradama:** oooo\.\.\.    
**Yui:** Phew, that should be all of them\. Nice work back there, Itsuki-chan\!  
**Itsuki:** Right, you were working hard too, Yui-san\! Now we can go back to see everyone else\.  
**Yui:** \.\.\.Wait\? Why are you holding your arm like that\?  
**Itsuki:** Th-That's because\.\.\.  
**Yui:** Something's fishy\.\.\.  
**Yui:** Show me your arm for a minute\! --Hey, you're hurt\!\?  
**Itsuki:** I got hurt, but this much is nothing really\.\.\.  
**Yui:** No matter how small it is, any injury on a cute girl is life-threatening\! Let me see it\!  
**Itsuki:** O-Okay\.  
**Itsuki:** \.\.\.I didn't want to make you worry\. I'm sorry\.  
**Yui:** You might not think it, but I'm pretty sharp when it comes to things like these\. Since my little sister has a bit of an illness\.  
**Itsuki:** I hope she gets better soon then\.  
**Yui:** \.\.\.Thanks\. I'd like to be able to go on trips and stuff with her someday\.  
**Itsuki:** You love your little sister, don't you\.  
**Yui:** Yeah\. I bet I love her just as much as Fuu-san loves you-\.  
**Itsuki:** In that case, your little sister must love you even more than that\.  
**Yui:** Eh-, why do you think that-\? I love her more for sure\!  
**Itsuki:** Because\.\.\. There's no such thing as a little sister who doesn't love their big sister\! I'm absolutely positive she love love loves you\!  
**Yui:** \.\.\.Well, I guess I can't beat that then\. Suddenly I feel like paying Miku a visit\.  
**Itsuki:** I feel like going to see Onee-chan too\.  
**Yui:** Okay-, the aradama are dealt with, so let's hurry on back\!  
**Itsuki:** Right\!
