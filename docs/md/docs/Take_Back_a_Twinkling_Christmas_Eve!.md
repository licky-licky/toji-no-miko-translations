## 1: Take Back a Twinkling Christmas Eve\! Prologue
--On the night of Christmas Eve, the streets, which every year were covered in twinkling lights, were looking strangely empty this year\.

  
**Yui:** Whyyy\!\? Why are all the lights off this year\!\?  
**Old Salesman:** W-Well, you see, we tried turning them on, okay\?  
**Old Salesman:** But you know, as soon as we did, it started attracting aradama\.  
**Yui:** B-But in that case, we can get rid of them\! So please, if you have a heart, turn the lights back onnn\!  
**Old Salesman:** I wish I could help you out here, but\.\.\. Look, when we put the ornaments up, the aradama got tangled up in them and dragged them away\.  
**Old Salesman:** So we're out of ornaments, and I don't want any more aradama coming round\. Maybe it's better just to give up on it this year\?  
**Yui:** \.\.\.I'll get\.\.\. Them back\.\.\.  
**Old Salesman:** Eh\?  
**Yui:** I'll get back every last one of the ornaments\! And I'll get rid of all the aradama myself-\!  
**Yui:** Then you'll turn the lights back on for me, right\!\?  
**Old Salesman:** L-Look, I'm not the only one responsible here\.\.\. Anyway, were you really looking forward to the lights that much\?  
**Yui:** Take a look at that\!  
**High School Girl Returning from Cram School:** Aww, there's no lights up this year\. This is the worst\.  
**High School Boy Returning from Cram School:** I remember you loved seeing them last year\.  
**Yui:** And look over there\!  
**OL Returning from Work 1:** Last year's lights were the prettiest thing to a lonely girl on Christmas, but it's even sadder if they're not doing them\.\.\.  
**OL Returning from Work 2:** Come on now, let's go to the bar together\~ Hey mister, pour two for us\!  
**Yui:** Do you see\!\?  
**Old Salesman:** \.\.\.Uh\.\.\. See what\?\?  
**Yui:** This part of town is loaded with girls coming round to see the decorations\!\!  
**Yui:** And they need to see those shining lights\!\! So I'm going to save Christmas\!\!\!\!  
**Old Salesman:** O-Ohh, I guess you're right\.\.\.  
**Yui:** Then I'll be right back after I hunt down those aradama\! I'm counting on you to turn those lights back on\!  
**Old Salesman:** Ah, hey\! \.\.\.She's gone already\. I don't have the authority for something like that though\.\.\.  
**Old Salesman:** I guess I can try calling up the local officials and commerce association at least\.\.\.  
--At the same time, a few streets away\.\.\.

  
**Mirja:** Sigh\.\.\. No sign of the Akabane sword here either, it seems\.  
**Mirja:** I suppose it won't be that easy after all\.  
--Earlier on the same day, shortly after noon at Aoto-kan\.

  
**Aoto Youji:** Yo, missy\. I'm glad as can be you decided to pay me a visit today, but\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** What is it, Aoto Youji-san\.  
**Youji:** Well, I mean, it's a bit sad seeing a pretty young lady like yourself hiding away looking at swords on Christmas Eve\.  
**Mirja:** I don't find it sad in the slightest\. I'm off duty today, so I thought appreciating swords and their mountings would be a perfect use of my time\.  
**Youji:** Haha, there's no stopping you, is there, missy\.  
**Youji:** Oh right, speaking of Christmas and winter days, I wonder if you've heard this one before\?  
**Mirja:** Heard what\?  
**Youji:** There's an okatana said to be as fleeting as the snow itself\. Name's \"Sekka\"\.  
**Mirja:** This is the first I've heard of it\.\.\. Is there anything more you can tell me\?  
**Youji:** Course\. The blade itself is a pure blueish white, like snow crystals, and there's a rumor that, during the winter season, this okatana'll show a divine power one time if its owner asks\.  
**Mirja:** I see, that's an interesting story\. If there is an okatana like that out there, I'd like to be able to see it for myself once\.  
**Youji:** You know, it's part of the rumor that, this time of year, Sekka's one of those Akabane swords they find out of aradama\.  
**Mirja:** FWHA-\!\?  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.Excuse me, is that true\? Does it have to be any specific aradama, in any specific place, or will any do\?  
**Youji:** Y-Yeah, I think anywhere'll do\. Every couple of years you hear about someone coming across Sekka\.  
**Youji:** I've never been able to witness it myself, but\.\.\. Well, even if someone does find it, it doesn't seem to stick around for them to use it very long\.  
**Mirja:** I can't afford to waste any more time\. I'll begin suppressing aradama right away\.  
**Youji:** Sekka's nice and all, but don't you want to take a look at this\? It's these special \"Holy Night\" mountings we've got just for the Christmas season, and\.\.\.  
**Youji:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** There's no use complaining about it\. So long as I continue defeating aradama\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** Oh, more have appeared\.  
**Mirja:** Yamashiro Yui\! What are you\.\.\.  
**Yui:** Ah, it's Mirja-san\! Nnnn\~, I'd love to stay and share my love with you, but I'm busy right now, so it'll have to wait till next time, sorry-\!\!  
**Mirja:** Yamashiro Yui should have had today off as well\.\.\. Could she be after Sekka too\?  
**Mirja:** Heh, then I have no intention of losing here\. I'll be the first to find Sekka\!  
**Yui:** Pant, pant\.\.\. There's still a ton of aradama left\. I've gotta get those lights turned on soon\!  
**Yui:** Haah-\!  

## 2: Take Back a Twinkling Christmas Eve\! Epilogue
**Yui:** Pant\.\.\. Wheeze\.\.\. Not yet\.\.\. Aradama\.\.\. Gotta get rid of\.\.\. All of them\.\.\.  
**Yui:** Ughh\.\.\.  
**Yui:** Guess that's it for me\.  
**Yui:** I'm falling apart\. I can't get back up\.  
**Yui:** The lights still aren't on though\.\.\. I can't let today end without finishing this\.  
**Yui:** There's no time for me to rest here\.  
**Yui:** So get up already\!  
**Someone's Voice:** \.\.\.shi\.\.\.i\!  
**Someone's Voice:** \.\.\.mashiro\.\.\.i\!  
**Mirja:** Yamashiro Yui\! Can you hear me\!\?  
**Yui:** Mirja\.\.\. San\.\.\.\?  
**Mirja:** You've regained consciousness\. That's good\.  
**Mirja:** Just as I was impressed with how aggressively you dealt with those aradama, you suddenly collapsed in the street\. I was worried, so\.\.\.  
**Yui:** Mirja-san was worried about me\.\.\. I might faint\!\!  
**Mirja:** Though it seems my concerns were unnecessary\.  
**Mirja:** Ahem\.\.\. Anyway, have you found what you were after\?  
**Yui:** Huh\? What I'm after\.\.\.\? Ah, the lights still aren't on, are they\?  
**Mirja:** Huh\? Lights\?  
**Yui:** Right, once I remove all the aradama around here and get back the Christmas ornaments, they'll turn the Christmas lights back on\!  
**Mirja:** O-Ohhh\.\.\.\?  
**Mirja:** (Does this mean I jumped to conclusions and unnecessarily made Yamashiro Yui my rival\.\.\.\?\)  
**Yui:** What's wrong, Mirja-san\? You're blushing\?  
**Mirja:** I-It's nothing\. More importantly, what about the lights\? The aradama in the area have been largely cleared out\.\.\.  
**Yui:** I got a lot of the ornaments back too, so I was thinking it can't take much more\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** Hm\.\.\. To tell the truth, I was here suppressing aradama for another reason\.\.\. Why don't we combine forces to finish the job\?  
**Yui:** Ehhh-\!\? Just you and me in a tag team, Mirja-san\!\?  
**Yui:** Hnng\~\! If only I knew there was a reward like that waiting for me\! Hard work gets repaid after all\!  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.I feel like I'm losing more than I offered, but I'll let it slide\. Let's move out\.  
**Yui:** Sure thing\!  
**Yui:** Mirja-san\! Don't you feel like we're totally in sync today\?  
**Mirja:** It's true that our coordination is smoother than usual today\. But I'm more surprised by that perseverance of yours, Yamashiro Yui\.  
**Yui:** I know, right\! I thought I was at my limit back there, but now I feel like I can just keep on going\!  
**Yui:** It must be the power of our love that let us bust through those barriers\!  
**Mirja:** I'm certain that isn't the case, but let's keep up this momentum and continue the attack\!  
**Yui & Mirja:** WOAAAAH\!\!  
**Yui:** Pant\.\.\. Pant\.\.\. Was that\.\.\. All of them\.\.\.\?  
**Mirja:** Pant\.\.\. Yamashiro\.\.\. Yui\.\.\. Take a look\.\.\. Around us\.\.\.  
**Female Student:** Ooohh\. For real, they turned the lights on\? That's perfect\!  
**Drunken OL:** Wh-What, what\!\? They're doing the lights again\? Ahhahaha\! This's the best\! Being single's the best\!  
**Yui:** Mmmm\~, this is it\! This energy\! This is the real Christmas spirit\! We did it, Mirja-san\!  
**Mirja:** Yes, seeing everyone pleased makes it all worth it\.  
**Yui:** Now that's what I call mission complete\!  
**Yui:** Oh, my phone\. Sorry, I have to take this\.\.\.  
**Yui:** Mm, it's Onee-chan\. Are you okay being up this late\?  
**Yui:** \.\.\.Oh, so you can see the lights from the hospital\?  
**Yui:** That's great\. I know you were looking forward to it\. Yeah, I can see them too\.  
**Yui:** They sure are pretty\~\.\.\. I hope we can see them together next year\.  
**Yui:** Mm\.\.\. Okay\.\.\. Oh yeah, for your present, you still want the same thing, right\?  
**Yui:** Yep, I already told Santa about it\.  
**Mirja:** I see\.\.\. The power of love, wasn't it\?  
**Yui:** Ah, sorry that took a while\. So what do we do now\?  
**Mirja:** Hm\. More aradama could appear, so perhaps we should walk around and patrol the area, so they don't turn the lights off again\.  
**Yui:** Wait, that sounds like\.\.\. Are you asking me out on a Christmas date\!\?  
**Mirja:** I am not\. Maybe we should patrol separately just to be sure\.  
**Yui:** I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I want to be with you, Mirja-san\! Let's go\!  
**Mirja:** Hang on, who said you could wrap your arm around mine\?  
**Yui:** Just let this be my reward for saving everyone's Christmas\! Just for a little bit\!  
**Mirja:** Honestly\.\.\. Fine, for a little bit\.  
**Mirja:** And that's what happened\.\.\. What's wrong, Aoto Youji-san\? Are you crying\?  
**Youji:** Yamashiro-chan, what a good girl, thinking of her sister\.  
**Youji:** Oh right, what happened on your end, missy\?  
**Mirja:** With Sekka\? I found it, and had it restored and polished\. Like you said, it's an okatana with a dreamlike beauty\.\.\.  
**Youji:** Ohh\! Well I'm glad to hear it\.  
**Mirja:** Unfortunately, I wasn't chosen by Sekka, but other members of [your unit name here\] are able to make use of it\.  
**Youji:** At least that worked out\. Ah, right, bring it by here sometime and I'll make some special mountings for it\.  
**Mirja:** I'd appreciate that\.  
**Youji:** You might only have it for a short while, but you'll want to use Sekka the best you can\!  
**Mirja:** Right\.  

## 3: How Those Two Spent Christmas
**Kofuki:** Damnit\.\.\. I've been looking all over, but she's not even at the Christmas party, is she\.  
**Mai:** Oh\? Shichinosato-san\?  
**Kofuki:** Hey, it's Sayaka and her keeper\. You two done with the party already\?  
**Mai:** Sayaka-chan's keeper\.\.\.  
**Sayaka:** We were going back to the party\. \.\.\.Kofuki, what are you doing\?  
**Kofuki:** Ahh, just looking for someone\. Seeya\.  
**Mai:** Did she lose one of her friends\?  
**Sayaka:** I think so\.\.\. The research lab is that way\.  
**Tsugumi:** That should be it for the database of aradama that appeared during the Christmas Unified Mock Battle\.  
**Tsugumi:** With Shichinosato-san's help, collecting this information became much easier\. I'll have to maintain that relationship\.  
**Tsugumi:** She must be enjoying herself at the party right about now\.  
**Tsugumi:** Fufu\.\.\. There's aradama nearby\?  
**Tsugumi:** I had heard that, while the party is ongoing, the elite guard would be responsible for aradama countermeasures, so everyone's busy at the moment\.  
**Tsugumi:** In which case, I suppose I get to handle data collection here myself\. Let's see, where's my okatana\.\.\. Ah\.  
**Kofuki:** Oi, you planning on keeping all the aradama-chan to yourself\?  
**Tsugumi:** Oh, did the party finish already\?  
**Kofuki:** \.\.\.Of course not\! Besides, you're the one who invited me, so why aren't you there\!\?  
**Tsugumi:** \.\.\.\?  
**Kofuki:** What're you looking all confused for\! If someone invites you somewhere, you'd expect them to go too\!  
**Tsugumi:** By any chance, were you looking forward to going to the party with me\?  
**Kofuki:** That's not\.\.\. Whatever, I give up\. Anyway, you're going to play with some aradama-chan, right\?  
**Kofuki:** Then I'm going with\. It'll sure beat some lame party\!  
**Tsugumi:** You've changed, you know, Shichinosato-san\.  
**Kofuki:** I don't want to hear it from you of all people\. You were bouncing up and down when you got that new sample before\.  
**Tsugumi:** Fufu, how perceptive of you\.  
**Kofuki:** I can figure out that much\.  
**Tsugumi:** You can\? That's a little surprising\.  
**Kofuki:** So, where's the aradama-chan at\? Let's go already\.  
**Tsugumi:** Don't be in such a rush\. There should be enough aradama for the two of us tonight, probably\.  
**Kofuki:** The elite guard have been hogging them all day, so I wanna fight some as fast as possible\. Got it\?  
**Tsugumi:** That's more typical behavior for you\. Why don't we get to it then\?
