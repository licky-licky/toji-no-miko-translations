## 1: Ceremonial Guard (1\)
**Suzuka:** Sorry to keep you waiting, Inago-san, Iwakura-san, Asakura-san, Musumi-san, Inami-san\.  
**Suzuka:** On Christmas, we'll have you assigned to security duty for a party the Five Traditions are hosting\.  
**Suu:** \.\.\.  
**Suu:** (I ended up on a mission with some delinquent\.\.\. Somebody, swap with me\!\!\)  
**Mihono:** It's been a while since we got a mission together, huh, Akira-san\!  
**Akira:** Definitely\. I'm gonna be looking to see how much you've grown\.  
**Mihono:** Sure thing\!  
**Kiyoka:** (Hono-chan looks like she's enjoying this\.\.\. There's some things I want to go over with her, but\.\.\. I think I'll save it for later\.\)  
**Kiyoka:** I'm looking forward to working with you, Sanae-san\.  
**Sanae:** Mm, I'm looking forward to working with you too, Musumi-san\.  
**Suu:** (Come to think of it, Kiyoka-san and Iwakura-san are from Heijou\.\.\. So then, since Hokuto-san's from Heijou too, why didn't they pick her instead of me\?\)  
**Mihono:** You look like something's bothering you, Inami-san\? Did you get a tummyache\?  
**Suu:** Ah, I'm fine\. Just thinking about something\.\.\.  
**Akira:** Nn\? And you're\.\.\.  
**Suu:** I'm just your average a little bit weaker than most toji you could find anywhere; don't mind me\!  
**Mihono:** Uwah\!\? What're you shouting for all of a sudden, Inami-san\?  
**Akira:** Inami, huh\. What's your first name\?  
**Suu:** It's Suu\.\.\. But, um, you don't have to go out of your way to remember it or anything\.\.\.  
**Akira:** You don't have to be such a downer; we're on the same team together\! Glad to have ya, Suu\.  
**Suu:** (She remembered my nameeeeeeeeeeeeee\!\!\)  
**Suu:** Um\.\.\. Mihono-san\.\.\. About Inago-san, is she\.\.\. a delinquent\?  
**Mihono:** No way\! There's some people who call her Boss, but Akira-san just likes dressing like that\.  
**Suu:** Boss\!\?  
**Akira:** Nn\? You gonna call me that too\? It's got a good ring to it, \"Boss\.\" Bring it on\.  
**Suu:** It fits you way too well so I'll have to pass\!  
**Akira:** Oh, huh\.  
**Suzuka:** It doesn't seem you'll have trouble with teamwork\. With that settled, I'll leave the rest to you\.  
**Sanae:** Could I ask one question, Konohana-san\? Who will be the leader of this group\?  
**Suzuka:** I wasn't given instructions on that\. Please decide that amongst yourselves and report back\.  

## 2: Ceremonial Guard (2\)
**Kiyoka:** Hono-chan, I wanted to talk to you about\.\.\. Oh, she's not here\?  
**Kanami:** Huh, Musumi-san\? If you're looking for Mihono-chan, as soon as school was over, she ran off somewhere\. Did you need her for something\?  
**Kiyoka:** Mm-mm, it's alright\. Thanks for letting me know, Etou-san\.  
**Kiyoka:** (I wonder where Hono-chan could have gone\?\)  
**Sanae:** Asakura-san's gone too\?  
**Kiyoka:** The way you said that, does that mean\.\.\.  
**Sanae:** Yeah\. Inago-san and Inami-san don't seem to be around either\.  
**Kiyoka:** \.\.\.  
**Sanae:** I'm not sure where Inago-san and the others went to, but I don't think those three will get into any trouble, so let's wait a bit and see\.  
**Kiyoka:** \.\.\.Okay\.  
Several days later\.

  
**Sanae:** So those three went off somewhere again today\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** \.\.\.They did\. What should we do\?  
**Sanae:** I don't think we can exactly do nothing at this point\. Let's go looking for them\.  
**Kiyoka:** \.\.\.Alright\.  

## 3: Ceremonial Guard (3\)
**Akira:** ORAAA\!\! C'mon, what's the matter\! Is that all you've got, Mihono\! Suu\!  
**Mihono:** I can still do more\! Let me go one more time, Akira-san\!  
**Akira:** Bring it on\! C'mere, Mihono\! Suu\!  
**Suu:** I'd like to take a breakkkkk\!  
**Mihono:** Let's try staggering our attacks this time, Inami-san\!  
**Suu:** Listen to what I'm sayingggg\!  
**Sanae:** They're doing practice training with Inago-san as an assailant\.\.\. Asakura-san and Inami-san both look all beat up\.  
**Kiyoka:** (Hono-chan's trying really hard out there\.\.\.\)  
**Kiyoka:** \.\.\.I feel embarrassed\.  
**Sanae:** Eh\?  
**Kiyoka:** When Hono-chan's been working that hard\.\.\. I haven't been doing anything\.\.\. It sort of makes me really embarrassed\.  
**Sanae:** \.\.\.I get what you mean\. Let's try hard enough that it'll surprise them too\.  

## 4: Ceremonial Guard (4\)
**Sanae:** Yes, the traffic conditions on Christmas\.\.\. That's right, if you could get it for the last five years or so\.  
**Kiyoka:** (Drawing up plans for the day of\.\.\. predicting the traffic conditions, securing travel routes, identifying places that could likely be blind spots\.\.\.\)  
**Kiyoka:** Phew, there's so much to take care of, isn't there\.  
**Sanae:** \.\.\.Yeah; it might be a little too much for just the two of us after all\.  
**Suu:** We'll help you out with that\!  
**Sanae:** Inami-san, Inago-san, Asakura-san\? Weren't you out training\.\.\.\?  
**Suu:** We heard people saying you two had been looking for us, so we hurried over\!  
**Suu:** We weren't at all thinking anything like, yay, a break from how harsh Inago-san is or anything\!\?  
**Akira:** Geez, look at the nerve she's got\.  
**Mihono:** Ahaha, sorry, Kiyoka\. We weren't doing anything besides training\.\.\. You had to do everything else for us, didn't you\.  
**Akira:** Nah, I'm the one to blame here\.  
**Akira:** I asked these two to cover me so I wouldn't show up late on Christmas\. And, as a tradeoff, I was helping them with training\.  
**Akira:** I figured we'd be fine since Sanae's the leader, so I ended up leaving everything to you\.  
**Sanae:** Eh\? Aren't you the leader, Inago-san\?  
**Akira:** What're you talking about\? Any way you look at it, it's gotta be you\. I'm not really the leader type\.  
**Sanae:** \.\.\.Alright then\. I'll give it my best shot\.  
**Akira:** That's that; anybody against it\?  
**Everyone:** Nope\!  

## 5: Ceremonial Guard (5\)
**Mihono:** Ahh\.\.\. It's cold\!  
**Suu:** With how cold it is, I'm scared of getting hurt, so maybe we could cancel training\.\.\.\?  
**Kiyoka:** Ahaha, I don't think that's going to happen\.\.\. Oh\? Hono-chan, there's a hole in your glove\?  
**Mihono:** I know, Kiyoka\~\. Akira-san's training was so rough that it got torn up\~\.  
**Kiyoka:** (It's almost Christmas, so I could get Hono-chan a present\.\.\.\)  
**Kiyoka:** \.\.\.\.\.\.Ah\!  
**Mihono:** Did you think of something, Kiyoka\?  
**Kiyoka:** Our security mission is on Christmas, right\? So, when we're finished, we could celebrate that and have a Christmas party\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** That'd totally be fun\! Nice idea, Kiyoka\!  
**Suu:** And, you know, if I have a Christmas party to look forward to, I feel like I can try harder with Inago-san's training\.\.\. maybe\?  
**Kiyoka:** Alright then\! Let's go pass the idea on to the others\!  
On a day off\.

  
**Mihono:** So anyway, we're here to buy presents for the present exchange-\!  
**Kiyoka/Suu:** [clap clap clap\]\~\!  
**Mihono:** I'm glad Akira-san and Iwakura-san both said they're excited to do it\. Did you two already decide on what you're buying\?  
**Suu:** I actually have two things in mind\.\.\. Garden or Hell Angel Marvelous-chan; which one do you think I should try and make more fans of\!\?  
**Mihono:** Wh-Which one\.\.\. What are you gonna do if they go to Akira-san\?  
**Suu:** If Inago-san got those\.\.\.  
**Suu:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Suu:** Ah\.\.\.\.\.\. I think, I might die\.\.\. I'll buy something safe, like aroma oil\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Aroma oil, huh\. Then, I'll get\.\.\.  
**Cake Shop:** We're accepting reservations for Christmas cakes here-\.  
**Mihono:** Christmas cakes\.\.\. All creamy\.\.\. Okay, I'll go with moisturizer cream\!  
**Kiyoka:** Ahaha, only you would make up your mind like that, Hono-chan\. For mine\.\.\. Since it's Christmas, I think I'll get a snowglobe\.  
**Mihono:** Then, let's all split up and buy our stuff\!  
**Shopkeeper:** Thank you very much\~\.  
**Kiyoka:** Okay, I got a cute one\. All that's left is\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** (Gloves for Hono-chan\! I'll sneak over and buy her some\!\)  
**Kiyoka:** (Fufu, how happy will Hono-chan be when she gets them\?\)  

## 6: Ceremonial Guard (6\)
**Sanae:** Inago-san and the others sure are late\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** They are\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** I got a message from Hono-chan saying they were on their way a long time ago too\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Kiyoka-\! Iwakura-saaan\! S-Sorry we're late-\!  
**Akira:** Phew, we just barely made it in time\!  
**Suu:** Th-That was close\.\.\.  
**Sanae:** Did you run into trouble\?  
**Akira:** Nah, nothing like that happened today, so it's all good\. It's cause I had Mihono and Suu with me\.  
**Mihono:** Eh\!\?  
**Mihono:** (All that stuff happened, and she doesn't call that trouble\.\.\.\?\)  
**Suu:** (I'm never going to wake Inago-san up, no way\!\)  
**Sanae:** \.\.\.So anyway, let's split into two teams like we planned and start our guard duty\!  
**Mihono:** Hey, Kiyoka, Inami-san\.  
**Kiyoka:** What is it\?  
**Mihono:** The person who just went in, I feel like I've seen them somewhere before\.\.\. Do you know who that is\?  
**Suu:** Aren't they some politician\?  
**Kiyoka:** I'm not all that familiar either, but I'm pretty sure they're\.\.\. a high ranking government official\.  
**Mihono:** Ah, it's Friedman-san\!  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.He walked right by\.  
**Kiyoka:** It's understandable; he probably doesn't have time to stop and chat with us\.  
**Suu:** \.\.\.The party should be starting around now\.  

## 7: Ceremonial Guard (7\)
**Operator:** \.\.\.a suspicious person has been sighted\. Please head there at once\.  
**Security Officer:** Understood\.  
**Mihono:** Ever since the party started, there's reports of suspicious people one after another\.  
**Kiyoka:** With all these important people here, it's bound to happen\.  
**Mihono:** Is it okay for us to not be doing anything about it\?  
**Kiyoka:** The security officers will deal with anyone suspicious\. Our job is just to take care of if aradama appear\.  
**Suu:** Ehh\!\? Then, that training we did, and our special training\.\.\. There wasn't any point to Inago-san hazing us, was there\!\?  
**Kiyoka:** That's not true\! If we have to go fight an aradama, that special training will be worth it\!  
**Operator:** An appearance of aradama has been confirmed in the area of the academy\. Will Iwakura team please head to suppress it at once\.  
**Mihono:** There's aradama\!  
**Sanae:** Musumi-san, Asakura-san, Inami-san\. The place where the aradama appeared is closer to you three\! I need you to suppress it\!  
**All Three:** Right\!  
**Mihono:** Uwah--\!\? There's so many cars here\!\!  
**Suu:** It'll be tough making it down this road\.  
**Kiyoka:** It's alright\! I made sure to look things up for times like this\!  
**Kiyoka:** Hono-chan, Inami-san\! Over here\!  
**Mihono:** Ah, there's not a lot of traffic this way\!  
**Kiyoka:** While you three were training hard, I was preparing as best I could too\!  
**Mihono:** Nice going, Kiyoka\!  
**Aradama:** GYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Kiyoka:** \.\.\.There it is\!  
**Mihono:** Inami-san, let's do it just like we trained\!  
**Suu:** Sure\! Mihono-san\!  
**Mihono/Suu:** YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Aradama:** GYAA\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** Hono-chan, Inami-san, that was great\! You were perfectly coordinated\!  
**Mihono:** Eheh\! That's the combo that worked on Akira-san, after all\!  
**Mihono:** Let's keep it up like this\!  

## 8: Ceremonial Guard (8\)
**Sanae:** Now then\.\.\. Great work on our guard duty\! Let's start our celebration and Christmas party\!  
**Akira:** Cool, it's time to swap presents\! I got a special one ready, so look forward to it\.  
**Mihono:** I did my best to get something nice too, Akira-san\!  
**Sanae:** It's exciting waiting to see whose present you'll get, isn't it\?  
**Kiyoka:** It really is\!  
**Sanae:** Okay, now why don't we open the presents we're all holding\?  
**Akira:** Mine's\.\.\. Aroma oil\?  
**Suu:** Ah, that's the present I picked out\!  
**Akira:** Huh, thanks, Suu\!  
**Suu:** (That was close\.\.\. Thank god I didn't go with fan merch\!\)  
**Suu:** Mine's moisturizer cream, so\.\.\. Wasn't that from Mihono-san\?  
**Mihono:** I made sure to get some that smelled good\! I'll open mine next\! Oh, it's a handkerchief\!  
**Sanae:** Ah, that's the present I chose\. I tried to go with something that wouldn't trouble anybody\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** It's really cute, Iwakura-san\!  
**Sanae:** Thank goodness\. My one is\.\.\. It's a snowglobe\. How adorable\.\.\. Was this from you, Musumi-san\?  
**Kiyoka:** Yep\. Since it's Christmas and all, I went with a snowglobe\.  
**Akira:** So, that means Kiyoka must've got mine\. Go and open it\.  
**Kiyoka:** Okay\. This is\.\.\. a helmet\?  
**Akira:** Sure\! I'll give you a ride later on, after I can\!  
**Mihono:** You're so lucky, Kiyoka\! Akira-san, you have to let me ride with you too\!  
**Akira:** Course I will\!  
**Mihono:** Cool\!  
**Kiyoka:** \.\.\.Hono-chan\.  
**Mihono:** Huh\? What is it, Kiyoka\?  
**Kiyoka:** \.\.\.Could we talk outside for a minute\?  
**Mihono:** Ughh, it's cold\! What'd you need to bring me out here for, Kiyoka\?  
**Kiyoka:** \.\.\.Here's a present for you, Hono-chan\. They're new gloves\. I'd be glad if you used them\.  
**Mihono:** Thanks, Kiyoka\! You know\.\.\. I got a present for you too\!  
**Kiyoka:** Eh\!\? This is\.\.\. a bookmark\?  
**Mihono:** I know you like books, so\. Though, I was worried this one was a little too cheap\.  
**Kiyoka:** I don't think it's cheap at all\. I'm very happy with it\.\.\. Thank you, Hono-chan\!  
**Kiyoka:** This turned out to be a really nice Christmas\!
