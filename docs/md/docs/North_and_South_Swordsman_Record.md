## 1: In Order to Overcome These Hardships\!
**Inami Suu:** Hakobune Noa-chan... She's gotten better at MCing since last time, and when I went to shake her hand, she even remembered me\!  
**Suu:** And Sonomiya Eden-san winked at me too; this seriously made all the painful missions I've had to go through up till now worth it-\! 	[The kanji in their names are puns on Noah's Ark and the Garden of Eden]  
**Asahina Hokuto:** ......Right.  
**Suu:** They're trying so hard...  
**Suu:** You don't know how lucky we are we got tickets for such good seats. That's all thanks to you applying for the lottery for us, Hokuto-san\!  
**Suu:** Ah, what did you think, anyway? About Garden's mini-live concert\!  
**Hokuto:** This was my first time seeing an idol concert, so it felt very fresh...  
**Suu:** I'm glad you liked it then\~. I'll give you the CD and scarf towel I bought in case I could turn someone into a future fan\!  
**Hokuto:** Ah... Thank you. You really like those girls, don't you. I hadn't heard of these idols at all before though.  
**Suu:** Garden still has that feeling like, only those in the know know how good they are, so I'm not surprised-.  
**Suu:** Early on, the two of them both wanted to go solo, so they couldn't get along. Garden back then... You could say it was more of a wasteland.  
**Suu:** But, after all the times they fought, you can see now just how well they get together.  
**Hokuto:** Even though they fought, they turned out alright?  
**Suu:** They did\! At first, Noa-chan and Eden-san used to be so serious about their idol activities, and apparently they got in lots of arguments over where to take their careers.  
**Suu:** They said that, in order to decide who'd lead them, they had a bunch of battles, like, who could get the highest score in karaoke, or who could hold a smile the longest.  
**Suu:** But, as they did that, it made them start understanding each other better\! Isn't that so idol-like\!  
**Hokuto:** I don't exactly know... what is and isn't idol-like. But it's true that battling can be a way to bring people together.  
**Suu:** That whole story was another reason why I became a fan of theirs.  
**Suu:** I want to watch over them until the day they spread their wings and make it out into the big open sky of showbiz\!  
**Suu:** Doesn't seeing cute girls sing and dance just fill you with energy\!  
**Hokuto:** ...I think I understand you somewhat. It's the fruit of their efforts.  
**Suu:** After that... With the Renpu and Heijou joint-practice starting in three days...  
**Suu:** I think I might be able to make it... maybe... somehow.  
**Hokuto:** Be more assertive. Where did the energy you got from those girls go?  
**Suu:** I already used it all up. Ever since I got assigned to be a member of this, I've been depressed... So depressed.  
**Suu:** If you weren't going to be there, I would've faked being sick to get out of it\!  
**Hokuto:** Don't say that so shamelessly.  
**Suu:** ...The joint-practice this time, if only it were like the Five Traditions sponsored idol event they did before, then I could've just watched all the toji who became idols...  
**Hokuto:** Toji who... became idols?  
**Suu:** It's real; I'm not making it up\! They all... wore costumes, and sung and danced, and they were all sparkling.  
**Suu:** And I even thought that, maybe... I might find someone new to be a fan of there.  
**Hokuto:** ...I see.  
**Suu:** I've got it\! Why don't we go have fun somewhere tomorrow, so I can make it through the tough practice?  
**Hokuto:** What are you saying? Tomorrow we're going to be training for the practice.  
**Hokuto:** I came up with the perfect training regimen for you, Suu.  
**Suu:** Ehhhhh\!  
**Suu:** Why do I have to do training before the practice though... You'll make me die from exhaustion.  
**Hokuto:** You won't have to worry. I took into account your stamina and muscle mass while making this regimen.  
**Suu:** Hokuto-san, you'd go that far... for me.  
**Suu:** But that doesn't mean I have to do it... Right\!\?  
**Hokuto:** ...I went along with you to your event, so join me in training for a while. Just a little while is fine.  
**Suu:** Ahh-... I don't want to go to training or to practice.  
**Hokuto:** An aradama signal...?  
**People on the Streets:** A-ARADAMAAAA\!\?  
**Hokuto:** ...\!  
**Aradama:** ...GRRUUU\!  
**Hokuto:** We're going... Suu.  
**Suu:** C-Can't we at least wait for the toji in charge of the area to show up? Let's do that\!  
**Hokuto:** We can't. We mustn't turn a blind eye to aradama. Even if I have to go alone... I'm going.  
**Suu:** Ahh-, fine\~\~... I-I got it. I got it, okay, so please, don't go off on your ownnn...\!  
**Hokuto:** Thank you. Let's hurry.  
**Hokuto:** HAA\!  
**Aradama:** ......  
**Hokuto:** Kh... There are too many people... This could be bad.  
**Suu:** Hokutoo-saaaan... I can't go on any more-.  
**Hokuto:** Once backup arrives, this will be easier... Just hold out a little longer. You can still use utsushi, can't you?  
**Suu:** You said that a while ago\~\~...  
**Aradama:** ...GUGGGGI\!  
**Suu:** Awawawa... There's a really big one coming our way-\!\?  
**Sanae:** We're here to support you\!  
**Suu:** \!\!  
**Suu:** Th-Thank you so much, thank you so much...\!  
**Hiyori:** Iwakura-san, let's stop that aradama from moving first.  
**Sanae:** That would reduce the damage the most, wouldn't it.  
**Aradama:** ...GUOOOOOOO\!  

## 2: This Was Supposed to Be My Day off to Recharge...
**Sanae:** --There\!  
**Aradama:** ooo...\!\!  
**Hiyori:** --HAAAAAH\!  
**Hokuto:** Those two, we fought in the tournament qualifiers...  
**Suu:** If some strong girls are here, then we should leave it to them and evacuate\!  
**Hokuto:** I don't think that's going to happen. Don't lose heart now.  
**Aradama:** GRRRUUU...\!  
**Suu:** Why do they just keep coming one after the other...\!\?  
**Hokuto:** We can't afford to leave everything to just those two.  
**Hokuto:** YAAAAA-\!  
**Aradama:** ...uuuu\!\!  
**Sanae:** Great job.  
**Sanae:** Um, would you mind making a makeshift team with the four of us, to stop the aradama together? If we cooperate, I'm sure things will go more safely.  
**Hokuto:** I'd be glad to.  
**Suu:** I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't count me as part of that-\!  
**Sanae:** Err, but that's...  
**Hokuto:** The four of us will fight.  
**Suu:** Hey\!\?  
**Sanae:** Then, Asahina-san and Juujou-san will respond to aradama as they appear.  
**Sanae:** And, I'll go with the girl from Renpu, um...  
**Suu:** It's... Inami. But, just to be clear, I'm not any good at fighting\!  
**Sanae:** Mm, that's fine. Inami-san and I will watch for any coming from the rear or your blind spots, and support the two in the vanguard.  
**Sanae:** Also, we need to help with evacuations. There should be people who couldn't get away in time.  
**Sanae:** That's the basic plan of action, but what do you think?  
**Suu:** I feel like I should be the one evacuating right about now, but... I think I can do that...  
**Hokuto:** I don't see an issue with that either.  
**Hiyori:** Then, I'll be in your care.  
**Hokuto:** Of course, likewise.  
**Hiyori:** \! ...Looks like a new one showed up.  
**Aradama:** ...GGGIII\!  
**Sanae:** Inami-san. Let's leave that aradama to them for now and watch the perimeter\!  
**Suu:** I want to run I want to run I want to run I want to run... Uuuu...\!  
**Suu:** ...Maybe another toji will happen to be passing by and swap with me\!  

## 3: Before I Knew it, I was With Three Heijou Institute Girls\!
**Hokuto:** There were quite a lot of aradama, weren't there.  
**Suu:** S... So tireddd... I was looking forward to this day off too...  
**Sanae:** You did well. The toji in charge of the area are here, and the noro is being collected, so everything will be fine now.  
**Sanae:** Thankfully, almost none of the people who came to enjoy Harajuku were hurt either.  
**Hokuto:** Having your support made a huge difference, Juujou-san, Iwakura-san.  
**Sanae:** I think it's more because of how quickly you two engaged the aradama, Asahina-san.  
**Suu:** Umm-, do you three all know each other?  
**Hokuto:** I know these two. Though...  
**Hiyori:** I remember you too. We faced each other in the tournament qualifiers, after all.  
**Hokuto:** ...You remember that?  
**Hiyori:** Sure I do. You left an impression on me.  
**Sanae:** And, I knew you long before we competed in the qualifiers.  
**Hokuto:** You too, Iwakura-san...? I don't think we've ever spoken though. We haven't ever been on a mission together either.  
**Sanae:** You're pretty famous around Heijou, Asahina-san.  
**Sanae:** I hear a lot about the hard working senpai one year above us who spends an incredible amount of time training.  
**Hokuto:** Ahh, that's why. I don't push myself as hard as I used to though.  
**Suu:** No no no, you still train more than enough, Hokuto-san\! I feel like, if I didn't ask you to come out with me, you'd be stuck training again.  
**Hokuto:** What makes you think that...  
**Suu:** Cause, every time we get together, you're always trying to get me to practice with you, aren't you\!\?  
**Hokuto:** That's because you show a lot of promise, Suu. If you train properly, I know you'll become much stronger.  
**Suu:** ...But, it's not like I want to be stronger.  
**Hokuto:** Wouldn't that be a waste of your talents? You were chosen to be a part of this joint-practice as well, weren't you?  
**Suu:** That must've been a mistake... It has to be.  
**Hiyori:** You got selected too, Inami? Then that means all four of us will be at the practice.  
**Sanae:** That's right. Since we'll all be together, why don't we go get some ice cream for now?  
**Sanae:** There's a shop I was thinking of visiting before we ran into the aradama.  
**Suu:** Ah, I'd love to go\! This is how a day off should be\!  
**Hokuto:** With this many flavors... It's hard coming to a decision.  
**Hiyori:** I recommend the chocolate mint then.  
**Hiyori:** Ah, I mean, only if you're not sure. It's just my suggestion...  
**Hokuto:** Thank you. I'll give it a try.  
**Suu:** This mixed berry is so good\~\~\!  
**Sanae:** We were saying, next time we have a chance to come to Tokyo together, we had to come here.  
**Hiyori:** I'm glad we came.  
**Hokuto:** I've never really had chocolate mint before, but I think I might like this quite a bit.  
**Suu:** They've been having chocolate mint flavored sweets in convenience stores and places a lot lately, haven't they?  
**Hiyori:** \! Yeah, that's for sure.  
**Hiyori:** There really are some people who get it out there.  
**Hokuto:** By the way, have you two heard what exactly we'll be doing in this joint-practice?  
**Suu:** Ah\! Why didn't you ask me about that-?  
**Hokuto:** Well, you... You wouldn't have closely read over the notice and paperwork, would you?  
**Suu:** I did read them though...\! I wanted to see if there was anything scary sounding, or dangerous\!  
**Suu:** There wasn't a lot explained in them though...  
**Sanae:** I read through the paperwork after I was selected too, but it didn't say much, other than that its purpose was to strengthen our coordination.  
**Sanae:** By the way, I couldn't help but notice, but, even though you come from different schools, you two are awfully close, aren't you.  
**Suu:** We are\! Every time Hokuto-san is in town, we go out to have a good time, like we were doing today\!  
**Hokuto:** ...Though I just keep Suu company.  
**Hiyori:** Well... That kind of thing happens, even between girls from different schools...  
**Sanae:** Fufu, I think it's really nice to be like that.  
**Hokuto:** I do too.  
**Suu:** Ahh... Anyway, about the practice... I wonder what we'll be doing...  
**Suu:** Even if I know what we're doing, if I don't like it, I won't like it. But, not knowing what we'll be doing is scary... It's way too scary\!  
**Sanae:** I think I understand a little how you're feeling. But, if we just keep focused and work at it, it shouldn't be anything that'll hurt us.  
**Suu:** It's hard enough just trying not to get hurt...  
**Hokuto:** Suu. After coming this far, resolve yourself to see it through.  
**Suu:** ......  
**Hokuto:** If, in three days, either of you get paired with Suu at the joint-practice, please look after her.  
**Hiyori:** Sure, if we're together.  
**Sanae:** Of course, now that we've gotten to know each other here. Let's look after each other, Inami-san.  
**Suu:** ............Okay.  

## 4: Joint Training... It Started...
Before the start of the Renpu Heijou Joint-Training.

  
**Suu:** ...I'm overwhelmingly out of place here\!  
**Hokuto:** Could you not start shouting out of nowhere.  
**Suu:** But, will you... just look around\!  
**Kofuki:** ......  
**Hiyori:** ......  
**Sayaka:** ......  
**Sanae:** .....  
**Suu:** Not only is there Juujou-san and Iwakura-san we met in Harajuku the other day...  
**Suu:** There's girls like Itomi-san, who makes sure to finish any mission you give her, and that girl who loves fighting aradama way too much... Aradama-Must-Die-Man Shichinosato-san too\!  
**Hokuto:** I told you not to be so loud... They'll think it's rude if they hear you. And what's Aradama-Must-Die-Man anyway?  
**Suu:** ...That's slang for her.  
**Suu:** She loves fighting aradama and stuff. To where it's impossible to wrap your head around... Isn't she sort of scary...?  
**Suu:** Please God, I'm begging you... Don't put me in the same group as her...  
**Hokuto:** You're right that there are strong fighters here from both schools, but we're only here to train together. You're worrying too much.  
**Hokuto:** And besides, she's another student from Renpu, the same as you.  
**Suu:** That doesn't reassure me at a--  
**Suu:** ......  
**Hokuto:** ...What is it now? Why are you hiding behind me?  
**Suu:** There, over there... It's Tsubakuro-san... and Satsuki-san, from the elite guard.  
**Yume:** Yomi-onee-san, do I really have to be here for this too-?  
**Yomi:** You do. This is a part of our duties as the elite guard.  
**Yume:** What do we have to do?  
**Yomi:** We need to instruct everyone gathered here on the details of their training. Though, I believe Shidou-san and Konohana-san will handle most of that...  
**Yume:** Then, you don't need me, do you? If I don't get to fight all the strong people I want, then I want to go home-\!  
**Suu:** (I don't want to get involved with Tsubakuro-san... No, I don't want anything to do with anyone from the elite guard\!)  
**Suu:** (Back then... When we met in Okinawa, they were way too scary...\!)  
**Maki:** Well if it isn't Asahina Hokuto and Inami Suu.  
**Suu:** HYAAU\!\?  
**Maki:** ? What's wrong with her?  
**Hokuto:** Don't worry about her, Shidou-san. Anyway, what did you need?  
**Maki:** Nothing, just thought I'd say hi to you two. I'm sure this training will be helpful for you. I hope you'll make good use of it.  
**Hokuto:** Of course; we plan on it.  
**Maki:** It's about time for us to get started. Good luck out there.  
**Hokuto:** She was only saying hello. You're too jumpy.  
**Suu:** That was just, an irresistible force, or more like, a synergistic effect; a lot happened...  
**Suzuka:** This training is organized to drill you on small-scale group battles, but it has one other objective. That is--  
**Suzuka:** For you to be able to clearly convey your actions and intent to your allies in a short time, so that, even if you are partnered with someone new, you can work together to dispose of aradama.  
**Maki:** If there's an increase in aradama appearances, the amount of missions will go up too. In which case, you won't only be fighting with the companions you're used to.  
**Maki:** With that situation in mind, you'll be divided into groups by lottery. Don't go swapping your results after you draw them.  
**Maki:** Twenty minutes after the groups are assembled, we'll carry out group battles\!  
**Suu:** (Hokuto-san, Hokuto-san\! Please let me be with Hokuto-san\!)  
**Suu:** (Also, please don't let me be with anyone scary...\!\!)  
**Hokuto:** This is how it goes sometimes.  
**Suu:** Right, I'm so glad... God granted my prayers\!  
**Suu:** Or at least, half of them...  
**Kofuki:** What, there's no aradama-chan here? ...This sucks.  
**Kiyoka:** You shouldn't say things like that...  
**Hokuto:** I'm Asahina Hokuto, first year in the Heijou Institute's high school division. Nice to meet you.  
**Suu:** ......  
**Hokuto:** Come on, you say yours, Suu.  
**Suu:** I-I'm Inami Suu... second year in Renpu Girls' School's middle school division. Please go easy on me...  
**Kiyoka:** Ah, you're in the same year as me, Inami-san. I'm Musumi Kiyoka. It's nice to meet you.  
**Kofuki:** ...Do mine for me-.  
**Kiyoka:** ...Honestly, Kofuki-san.  
**Kiyoka:** This is Shichinosato Kofuki-san. She's a third year in middle school. We both work together in the Akabane swords investigation team.  
**Hokuto:** So you two already know each other as well. That's good then; it should be easy for us to coordinate.  
**Kiyoka:** Right. In this situation, what do you think we should go over first?  
**Hokuto:** It seems, right after this, we'll be having group mock battles. So why don't we decide on our roles in battle? We'll start with choosing an attacker.  
**Kofuki:** I'm not being the attacker. There's nothing fun about going up against other people.  
**Kiyoka:** ...Y-You can't be like that right from the get go.  
**Kofuki:** But there's no point in teams of toji fighting each other, is there? A toji's job is fighting aradama.  
**Suu:** ...I-Isn't that right?  
**Hokuto:** That's true. There might be some logic to what you're saying.  
**Kofuki:** Oh, nice to see you two get it.  
**Hokuto:** However, being able to coordinate with one another is more important than anything. That's why I won't consider this training a waste of our time.  
**Kofuki:** If that's how you feel, then you guys can do something about this yourselves.  
**Hokuto:** That won't do. If you won't participate seriously, this training will lose its meaning.  
**Hokuto:** And on top of that... If we aren't able to coordinate during our missions, you might be injured beyond recovery.  
**Kofuki:** ...Like I'm supposed to care.  
**Suu:** Uhh, umm... Why don't we all take some deep breaths and calm down first\!\?  
**Kiyoka:** ...Asahina-san is right, Kofuki-san. If you ended up getting hurt, I'd be upset.  
**Kofuki:** ...Tch.  
**Kofuki:** Fine, I get it. Let's just figure this out already.  

## 5: Coordinating All of a Sudden Is... Hard to Do
**Suu:** (The rule is that whichever group has the most people with utsushi removed loses, but everyone's going at it so seriously... It's scary.)  
**Suu:** (...I hope this ends soon. But, getting cut hurts, so I don't want that to happen...)  
**Suu:** (So, right now, this is all I can do...)  
**Suu:** --You can do it, Hokuto-san\!  
**Sayaka:** HAA\!  
**Hokuto:** Kh... She's quick\!  
**Kiyoka:** I'll be right--  
**Sanae:** I'm not letting you go, Musumi-san\!  
**Kiyoka:** Eh, when did you...\!\?  
**Sanae:** Now's our chance\!  
**Tsugumi:** Understood.  
**Kofuki:** You're actually taking this seriously... Really?  
**Tsugumi:** That's rude. I'm fundamentally a serious person, aren't I?  
**Tsugumi:** It would be a problem if they didn't think I was serious and our research funding was reduced-.  
**Tsugumi:** Though, you're not my opponent now anyway, Shichinosato-san.  
**Hokuto:** ...Suu, stand firm\!  
**Suu:** Thinking about it, they have to be coming after me, right--\!\?  
**Tsugumi:** Sorry about this. Anyway.  
**Suu:** NOOOOOO\!\?  
**Suu:** Even with utsushi, it still hurts... Uuu...  
**Kiyoka:** I know what you mean... It sure hurts, doesn't it. When you're being slashed, you can't help but flinch against it.  
**Suu:** Ahh, I'm so glad someone here understands\! Thank you, Musumi-san\!  
**Suu:** I can't be useful at all, so I... I'm thinking of withdrawing from this. I feel like that's the best way for me to contribute\!  
**Kiyoka:** Eh... P-Please, hold on a minute\!\? We'll be in trouble without you, Inami-san\!  
**Kiyoka:** And also, this is just a maybe, but... If Kofuki-san and Asahina-san can't coordinate, then this group won't...  
**Suu:** ...Right.  
**Hokuto:** ......  
**Kiyoka:** If you won't cooperate some more, we won't be able to practice anything...  
**Kofuki:** There's no aradama-chan here, so no thanks-.  
**Kiyoka:** ...But, didn't you say you understood that before?  
**Hokuto:** ......  
**Suu:** (Ah-... I think Hokuto-san's mad... I'm not even the one who made her mad, but I'm feeling sort of uneasy.)  
**Suu:** (I wish that someone would step in and reconcile this... Even someone from the elite guard would be fine, just, won't someone stop them?)  
**Yume:** Nn-? Huh, Onee-san?  
**Suu:** Ah, I didn't mean it after all\!  
**Yume:** Didn't mean what?  
**Suu:** ...It's nothing.  
**Yume:** I think I might've seen you before. Did we meet somewhere, Onee-san?  
**Suu:** Ehh-... Ahh-... Umm-... Uhh-...  
**Suu:** (What should I do, what should I do... Maybe it'd be fine if I said honestly, we met last year in Okinawa? But, but, if I pretend like she's got the wrong person, maybe she'll lose interest and go away\!\?)  
**Yume:** I can't tell what you mean when you just say "Uhh-...", Onee-san.  
**Suu:** Th-There's no way we could have met anywhere before, Tsubakuro-sama...  
**Yume:** Why're you calling me Tsubakuro-sama even though I'm younger? Wait, this feels familiar for some reason...  
**Suu:** AWAWA...\! Umm, umm... It looks like you elite guard are having another tough day of work, huh\!  
**Yume:** Not really-... There's nothing to do, so I'm just bored. It's not like I get to fight anybody strong either-.  
**Yume:** I'm tired of this, so I'm going to go play with Yukari-sama\! Bye bye\~.  
**Suu:** Tsubakuro-san... You're as free spirited as ever... I'm jealous...  
**Announcer:** We are beginning the next match, so will the following groups please prepare straight away.  

## 6: How Did it Come to This...?
**Maki:** So each group has gone through a number of battle exercises at this point. Hm...  
**Maki:** (Though, there's groups that are coordinating well, and those that aren't. The difference is greater than I was expecting.)  
**Maki:** (Even when you gather nothing but people greatly skilled at fighting, they might not function properly as a team in some cases.)  
**Maki:** (Asahina and Shichinosato's coordination is going to take time to improve, won't it...)  
**Maki:** (Getting rid of ignorance within a unit is another part of this training's goals. I'll watch them carefully for now.)  
**Suu:** We lost again, didn't we...  
**Kofuki:** The hell, I fought like you told me to, didn't I? And anyway, she's barely fighting worth anything either.  
**Suu:** Ah, that's true...  
**Kiyoka:** Hey... Kofuki-san\!  
**Kiyoka:** U-Um... Try not to let it get you down, Inami-san.  
**Hokuto:** It's true that, with how fearful Suu is acting, I can't call her an asset to the team.  
**Hokuto:** Even when I put her through training whenever we meet, I wouldn't say she's very enthusiastic.  
**Suu:** Hokuto-san, even if it's true, when you say it out loud... You're making me depressed.  
**Hokuto:** But, you should be capable of fighting harder than that. Shichinosato-san.  
**Kofuki:** Yeah and, what about it?  
**Hokuto:** I understand full well that you won't get serious unless you're fighting against aradama.  
**Hokuto:** However, I'd hate it if this training went on like this. We were given the chance to participate, so I don't want it to go to waste.  
**Hokuto:** Which is why...  
**Suu:** They did\! At first, Noa-chan and Eden-san used to be so serious about their idol activities, and apparently they got in lots of arguments over where to take their careers.  
**Suu:** They said that, in order to decide who'd lead them, they had a bunch of battles, like, who could get the highest score in karaoke, or who could hold a smile the longest.  
**Suu:** But, as they did that, it made them start understanding each other better\! Isn't that so idol-like\!  
**Hokuto:** I don't exactly know... what is and isn't idol-like. But it's true that battling can be a way to bring people together.  
**Hokuto:** ...Let's settle this with a match. What do you say we agree the loser will obey the winner for the remainder of this training?  
**Kofuki:** ...Huh?  
**Hokuto:** If you win, I won't complain.  
**Kofuki:** Have you got muscles for brains or what...?  
**Kofuki:** But, fine. If I win, then this lameass argument's done with too.  
**Suu:** E-Eh... Is it really okay for you to duel like this?  
**Hokuto:** It's not a duel. This is simply practice in the form of a standard match. Move away.  
**Suu:** You can't go pushing yourself too hard just because your leg injury healed.  
**Hokuto:** Thank you. I know.  
**Kiyoka:** You could have just done the practice properly.  
**Kofuki:** It's fine.  
**Kofuki:** Let's get this started already.  
**Hokuto:** I'm ready anytime.  
**Kofuki:** Then I'll get right to it--\!  
**Hokuto:** You are strong... But\!  
**Hokuto:** --HAAA\!  
**Kofuki:** Tch...  
**Suu:** What's going to happen...  
**Kiyoka:** ...Mm.  
**Yomi:** It seems like some people have started a match on their own...  
**Maki:** Wait, just leave them for now. If the situation gets worse, we'll step in.  
**Maki:** Hopefully this can bring about some kind of change in that group.  
**Suzuka:** Maki-san, it seems a mass outbreak of aradama has occurred in Harajuku just now.  
**Maki:** ...\!  
**Suzuka:** I only just got the report. This joint-training has been changed to a joint-operation. The elite guard are to direct their suppression.  
**Maki:** Got it. Let's hurry\!  
**Hokuto:** It seems like now's not the time for our match.  
**Kofuki:** Sounds like a whole load of aradama-chan are out there. Good thing I joined in on this training.  
**Hokuto:** We'll be up against aradama, so I'll be depending on you readily.  
**Suu:** Ahhh, why did this have to happen-\!\?  

## 7: Everyone's... Pretty Motivated, Aren't They?
**Yomi:** From here, you will be organized into units formed by two or three groups from the earlier practice... and undertake this mission in Harajuku.  
**Yomi:** These may be hasty arrangements, but... I ask you all for your support.  
**Hiyori:** ...The silver lining is this happened while we were here training. With all these people, we can take care of it quick.  
**Sayaka:** Mm... I want to show what we've learned from training.  
**Suu:** Ahhh... Even though the training was hard, I thought we wouldn't be in any danger at least...  
**Suu:** Ah--\!\?  
**Suu:** With all these amazing people here, do they really need me? They don't need me, do they\!  
**Hokuto:** That won't do. This is your mission too, so you need to handle it properly.  
**Suu:** But I think I'm definitely not needed here... Sigh... It's scary; I don't want to fight any aradama.  
**Kiyoka:** I understand the way you're feeling. Me too... I don't want to have to fight if I can help it.  
**Suu:** ...Musumi-san\!  
**Suu:** (They give me support and they help me out; maybe I can depend on people from Heijou...?)  
**Suu:** I'll keep being in your care then\!  
**Kiyoka:** Nn? ...Mmhm, likewise.  
**Tsugumi:** Shichinosato-san, I'm relying on you to get me aradama data.  
**Kofuki:** Yeah, count on it.  
**Suu:** (Ah... Thinking about this the other way around, with all these strong people here, doesn't that make this a really safe mission?)  
**Suu:** Shichinosato-san's started looking all excited too.  
**Kiyoka:** That's usually how she is before we go on a mission.  
**Kofuki:** You better be letting me play with some aradama-chan tough enough to be worth it, okay?  
**Maki:** No need to worry about that. We're expecting a lot from the group with you, Itomi, and Juujou.  
**Maki:** The site you're going to has a high number of outbreaks.  
**Sayaka:** Understood.  
**Suu:** Ahhhhh... Why do you want to go to the most dangerous places?  
**Suu:** (I just don't get it... Are Shichinosato-san and Itomi-san actually space aliens or something...?)  
**Hokuto:** Don't make that face. If it comes down to it, I'll be there to save you.  
**Suu:** Hokuto-san... I won't leave your side\!\!  
**Hokuto:** Then we wouldn't be able to fight, would we...?  
**Suu:** ...Are you feeling that motivated for this?  
**Hokuto:** I am. It's rare to join a mission alongside a select group of top fighters. There's nothing to dislike about it.  
**Kiyoka:** I am feeling a little nervous, but let's try our best to keep up, Asahina-san, Inami-san.  
**Hokuto:** Of course. It looks like we're about to start. Let's go.  
**Suu:** Ahhh\~...  

## 8: That's Why I Said I Didn't Want to Do This...
**Hokuto:** YAAH\!  
**Hokuto:** Leave the smaller sized aradama to us. Could you handle that big aradama\!  
**Tsugumi:** Don't worry about any coming up behind you, Itomi-san, Juujou-san.  
**Hiyori:** Got it. Let's go, Sayaka.  
**Sayaka:** Mm... We'll finish this quickly.  
**Kofuki:** What's wrong, what's wrong\!  
**Aradama:** GUOOOOOO...\!\!  
**Kofuki:** Oh\! Looks like you wanna keep going; so I'll play with you\!  
**Kiyoka:** It feels like more and more aradama keep coming here...  
**Kiyoka:** Kofuki-san, if it's possible, let's try sticking close together to fight\!  
**Kiyoka:** Ah, she ran off. Please come baaaack\!  
**Kofuki:** Just gimme a minute.  
**Aradama:** ...GUGGGI\!  
**Suu:** ...Waaahh\!\? They came this way\!\?  
**Suu:** I feel like I'm in danger; I'm running away\!  
**Kiyoka:** Not you too, Inami-san\!\? There's still aradama that way\!  
**Aradama:** ......  
**Kofuki:** This's it for you--  
**Suu:** Save me... pleaseeeeee...\!  
**Kofuki:** Huh\!\? Hey... You're getting in the way of the good part\!  
**Suu:** Buttt...  
**Kofuki:** Well, I'll give you credit for bringing me more aradama-chan at least\!  
**Aradama:** ...GGGII\!  
**Suu:** Eeeeeek\!\?  
**Kiyoka:** ...Inami-san\!\? Whatever you do, keep your utsushi up\!  
Elsewhere, Hokuto and the others were--

  
**Hiyori:** Things are taken care of over here.  
**Hiyori:** It was a real help having you handle the aradama following the big one around, Asahina-san, Ban-san.  
**Sayaka:** Mm... We could focus on it thanks to you and Tsugumi.  
**Tsugumi:** No need to thank us. It's our mission.  
**Hokuto:** I only did what I was capable of.  
**Hokuto:** (Itomi Sayaka, Juujou Hiyori... They really are strong.)  
**Hokuto:** (It's not that I think I'll get the chance to become that strong just by completing missions with them, but, a toji's strength... There might be no limit to it.)  
**Hokuto:** (Though... Why are there this many talented individuals in one group to begin with?)  
**Screaming Voice:** EEEEEEKK\!\?  
**Screaming Voice:** SOMEBODY HELP MEEEEEEEEEE...\!  
**Hiyori:** Just now; that's...\!  
**Hokuto:** ...It's Suu. Let's hurry.  
**Suu:** Musumi-san... Shichinosato-san\! I'm begging you... I'm begging you, so... Hurry\!  
**Kofuki:** There's still way more aradama-chan to go through, so sit put\!  
**Kiyoka:** Inami-san, you reapplied utsushi just now, didn't you? That makes the third time... There aren't a lot of toji who can reuse utsushi that much.  
**Sayaka:** We came to save you, but, you seem okay...?  
**Suu:** I'm not okay at all... At all\!  
**Sayaka:** I saw you reapply utsushi just now. You can still fight.  
**Suu:** I've been in a huge pinch this whole time\!  
**Hokuto:** She can still fight. Suu can use utsushi even more than this.  
**Suu:** Why are you telling them that\!\?  
**Sayaka:** That's amazing...  
**Kofuki:** In that case, you can keep on being aradama bait for me\!  
**Suu:** Ehhhhh\!\?  
**Aradama:** ......  
**Tsugumi:** Certain data does indicate that aradama also tend to attack weaker seeming targets. Though it's still in need of verification.  
**Suu:** Don't just decide that on your own...\!\! I'm not an aradama charmer, okay\!\?  
**Sayaka:** You don't need to worry. We'll protect you, Suu.  
**Suu:** Th-Thank you very much\!  
**Suu:** But still, I want you to save me right now\! Get me out of this situation...\!  

## 9: If Possible... I'd Like a Break From Missions for a While 
**Suu:** Eep\!\?  
**Tsugumi:** Are you doing alright-?  
**Suu:** I just got a little spooked by the sound of okatana hitting an aradama...  
**Suu:** Even though I realize everyone's getting rid of the aradama.  
**Tsugumi:** I see. Though, Inami-san, it seems like you can use utsushi a great number of times, so if you were able to overcome your fears facing aradama, it would be very unlikely you would get hurt.  
**Suu:** Thinking about it is one thing, but actually doing it is a whole different story.  
**Tsugumi:** I understand. Raw data gathered from aradama will be biased, so it's vital to see the aradama moving about up close like this as well.  
**Tsugumi:** Today is looking to be an auspicious day, with all the aradama I've gotten to see and the data to collect.  
**Suu:** Ah.  
**Suu:** (This person too... She's dangerous after all\!)  
**Suu:** (I don't know how many times I've thought this now, but... Let this be over already-\!)  
**Kiyoka:** I'm leading this aradama over towards you\!  
**Kofuki:** Sure\! Don't worry about beating 'em, just keep sending more and more aradama-chan my way\!  
**Kiyoka:** We're only doing it like this for today, okay?  
**Kofuki:** I'm more than happy to do this anytime though.  
**Hokuto:** Shichinosato-san\! Would it be alright for me to send one more aradama at you then?  
**Kofuki:** I'll take any of them you've got\!  
**Kofuki:** Step right up, fresh aradama-chan\!  
**Hokuto:** (We weren't at all able to reach the coordination we were working towards during practice, in the end.)  
**Hokuto:** (With Shichinosato-san, we could hardly even take a formation.)  
**Kiyoka:** Honestly... You're only paying attention to the aradama that come right in front of you.  
**Hokuto:** (But outside of practice, Shichinosato-san is like a different person.)  
**Hokuto:** (And Musumi-san, understanding her nature, smoothly supports her while fighting the aradama.)  
**Hokuto:** I can't let myself lose here either... can I.  
**Sanae:** Great work, everyone-. Today was a little rough on us, huh.  
**Hiyori:** Were you in charge of leading a different group, Iwakura-san?  
**Sanae:** Mmhm. I was working together with the people from my group to stop the aradama from leaving the predicted area, and also helping escort anyone who couldn't evacuate on time.  
**Sayaka:** I wouldn't really be able to do that.  
**Sanae:** Everyone has their own role. I wouldn't be able to fight like you can either, Itomi-san.  
**Hiyori:** Sayaka. Since there were so many aradama, you must have taken out a lot of them, right?  
**Sayaka:** I stopped remembering how many halfway.  
**Hokuto:** If we're comparing numbers, you would have gotten the most, wouldn't you?  
**Kofuki:** Probably-. I got to play with so many aradama-chan I couldn't even keep up counting, so I'm satisfied.  
**Kofuki:** I've got her to thank for that too.  
**Hokuto:** Suu wouldn't feel so fortunate though... You really do love to fight aradama, don't you.  
**Hokuto:** I can't overlook that you ignored both orders and the unit's formation, but adaptability is a necessity, and I admire your dedication to the mission.  
**Hokuto:** I suppose it's fine so long as you don't cause any trouble for the girls you're assigned to work with.  
**Kofuki:** Heh, Kiyoka can handle it so it's all good.  
**Suu:** I don't know how many times I thought I was going to die today... I mean it, I'm on my last legs.  
**Hokuto:** Though, since you weren't hurt in the end, it turned out fine.  
**Suu:** No way; this time was bad enough that I want a special vacation or something. My heart took more than enough damage\!  
**Maki:** What's this? I'd heard Inami was about to drop from exhaustion, but you look lively enough to me.  
**Suu:** Shidou-san\!\? D-Did you need something from us?  
**Maki:** Nothing in particular. Just checking in on the toji who took part in the mission.  
**Hokuto:** You elite guard must have had your hands full too. Though, there's something on my mind. Mind if I ask you?  
**Maki:** Go right ahead.  
**Hokuto:** Whichever way you look at it, don't you think the group Suu and I were put in had an excessive amount of fighting strength?  
**Maki:** Ahh, that's what you mean. The plan was always to make one team of more average ability and one with more capable fighters.  
**Maki:** Just in order to counter any powerful aradama that appeared. On top of that, there were a lot of unique individuals, so it was Suzuka's thinking that having them all in one place would make them easier to manage.  
**Hokuto:** ...Because of that, we had a lot of trouble.  
**Suu:** And I... I ended up being some kind of aradama bait... It was the worst.  
**Maki:** ...That must have been difficult. Though, while the average level of students chosen for this training was high, not many could keep up with that group you were in.  
**Maki:** Knowing you two, I suggested you. And, it doesn't look like I was wrong.  
**Suu:** Sigh... Just because I can use utsushi a little more than usual, I wish you wouldn't forget how weak I am...  
**Sayaka:** I... I want to see how many times you can apply utsushi.  
**Suu:** I-Itomi-sama\!\? How long have you been here for\!\?  
**Sayaka:** Not long. I saw you from the front entrance.  
**Sayaka:** But, why are you using "sama"? I'm... not that important.  
**Suu:** Itomi-sama... You're way too strong, aren't you... So that's why\!  
**Sayaka:** There are toji stronger than me. ...You can call me Sayaka.  
**Suu:** No no no... There's no way I could say your name that bluntly\! At least let me use Sayaka-san\!\!  
**Sayaka:** Alright. And... How many more times can you apply utsushi, Suu? I want to see.  
**Suu:** How many more times...? I'm all out of stock for today, so I can't show you any more utsushis\!  
**Sayaka:** That's a shame...  
**Sayaka:** But, we go to the same school. I'll look forward to when we go on missions together.  
**Suu:** It's not like it's any fun to see either...  
**Hokuto:** ......  
**Suu:** Hokuto-san, why do you look like you're enjoying this. You're a bully.  
**Hokuto:** That's not what I was smiling about. I was just thinking, it might have been difficult, but this was a good experience for you.  
**Hokuto:** If nothing comes up, I won't be leaving for another two days, so do you want to go out somewhere and enjoy ourselves tomorrow?  
**Suu:** Absolutely\! I'll start coming up with a list of places to go right now\!  
**Hokuto:** You really do change moods at the drop of a hat, don't you.
