## 1: Not Like I Dislike It\!
**Akira:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Nene:** Ne\?  
**Toji A:** Hey\.\.\. Look\.  
**Toji B:** Y-Yeah\.\.\. Inago-san, she's glaring at\.\.\.  
**Akira:** \.\.\.\.\.\.What're you looking at\!\?  
**Both of Them:** S-Sorry about that\!  
**Akira:** \.\.\.\.\.\.Tch\.  
**Toji A:** She went away\.\.\.  
**Toji B:** You think it'd be a good idea if we told Mashiko-san about this\.\.\.\?  
**Toji A:** Yeah, just to be safe\.  
**Akira:** (He's too damn cute\!\)  
**Akira:** (Ahh\.\.\. I want to pet him so bad\.\.\.\)  
**Akira:** (But, y'know\.\.\. With how I look and all, there's no way I could rub him all over and be like \"Aww, there there\!\"\.\.\.\)  
**Akira:** Sigh, not when somebody's watching\.\.\.  
**Akira:** (Nene didn't seem freaked out, so if those two weren't there, I could've pet him at least\.\.\.\)  
**Akira:** \.\.\.When am I even gonna get another chance to pet Nene\.\.\.  
**Nene:** Zzz\.\.\.  
**Akira:** (Wh-What's goin' on here-\!\?\)  
**Akira:** I-Is he asleep\.\.\.\?  
**Nene:** Nene\.\.\.  
**Akira:** I-Is anybody around to see\.\.\.\? D-Doesn't look like it\.\.\.  
**Akira:** (What the hell; what's with this\! This is my big chance\!\)  
**Nene:** Ne\.\.\.  
**Akira:** I-I could\.\.\. Pet him right now\.\.\.  
**Nene:** \.\.\.  
**Akira:** B-Bring it on, damnit\! I'm gonna pet the hell outta you\!  
**Kaori:** Oiiii, Nene-\!  
**Nene:** Ne\!  
**Akira:** -\!\?  
**Nene:** Nenene\!\!  
**Kaoru:** What, you were lying around here\? We're going back now\.  
**Nene:** Ne\!\!  
**Akira:** \.\.\.\.\.\.Sighhhh, he's gone\. \.\.\.This sucks\.  
**Akira:** I'm not letting you get away next time, y'hear\!  

## 2: Prone to Happenings
**Akira:** Give me another good ride today\~\! 	[Delinquents do a thing where they replace characters in words with homonyms that have negative connotations or are just messier looking\. So for example, Akira says \"yoroshiku/let's get along\", but the \"shi\" is the kanji for death and \"ku\" is the kanji for suffering\.\]  
**Old Lady:** \.\.\.Oh my, what should I do\. There's too many cars going by\.\.\.  
**Akira:** -\!  
**Akira:** Oi\! Hey you, granny\!  
**Old Lady:** Eeek\!\?  
**Old Lady:** Thank you, toji dear\.  
**Akira:** It's nothing\. If some old granny's in trouble, wouldn't anybody help 'em out\?  
**Old Lady:** You're a good toji, aren't you, dearie\. Tell me, why do you dress so wild\?  
**Akira:** It's kinda my policy, I guess\.  
**Old Lady:** Oh dear, maybe I shouldn't have asked about that\. Fufu, this granny needs to get going now\.  
**Old Lady:** Here, you keep this\.  
**Akira:** Hey, thanks, granny\.  
**Akira:** \.\.\.Whoa, look at the time\! School's gonna be over again if I don't floor it\.  
**Police:** Hey\! You there\!  
**Akira:** Huh\?  
**Police:** You\! I'm talking to you\! You were threatening the elderly just now, weren't you\!  
**Akira:** Threatening-- She just gave me candy\!\?  
**Police:** You stole food from her\!\?  
**Akira:** C'mon, listen to what I'm telling you\!  
**Akira:** Ahh\.\.\. I'm beat\. And I didn't even make it to school in the end\!  
**Fukuda Sawano:** Oh\.\.\. Inago-san\.\.\.\?  
**Sawano:** (Did she just get back\? She looks angry about something\.\.\.\)  
**Akira:** Fuck\! Might as well just go to bed\!  
**Sawano:** (She didn't come to school again today\.\.\. What has she been up to\?\)  
--First thing in the morning\.

  
**Akira:** If I leave this early, I'll make it for sure\! I'm definitely getting to school today\!  
**Akira:** Nn\? Did I just run up on something, or what\.\.\. Geh\!\? I popped another tire\!\?  
**Akira:** How many times is that this month\!\? I don't got the money to fix another hole-\! But, it's not like I can leave it here either\.\.\. Guess I've gotta push\.\.\.  
**Akira:** Pant, pant\.\.\. M-Made it, finally\.\.\.  
**Aoto Hina:** Oh, did you pop a tire\?  
**Akira:** Huhh\? Who're you supposed to be\?  
**Hina:** I'm Aoto Hina; a second year in high school at Renpu Girls' Academy\. I'm from the swordsmithing department\.  
**Akira:** Ahh\.\.\.  
**Akira:** Sorry 'bout that, didn't know you were my senpai\. I'm a first year in high school, from the toji department\. Inago Akira\.  
**Hina:** Ooh, from the toji department\! In that case, have you heard of Aoto-kan, in Harajuku\?  
**Akira:** I've heard of it\.\.\.  
**Hina:** Well, that's my family's business\. If your okatana's giving you trouble, be sure to come on by Aoto-kan, and we'll\.\.\. Wait, that's not it\.  
**Hina:** Uhh, you popped your tire, right\?  
**Akira:** Ah, yep\.  
**Hina:** I thought so\. Um, if it's okay with you, want me to fix it\?  
**Hina:** There's someone at Renpu who rides a bike too, so I've fixed a popped tire before\.  
**Akira:** You don't got to be so polite\. Anyway, I'd appreciate it, Hina-san\.  
**Hina:** We're in business\!  
**Akira:** (I'm saved\. Still, there's somebody who rides a bike at Renpu\? I'd like to meet 'em someday\.\)  

## 3: Bike Buddy
**Akira:** \.\.\.Phew\.  
**Watanuki Kazumi:** You there\!  
**Akira:** Huh\?  
**Kazumi:** That bike of yours\.\.\.  
**Akira:** Hey, I've got a license and everything, okay\? If you still wanna give me a hard time then\.\.\.  
**Kazumi:** No, that's not what I meant\.  
**Kazumi:** I'm sorry, this is the first time I've met another person who rides a bike, so I couldn't help myself\.  
**Akira:** A biker from Renpu\.\.\.  
**Akira:** Ah, don't tell me, you're the one Hina-san was talking about\.\.\.  
**Kazumi:** I see I wasn't mistaken\.  
**Kazumi:** I thought you might have been the toji from Minoseki whose punctured tire Hina-san helped repair\.  
**Akira:** Thanks for today, Kazumi-san\.  
**Kazumi:** No, I'm the one who should be thanking you\. For a toji of your ability to be so unknown was an honest surprise\.  
**Akira:** Well, y'know\. Anyway, how long've you been biking for, Kazumi-san\?  
**Kazumi:** As soon as I was able to get my license, I did\. That would have been about two years ago\.  
**Akira:** Then, you must be way more experienced than me\!  
**Kazumi:** Why did you decide to start riding a bike, Akira-san\?  
**Akira:** At first, I sort of admired them\. Then, after I tried riding one, it was like I was floating on air\.\.\. I got totally hooked after\.  
**Kazumi:** Yes, I understand that feeling\. And it's as if the world opens up for you, isn't it\?  
**Kazumi:** In the beginning, I only got my license thinking it would be useful for travel\. But I found I greatly enjoyed it after I started riding\.\.  
**Akira:** I know, right\! It's the best\!  
**Kazumi:** So then, Akira-san\. If it would be alright with you, would you like to ride together sometime\?  
**Akira:** Me and you\? That'd be great\!  
**Akira:** There's nobody else I get to talk about bikes this much with, so this was fun as hell\.  
**Kazumi:** The same goes for myself\. In that case, on our next holiday, let's go on a high speed tour\.  
**Akira:** Sure thing\!  

## 4: Old Friends
**Akira:** Yo, let's get something to eat, Yomi\.  
**Yomi:** \.\.\.Akira\.  
**Yomi:** I'm busy with the preparations for the tournament, so I don't have the time to spare\.  
**Maki:** Do you know her\?  
**Yomi:** She's someone from my hometown\.  
**Akira:** Just tell her we're childhood friends\. What're you, embarrassed\?   
**Yomi:** \.\.\.She's an old friend\.  
**Maki:** I see\.  
**Maki:** In that case, why don't you go with her\? I'll do what I can to make progress here\.  
**Akira:** See\? Listen to that\.  
**Yomi:** \.\.\.I'm sorry, Shidou-san\. I'll be going out for a bit\.  
**Akira:** Time to dig in-\.  
**Yomi:** \.\.\.  
**Akira:** You not gonna eat anything, Yomi\?  
**Yomi:** You're too pushy, Akira\.  
**Akira:** Shidou Maki said it was fine, so what's the problem\?  
**Akira:** Come on, eat up\. The set today's pretty good\.  
**Yomi:** \.\.\.Today's rice was well cooked\. It's delicious\.  
**Akira:** You love rice the same as ever, huh\.  
**Yomi:** Rice is delicious\.  
**Yomi:** \.\.\.You've changed, Akira\. In the past, you wouldn't have worn those delinquent looking clothes\.  
**Yomi:** What would auntie say if she saw\?  
**Akira:** Hey, she said I could do whatever I pleased\?  
**Akira:** Anyway, you're the one who changed\. You turned into a total goody two shoes\.  
**Yomi:** I haven't changed at all\.  
**Akira:** You should go home sometime\. You're making auntie lonely, y'know\?  
**Yomi:** \.\.\.Do you go back home, Akira\?  
**Akira:** Sure, all the time\. It's a quick ride on a bike\.  
**Yomi:** \.\.\.  
**Akira:** Oh, and y'know Mucchan\? Well, she\.\.\.  
**Yomi:** Why didn't you participate in the tournament qualifiers\? Shouldn't you have been able to become a representative\?  
**Akira:** Ahh, I caught a cold\.  
**Yomi:** That side of you hasn't changed\. You always fell apart before a big occasion\.  
**Akira:** I couldn't sleep that night, no matter what\. How can you sleep before something like that\?  
**Yomi:** I sleep normally\.  
**Yomi:** \.\.\.Thank you for the meal\. I'll be going back now\.  
**Akira:** Thanks for joining me\. We should eat again sometime soon\.  
**Yomi:** \.\.\.We should\.  
**Yomi:** Let's have rice together again\.  

## 5: Hang in There, Mihono
**Nagae Futaba:** (For today's aradama suppression mission\.\.\.\)  
**Akira:** \.\.\.  
**Futaba:** (AHHH\!\? For some reason, the girl I'm paired up with looks super scaryyyyyy\!\?\)  
**Futaba:** Oi, you\!  
**Futaba:** Y-Yes, what is it\!\?  
**Akira:** There's aradama\!  
**Futaba:** Huh\!\? The spectrum meter hasn't picked anything up yet\.\.\.  
**Futaba:** H-How'd you know they were here\!\?  
**Akira:** Just my intuition\!  
**Akira:** One, two, three\.\.\. Bring it on\! Be sure you keep up\!  
**Futaba:** R-Right\!  
**Akira:** ORAORAORAORA\!  
**Futaba:** Ehh\!\?  
**Futaba:** (Sh-She's so strong\!\? Nobody told me there was a senpai this strong here\!\?\)  
**Akira:** Well, that's all there is to it\.  
**Futaba:** You ended up beating them all on your own\.\.\.  
**Akira:** Hey\.  
**Futaba:** Y-Yes\!\?  
**Akira:** You're in the same class as Asakura Mihono, right\?  
**Futaba:** Mihono\.\.\. What about her\?  
**Akira:** What do you think of her\?  
**Futaba:** She's my rival\!  
**Futaba:** Ahh, but, she's my rival, but we're friends too, and I guess if I had to say anything, she's a good person\.\.\.  
**Futaba:** Basically\.\.\. Yeah, she's my rival\!  
**Akira:** \.\.\.What was your name again\?  
**Futaba:** It's Futaba, Nagae Futaba\.  
**Akira:** Futaba, huh\. Keep at it\. Nothing's wrong with anybody who keeps their buddy close\.  
**Futaba:** Right\! \.\.\.Actually, Inago-senpai, why were you asking about Mihono\?  
**Akira:** I'm just, a little interested in her\.  
**Akira:** (We're going to need the power she's got\.\.\. So that our wish can happen\.\.\.\)  
**Futaba:** (EHHHHHHHHHHHHHH\!\? Sh-She's interested\? Interested how\!\?\)  
**Futaba:** (Don't tell me\.\.\. She got on this delinquent's bad side\!\?\)  
**Futaba:** H-Hang in there, Mihono\!  
**Akira:** Huh\?  

## [Akira Joins: Start\]: A Hero Arrives Late
**Aradama:** GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.\! Hey-\!\!  
**Mihono:** Pant\.\.\. Pant\.\.\.  
**Toji:** Wh-What should we do, Asakura-san\.\.\. There's too many aradama here\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** We just have to hold out a little longer\! I'm sure backup will show up by then\!  
**Toji:** O-Okay\.\.\.  
**Aradama:** UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU\!\!  
**Toji:** KYAAAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Mihono:** You\.\.\.\! HAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Mihono:** Are you okay\!\?  
**Toji:** Y-Yeah\.\.\. But, sorry\. I can't use utsushi anymore\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** That sound; it's--\!\?  
**Akira:** You alright\!\?  
**Mihono:** Akira-san\!\!  
**Akira:** Oh, you're here too, Mihono\? How's the situation\?  
**Mihono:** We're in big trouble\!  
**Akira:** Is anybody hurt here\?  
**Mihono:** Nope\!  
**Akira:** Alright, good to hear\! Let's get straight to beating down these aradama\!  
**Mihono:** Right\!  
**Mihono:** I-I'm totally beat\.\.\.  
**Akira:** What, that's all it takes for you to give up\? You're such a lightweight\.  
**Mihono:** I was fighting the whole time waiting for you to get here, you know\!  
**Akira:** Don't get mad at me\. I came as fast as I could when I heard the news, alright\?  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.Thanks for coming to help\.  
**Akira:** Alright, you're off the hook\.  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.You saved us by coming here, Akira-san\.  
**Mihono:** If you'd been just a little later\.\.\. I think we would've been in real trouble\.  
**Akira:** You should be thanking this then, not me\.  
**Mihono:** You mean\.\.\. Your bike\?  
**Akira:** Yep\. It ran its heart out racing over here\.\.\. Want to get on it for a bit\?  
**Mihono:** Can I\!\?  

## [Akira Joins: End\]: Soon Enough
**Mihono:** Can I really\!\? Your bike's so cool, Akira-san\!  
**Akira:** Hey, you get it, don't you\.  
**Mihono:** Yeah\!  
**Akira:** Alright, here, hop on back\.  
**Mihono:** Awesome\!  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.Huh, so this is how it feels to be up on a bike\.  
**Akira:**　Well, yeah\. When you've had enough, get off\.  
**Mihono:** Ehhh\!\? You're not gonna let me ride anywhere with you\!\?  
**Akira:** It's not like I don't want you to, but we can't do it like this\.  
**Mihono:** Is it because\.\.\. You don't have an extra helmet\?  
**Akira:** More like, it's against the law\. You can't ride with a passenger until a year after you've gotten your license\.  
**Mihono:** There's a law like that, huh\.\.\.  
**Akira:** It's the kind of thing you wouldn't know about unless you had a license yourself\.  
**Akira:** So, sorry 'bout this, Mihono\.  
**Mihono:** You pay attention to this stuff, huh, Akira-san\.  
**Akira:** Huh\? What're you talking about; 'course I do\.  
**Akira:** Anyway, that's how it is, so it's not gonna happen today\. Give it a few more months and I'll take you for a ride\.  
**Mihono:** You mean it\!\? It's a promise\!  
**Akira:** Deal\.  
**Mihono:** Get a helmet ready for me too, okay\!  
**Akira:** Who do you think you're talkin' to\? I bought one of those back when I got my license\!  
**Mihono:** Oh, you did\? Was it because there was somebody you wanted to ride with you\?  
**Akira:** Just a buddy of mine\.  
**Akira:** I thought maybe I'd show them how cool bikes were, and they'd get their own license\.  
**Akira:** You're gonna try and get your license, right Mihono\?  
**Mihono:** I'm interested in trying\!  
**Akira:** Bring it on\!  
**Akira:** Bikes are the best\! After you get your license, we'll go somewhere together\!  
**Mihono:** Okay\!  
**Mihono:** But, it's going to be a while before I can get my license, so before then, please let me ride on the back of your bike\!  
**Akira:** 'Course\! It's a promise\! Don't you forget it\!

## [Dress 20 - Akira: Start\]: No Way I'd Be Late
**Yomi:** Akira\.  
**Akira:** Nn\? Ahh, there you are, Yomi\. It's not often you're the one calling me up\.  
**Yomi:** Yukari-sama will be hosting a recognition party for the Miss Five Traditions event\.  
**Yomi:** Please be there, Akira\.  
**Akira:** Sure, I got it\.  
**Yomi:** And please try not to be late this time either\.  
**Akira:** Oi oi, I might show up late a lot, but that doesn't mean I'm gonna be late all the time, alright\?  
**Yomi:** \.\.\.I hope I can hold you to that\. I've made sure to let you know\.  
The day of the party\.

  
**Akira:** Why'd I have to get a suppression mission today of all days\!\?  
**Fukuda Sawano:** The aradama are on the move, Inago-san\!  
**Akira:** ORAA\!  
**Aradama:** UOOOO\.\.\.  
**Sawano:** If nothing else, you at least know how to handle yourself, Inago-san\.  
**Akira:** Huh\? What's that supposed to mean\?  
**Sawano:** No, nothing at all\.  
**Sawano:** At any rate, I'm glad you're here\. Who'd have thought\.\.\.  
**Sawano:** Such a large aradama outbreak would happen\.  
**Akira:** Tch\. And just when I was thinking I'd made it to school on time for once\!  
**Akira:** Oi, you mind if I just do my own thing here\? I've got somewhere to be after this\!  
**Sawano:** Ordinarily I'd say we can't manage, but\.\.\. Fine\. We'll do what we can to support you\.  
**Akira:** Sorry\. I'll pay you back for this soon enough\.  
**Sawano:** Please deal with the aradama\. That would be plenty\.  
**Akira:** Count on me\!  
**Akira:** That's finally over with\!  
**Akira:** But, look how late it got\.\.\. There's no way I'm making it on time\.  
**Akira:** What's Yomi gonna say\.\.\.  
**Sawano:** Thank you very much for today, Inago-san\.  
**Sawano:** Especially for helping us on the day of the Miss Five Traditions recognition party\.  
**Akira:** There's no getting out of it when it's my mission\. Seeya around, Sawano\.  
**Sawano:** Ah\.  
**Sawano:** Inago-san\.\.\. So she remembered my name\.  

## [Dress 20 - Akira: End\]: Grape Juice
**Akira:** Phew, made it\.  
**Yomi:** As late as usual\.  
**Akira:** Geh, Yomi\!\?  
**Yomi:** Even after I made such a point of warning you, you still couldn't be here on time\.  
**Akira:** What was I supposed to do\! I mean, I went to school like normal too\!  
**Akira:** But then I got sent on this mission all of a sudden, and up till now I was way out in the mountains suppressing aradama\!  
**Yomi:** That sounds like something you would do\. Don't you think you could have refused, just for today\?  
**Akira:** Huh\? Between a mission and a party, 'course I'd deal with the mission first\. What're you talking about\?  
**Yomi:** \.\.\.That is very like you\.  
**Yomi:** There's a dress ready for you\. Please come inside\.  
**Akira:** Alright, and sorry 'bout this\.  
**Sana:** Well look at that, now there's someone I don't see too often\.  
**Akira:** It's been a while, huh, President Sana\.  
**Akira:** \.\.\.Ah\.  
**Sana:** What is it\?  
**Akira:** Your glass's empty, right\? I'll fill it up for you\.  
**Sana:** That's not alcohol you're holding there, is it\?  
**Akira:** What, this\? It's grape juice\. See\?  
**Sana:** \.\.\.\.\.\.You're right, that's definitely grape juice\.  
**Akira:** I am still a minor and all\. This grape juice's pretty good too\.  
**Sana:** I think I heard we got it in from a winery\.  
**Akira:** No wonder it's good then\.  
**Sana:** Inago, how have things been on your end lately\?  
**Akira:** On what end\?  
**Sana:** You haven't been showing your face around Mokusa, have you\?  
**Akira:** Things've been a little busy in our faction since the leader changed\.  
**Sana:** \.\.\.Her, hm\.  
**Akira:** Yeah\. \.\.\.I've gotta do what I can to back her up\.  
**Sana:** \.\.\.I see\. Don't get in over your head at least\.  
**Akira:** Not much I can do about that\. What kinda friend wouldn't go to crazy lengths for them\?  
**Sana:** If I were talking to Kaoru, she'd be glad hearing me say to slack off\. But I guess this is your answer\.  
**Sana:** Well, enjoy yourself today\.  
**Akira:** Yeah\. I'll take you up on that\.

## [Pirate - Akira: Start\]:  We Can Enjoy the Perks Sometimes, Right\?
**Aradama:** GGGGGII\.\.\.\!  
**Mihono:** Akira-san\! Now's your chance\!  
**Akira:** Sure, leave it to me\!  
**Akira:** You're not gettin' away, ORAAAAAHH\!  
**Mihono:** Nice\!  
**Yomi:** Asakura-san\. There still seem to be aradama in the area we're in charge of\. Approaching from 9 o'clock; be on guard\.  
**Mihono:** 9 o'clock\? Wait, which way is that\!\?  
**Akira:** Left from where you're facing, Mihono\!  
**Akira:** Yomi, are those the last of 'em\?  
**Yomi:** Yes\.  
**Akira:** Cool, let's finish this quick\.  
**Park Manager:** Thank you very much\. Now we can re-open for business\.  
**Park Manager:** As a way to give our thanks, once the others are finished clearing out the aradama, would you like to enjoy our newest attraction\?  
**Park Manager:** It's based around a theme of pirates and treasure hunting; \"Treasures of the Pirates\"\.  
**Park Manager:** And there were nine toji who came here today\. You can make three teams of three, so it works out perfectly\.  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.\!\!  
**Akira:** Nah, we're good\. That's a real nice offer, but we've got work to get back to\.  
**Mihono:** Akira-san\.\.\.  
**Akira:** \.\.\.Or I was thinking, but, if you're gonna extend the favor, we should have some fun after all\!  
**Mihono:** If we're in teams of three, we can just stay in the teams we're in, so we can play as soon as the mission's over\!  
**Park Manager:** Then, I'll arrange for that\. We would appreciate it if you would give us your impressions once you're done as well\.  
**Akira:** That's a small price to pay\. Thanks for having us\!  
**Mihono:** I'll go let everybody know\! And help them out too\!  
**Akira:** Were you okay with this\? You're probably busy\.  
**Yomi:** I don't mind\. I can stay with you for today\.  
**Akira:** You sure\? Sorry\. Though, if we're doin' it, we might as well have fun\.  
**Akira:** You're lookin' pretty good as pirates\! The three of us'll get that hidden treasure for sure\!  
**Mihono:** Aye aye sir\! We have to go to the beach on the map straight away\!  
**Akira:** Nah, first we're stealing the maps offa Yui and Suu\! Loot and plunder\! Cause we're pirates right now\!  
**Mihono:** Oh, yeah\! The rules said we can do that too, didn't they\.  
**Yomi:** It seems only one team has the correct map to begin with\.  
**Yomi:** If we board the other ships and lower their pirate flag, they have to give up their treasure map\.  
**Akira:** If we get all the maps, our odds of finding the treasure go up\. And it sounds more fun than just going around looking, right\?  
**Mihono:** Yeah\! It's totally more exciting\!  
**Yomi:** There is a time limit, so please don't forget that, you two\.  

## [Pirate - Akira: End\]: Alriiight, We're Boarding\!
**Akira:** Yo, wanna have a little fun with us\?  
**Akira:** Give us a minute and we'll get your flag down\.  
**Yomi:** That's how this will be, so excuse us\.  
**Akira:** You gotta get more aggressive at times like these\.  
**Yomi:** \.\.\.That's not how I am\.  
**Ellen:** We were planning on picking a fight ourselves, but we were beaten to the punch\.  
**Kiyoka:** That's mostly Captain Yui's fault though\!  
**Kiyoka:** And also, where's Hono-chan\.\.\.\?  
**Akira:** You can tell by looking, so I'll say she's off on her own here\.  
**Ellen:** Is she protecting your flag\? Or, is she sneaking over to ours\. --One of those two, right\?  
**Kiyoka:** Since it's Hono-chan\.\.\. She wouldn't sit still and watch the flag\. So it might be down to the captain\.  
**Ellen:** I was thinking the same thing\. Let's take out Inagon and Yomiyomi and get their flag, Kiyoka\!  
**Kiyoka:** Alright\!  
**Akira:** I'm all for a fight\! Let's do this, Yomi\!  
**Yomi:** Right\.  
**Mihono:** Aww\.\.\. So Fukki's ship won in the end\?  
**Kofuki:** Well, on accident\.  
**Mihono:** But still-, that means there was no point in how hard we worked getting Yui's map, so it's twice as frustrating\!  
**Akira:** Yeah, guess not\.  
**Akira:** But y'know, it was pretty damn fun swinging around toy swords instead of our okatana for once, right\?  
**Mihono:** Yeah-- it was like I was back to playing around as a kid again\!  
**Ellen:** I get the feeling Kaoru would have fun playing this\. Maybe I should invite her, when we get a day off\.  
**Yomi:** Tsubakuro-san would as well\. After I tell her about today, she might be eager to come here\.  
**Akira:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Yomi:** What is it\?  
**Akira:** Nah, nothing\. You'd wanna spend fun times with your buddies, wouldn't you\.  
**Yomi:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Yui:** Mannn, seeing Boss tearing around like a real pirate was so good\!  
**Akira:**　Thanks, Yui\. \.\.\.Might as well ask, that's a compliment, right\?  
**Yui:** That goes without saying\! I've got nothing but good things and more good things to say about girls\!  
**Akira:** S-Sure\. So, where was the treasure at anyway\?  
**Hiyori:** You'd better ask her about that\.  
**Suu:** Eep\.\.\. A-Ask m-me\?  
**Akira:** Huh\.\.\. Why'd she suddenly get all weird\?  
**Yomi:** Isn't that\.\.\. because she's scared of the way you look like a bad person, Akira\?  
**Akira:** It's not like I did anything to her\.\.\. And anyway, that's pretty blunt of you\. Kinda hurt\.  
**Suu:** I-I'm sorry\.\.\. Then, if you'll let me, I'll go over in detail how we found the treasure, to\.\.\. to the best of my ability\!\!  
**Akira:** You don't gotta apologize\.  
**Suu:** I'm sorry\.\.\. Ah, ah, I'm sorry\.\.\.\! Then, I'll begin now, if that's okay\.\.\.\!  
**Akira:** Sure\.\.\. Whenever you're ready\. Just take it easy\.  
**Akira:** (\.\.\.Is it my highlights that're no good\? The jacket\? What's the problem\.\.\. How I talk\?\)  
**Akira:** (But I don't wanna change any of it\.\.\.\) 

## [Misogi - Akira: Start\]: New Recruit
**Makoto:** I have something I'd like you to be in charge of, Akira-chan\. Please join this toji on an aradama suppression mission\.  
**Akira:** Fine by me, but, who's this chick\? Don't think she's with us, is she\?  
**Makoto:** President Maniwa introduced her to me the other day\.  
**Makoto:** Her name is\.\.\. Nitta Hirona\. Her okatana is the Mizuguchi Rapier\.  
**Makoto:** She's another victim of Origami Yukari\.  
**Akira:** \.\.\.Hmm\. You're asking me to go cause you want me to test her\?  
**Akira:** Think there's something sketchy with her\?  
**Makoto:** I did an investigation, though nothing came up\.  
**Makoto:** But\.\.\. I want to know, as a person, can we put our faith in her\. That's why I want you there\.  
**Akira:** \.\.\.That's a big job\. Just leave her to me, Makocchan\.  
**Akira:** (That's what I told her, but\.\.\.\)  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Akira:** (Ever since we met up, she's just been standing around staring at nothing\. Is she\.\.\. actually gonna be able to handle her own with aradama\?\)  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\? Is something wrong\?  
**Akira:** You sure you're up for this\? Think you'll be able to take out some aradama\?  
**Hirona:** I'll be fiine\.  
**Hirona:** Though, strangely, I do get told a lot I should consider changing departments\.  
**Akira:** Probably cause you getting hurt on their watch'd give them trouble sleeping at night\.  
**Hirona:** Are you sure\? Every unit I was assigned to always had their results improved though\?  
**Akira:** Did they really\? You sure they weren't fudging the numbers\?  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.Fudging\?  
**Akira:** I'm asking if you're just making shit up\!  
**Akira:** (Seriously, for somebody who keeps blanking out, she's weirdly in your face\.\)  
**Akira:** (But whatever, it's good she's not spooked by me\. Yeah, seems like she's got guts\.\)  
**Hirona:** I confirmed where the aradama are\.  
**Akira:** \.\.\.What do you wanna do\?  
**Hirona:** A surprise attack would be efficient\.  
**Akira:** (Didn't even hesitate\.\.\. That's good\.\)  
**Akira:** Cool, let's go with that then\.  
**Hirona:** Okaaay\.  
**Akira:** (Alright, now show me how you handle yourself\.\)  

## [Misogi - Akira: End\]: Nitta Hirona
**Hirona:** YAH\!  
**Aradama:** oooo\.\.\.  
**Akira:** That Mizuguchi Rapier\.\.\. You sure can fight with that thing\.  
**Hirona:** Everyone says that\. So\.\.\. the next one\!  
**Akira:** (She's not bad\.\.\. maybe better than Yuuki\?\)  
**Akira:** (Well, it's enough if she can do that much\. Yuuki could use a practice partner\.\)  
**Akira:** (Though I'd love it if she were just a bit more capable\. But now's not really the time to be getting picky\.\)  
**Aradama:** GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\!  
**Akira:** --\!\?  
**Akira:** This one's\.\.\. Oi\! You can back off\! I'll take this one myself\!  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.Inago-san, do you watch sports\?  
**Akira:** The hell are you going on about now\!\?  
**Hirona:** In baseball, they don't throw with the same strength at the top of the batting order as they do at the bottom\. In soccer, they don't run at full sprint the whole time\.  
**Hirona:** I think they play keeping the effort required in mind\.  
**Akira:** Oi\!\! Would you listen to me already--  
**Hirona:**　And I think that can work for toji too\. Regulating effort depending on the opponent\.  
**Hirona:** With all that in mind, if they're strong, I'll put in everything\.\.\.\!\!  
**Aradama:** GUOHhh\.\.\.  
**Akira:** Wha\!\? How the hell'd you move like that\!\? Were you holding that back this whole time\!\?  
**Hirona:** You can call it regulating effort\. I was just weighing the cost and benefits\.  
**Hirona:** Though\.\.\. It does sound slightly cool the way you said it\.  
**Akira:** Hah-\! You're pretty damn funny\!  
**Hirona:** Does this mean I passed your test\?  
**Akira:** \.\.\.What makes you think that\?  
**Hirona:** Someone as skilled as you paired with a beginner like me\. And also, the aradama we were assigned to defeat weren't strong enough to need someone like you here, Inago-san\.  
**Hirona:** Which means there's some other reason for it, isn't there\? Otherwise there's no benefit to you being here\.  
**Akira:** (She figured it all out, and that attitude\.\.\. Pretty good\! I'm starting to like her\!\)  
**Akira:** Yeah, you passed\. No complaints from me\. We'd be glad to have ya, Hirona\!  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.Please take care of mee\.
