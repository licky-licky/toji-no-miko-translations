## 1: Something I Won't Bend On
**Akira:** We were looking for you, Mihono. Though I figured you'd be wandering around closer to the mansion...  
**Butterfly Shaped Aradama:** ...  
**Akira:** So that's why. You'd make it this far if Yomi's leading you around.  
**Akira:** We don't want to get rough with you if we don't have to. Come with us, Mihono.  
**Yuuki:** Please, Mihono-san.  
**Yuuki:** If you won't... Akira-nee-sama and I will bring you with us, even if we need to cut you down.  
**Mihono:** I'm on your side with trying to reduce the amount of toji getting hurt... But, I'm sure what you and Hitakami-san are doing is wrong\!  
**Yuuki:** I know that Makoto-nee-sama isn't wrong. I want you to believe in her too.  
**Akira:** ...Either way, you already know what's going on. You can't go back anymore.  
**Mihono:** I'll... trust in the investigation team.  
**Akira:** Sure you would.  
**Akira:** The investigation team wouldn't abandon you either. They'd give everything trying to do something about Kanayamahime.  
**Akira:** But, that's as far as they'd get. You can't stop Kanayamahime from awakening. Makkochan's probably the only one who can, alright?  
**Mihono:** Then...  
**Akira:** I won't tell you you've gotta work with us forever. I won't make you join our faction either.  
**Akira:** Just, stay until we can settle this thing with Kanayamahime.  
**Mihono:** ...And in return, I have to help with your experiments, right?  
**Akira:** That's right.  
**Akira:** Y'know, I think pretty highly of you. I've been watching you a long time, under Makocchan's orders.  
**Mihono:** Huh?  
**Akira:** You didn't know, didja?  
**Akira:** The first time we met was at that shopping mall, but I'd known all about you before then. I'd heard about you from your buddies too.  
**Akira:** So what I'm saying is, I know just what kinda girl you are. And honestly, in the back of my mind... I knew you were never gonna work with us.  
**Mihono:** If you knew I wouldn't go along with you, then... why bother with this?  
**Akira:** I told ya, didn't I? I took a liking to you. That's why, just give in on this just this once. We won't do anything bad.  
**Akira:** Makocchan and us'll do everything we can. We'll figure something out with Kanayamahime, and we'll make sure there's no more failures with tamayori\!  
**Akira:** So come on, Mihono... Just help out Makocchan.  
**Mihono:** ......  
**Mihono:** I'm sorry.  
**Akira:** ...So that's it.  
**Akira:** For Makocchan... I'd do whatever it takes.  
**Akira:** Yuuki\! We're bringing Mihono back with us\! Don't go easy on her\!\!  
**Yuuki:** Right\! I feel the same as you do, Akira-nee-sama\!  
**Akira:** Last time we went up against each other was back in that shopping mall.  
**Mihono:** ...Don't think I'm the same as I was back then.  
**Akira:** You are. If you're not using Kanayamahime, you're not gonna beat me.  
**Mihono:** I'll use her... It scares me, and I really don't want to, but...  
**Mihono:** If it'll get me back to see everybody again...\!\!  

## 2: Hitakami's Experiments
At the same time.

  
**???:** Ah, aghh, ah, aghhh...  
**Kiyoka:** What... is that...?ã€€  
**Mirja:** There's an aradama wrapped over her body... No; or has her body itself turned into aradama...?  
**Yui:** When they said the Hitakami faction was doing experiments, is this what they made...?  
**Hitakami Toji L:** That's... one of the failed tamayori subjects...?  
**Hitakami Toji H:** Who went and brought one out here...?  
**Kofuki:** Oi oi, even the enemy's backing off. Isn't that thing with them?  
**Chie:** Makoto... Just what are you doing...?  
**???:** Haghh, hghh...  
**Hitakami Toji L:** Kh, we might not be able to control her, but we can still use this\! We'll beat down the intruders with her\!  
**???:** RRRRGGHHHHHHHH\!\!\!  
**Everyone:** \!\!  
**Kiyoka:** Did she just use hachimanriki...?  
**Mirja:** It didn't look as though she did.  
**Mirja:** Though... to have that much power without hachimanriki... That's clearly not something a human could do...  
**Yui:** I wouldn't want to fight with that either.  
**Kiyoka:** B-But, can her body even take it...  
**???:** ...et, not yet...  
**Kofuki:** Seems fine to me.  
**Mirja:** This is troubling... How should we respond to this... Setouchi Chie?  
**Chie:** ...We know much too little about what we're up against, so I'd like to avoid combat as much as possible, but...  
**???:** HAAAAAAAHHHH\!\!  
**Yui:** UWAH\!\?  
**Kofuki:** Oi\! It's not like we've got all the time in the world here\!  
**Kiyoka:** Chie-san\!  
**Chie:** We're counterattacking\! Mirja, give us combat orders\!\!  
**Mirja:** Understood.  
**Mirja:** Our only threat here is that enemy. Eliminate the other toji first and focus all your efforts on that one\!  
**Mirja:** Don't take her attacks head on\! Utilize the openings after each attack\!  
**Mirja:** Here she comes\!  

## 3: Unexpected Help
**???:** Ugh, urghh...  
**Kiyoka:** She still won't go down...?  
**Yui:** I get the feeling I've seen this scene in zombie movies before...  
**Mirja:** If you can speak that casually about it, you must be taking this stride.  
**Yui:** It's not like that... It's more like, if I don't joke about it, fighting a toji in this state is too sad...  
**Chie:** That's for sure...  
**???:** You're right; this is as ugly as it gets.  
**Yui:** That voice\!\?  
**Yume:** What're you onee-sans doing here?  
**Mirja:** The special defense team?  
**Mirja:** You aren't here acting on Asakura Mihono's case... are you?  
**Maki:** That's right. We're here on our own circumstances.  
**Maki:** But that doesn't mean we're cold enough to ignore your situation. Yomi.  
**Yomi:** Right.  
**Yomi:** Please follow after these aradama. They will lead you to Asakura-san.  
**Maki:** Go. You can leave things here to us.  
**Yume:** More like, you're getting in our way\!  
**Yume:** Maki-onee-san and me can handle that thing easy.  
**Chie:** ......Mirja.  
**Mirja:** ...Understood. We'll leave you to it.  
**Maki:** Good, that's a smart call. Get going\!  
**Yume:** All that's left is to bring down that onee-san, huh.  
**Maki:** Even looking like that, we're still up against a toji. Are you alright with that, Yume?  
**Yume:** I know already. I won't overdo it like back when I fought against Mokusa.  
**Maki:** That's good then.  
**Maki:** Now, let's bring her under control\!  

## 4: Welcome and I'm Back
**Mirja:** The direction Satsuki Yomi's aradama are moving in... It's the opposite direction of the mansion.  
**Yui:** So Mihono-chan's this far out in these hills. Without them leading us, we might not have met up with her.  
**Kiyoka:** Hono-chan is probably running away, isn't she... Which means... wouldn't she be in a pretty bad situation?  
**Mirja:** There's no mistaking that she must have fought against the Hitakami faction.  
**Mirja:** We have no way of knowing what happened or the result, but... her current circumstances can't be good.  
**Kofuki:** She could've also just gotten lost out here. And it wouldn't be weird if her phone just wasn't getting a signal out here.  
**Mirja:** That would be the most harmonious outcome. Though... In that case, I can't understand the reason for the Hitakami faction being on such high alert.  
**Kofuki:** I guess so. What a pain in the ass-.  
**Chie:** Mihono-chan...  
**Chie:** ...Let's hurry\! We should reach her as soon as we can.  
**Mihono:** Huh? The aradama stopped moving...? Does that mean I should just wait here?  
**Mihono:** More of these aradama...?  
**Chie:** Mihono-chan\!  
**Mihono:** ......Eh?  
**Chie:** Thank goodness, you're safe\! Look how dirty you are... Are you hurt anywhere?  
**Mihono:** Chii-nee... And, everybody else... Am I dreaming?  
**Mihono:** Why would all of you be out here in the mountains...  
**Kofuki:** C'mon, we didn't hike through all this just for this to be a dream.  
**Kofuki:** Though, it figures you'd say something like that, Mihocchi.  
**Yui:** Mm\! That's Mihono-chan, no doubt about it\!  
**Kiyoka:** You're not dreaming...\! We came to get you, Hono-chan\!  
**Mihono:** You really did...?  
**Mihono:** Guys...\!  
**Kofuki:** O-Oi\!\? What're you crying out of nowhere for\!\!  
**Mihono:** Of course I'm gonna cry...\!  
**Mihono:** Cause, I was all alone up in the mountains in Tohoku, and Hitakami-san's toji were chasing after me, and I couldn't use Kashuu Kiyomitsu's power...  
**Yui:** You worked really hard, Mihono-chan\! Come and dive right into my chest\!  
**Mihono:** Yui\~\!  
**Kofuki:** The two of them've lost it. Right, Kiyoka?  
**Kiyoka:** Hono-chan... I'm so glaaad...  
**Kofuki:** Now you're crying too\!\?  
**Kiyoka:** Of course I'd be crying...  
**Mirja:** ...Asakura Mihono. I'm glad to see you're safe.  
**Mihono:** Mirja-san...  
**Chie:** I'm so sorry, Mihono-chan. I... I had no idea what Makoto was getting into now...  
**Mihono:** That's not it\! That's now how this should go, Chii-nee\!  
**Mihono:** This is... It's my fault for not listening properly to what you and Mirja-san were telling me.  
**Mirja:** Asakura Mihono...  
**Mihono:** I just let it get to my head. Since that power made me stronger... I'm sorry, Chii-nee, Mirja-san.  
**Mirja:** You aren't the only one at fault. When this was troubling you, Setouchi Chie and I should have stayed closer at your side.  
**Chie:** Mirja and I thought, if we could just do something about Kashuu Kiyomitsu... But you were worrying about this the whole time, Mihono-chan...  
**Mihono:** Kashuu Kiyomitsu's... No. Hitakami-san told me about what's really causing this power...  
**Mihono:** My strength... It wasn't coming from Kashuu Kiyomitsu after all.  
**Mihono:** I'm...  
**Mirja:** Please tell us everything after we've returned. For now... Welcome back, Asakura Mihono.  
**Mihono:** ...\!  
**Kofuki:** Wait, isn't it weird telling her welcome back when we're the ones who came out to get her?  
**Mirja:** Is it really?  
**Kiyoka:** I feel like it's alright to tell her welcome back.  
**Yui:** Then, I'm on Kofuki-san's side here\! We're enemies this time, Kiyoka-chan\!  
**Kofuki:** I mean, who cares either way? It just crossed my mind.  
**Yui:** She betrayed me\~\!  
**Chie:** Okay, that's enough fooling around now.  
**Chie:** It's too soon for us to relax yet.  
**Mihono:** ...  
**Chie:** What's wrong, Mihono-chan?  
**Mihono:** ...It just feels like, I'm really back.  
**Mihono:** I'm back, everybody\!  

## 5: Tamayori (1)
**Maki:** HAAAAH\!\!  
**Yume:** Alright, now you're done\!  
**???:** Grgh...\!  
**Yume:** I'll give you that you're a little tough and got some power, but that's it. You're no big deal.  
**???:** Ugh, urgh......\!  
**Yume:** Ah, she ran off\! Stop\!  
**Akira:** You're the ones who should stop. Trampling over somebody's yard and all.  
**Maki:** Inago Akira and Toribane Yuuki?  
**Akira:** The elite guard... Or wait, you're the special defense team now? Well, it's all the same.  
**Yomi:** ...Akira.  
**Akira:** Hm? Hey, it's been a while, Yomi. Seems like you've been through a lot, but I'm glad you're looking alright.  
**Yomi:** How is Hitakami-san doing?  
**Akira:** She's just fine. Wanna see her?  
**Yomi:** ...No.  
**Yuuki:** Akira-nee-sama, please don't make small talk with the enemy. Especially not in front of... Tsubakuro Yume.  
**Yume:** Have we met somewhere before? Since I don't remember you, I'm pretty sure that means you're weak.  
**Yuuki:** This is our first time meeting. However... I know about you. What you did to everyone at Mokusa.  
**Yume:** ......  
**Akira:** ...Yuuki. The way you are now, you're not beating Tsubakuro Yume.  
**Yuuki:** With all due respect, Nee-sama. Do you only pick fights that you know you'll win?  
**Akira:** ...  
**Yuuki:** You don't, do you?  
**Akira:** Haha\! You got me there\! I don't mind that attitude one bit, Yuuki\!  
**Yuuki:** I've been watching your back, Nee-sama. So, even if we won't win... We'll give them a fight\!  
**Yume:** Fine by me, I'll take you on\!  

## 6: Tamayori (2)
**Yume:** And, there.  
**Yuuki:** Rgh\!  
**Yume:** That's my win, uh... Who were you again?  
**Yuuki:** I'm... Toribane Yuuki.  
**Yume:** I'll take you anytime, so whenever you think you can beat me, bring it on, Onee-san.  
**Maki:** That leaves only you left.  
**Akira:** Tch... You guys really are tough as hell.  
**Maki:** Inago Akira. Put a stop to your research.  
**Maki:** The Sword Administration Bureau can't turn a blind eye to what you're doing.  
**Akira:** Hah, what a joke. You're gonna play innocent to the shit you did and talk down to us?  
**Maki:** As someone who made their own share of mistakes... I'm warning you not to make them too.  
**Akira:** ...Tch. Oi, Yomi. You're not gonna lecture me like Shidou Maki here, are ya?  
**Yomi:** I am also a member of the special defense team.  
**Akira:** ...That so. Well, what can you do. We've both got our own positions. And what we think matters most ain't the same.  
**Akira:** --Yuuki, we're pulling out\!  
**Yuuki:** Right\!  
**Maki:** Kgh...\!  
**Maki:** They ran away...  
**Yomi:** Will we give chase?  
**Maki:** ...No, we should hold off. This is the Hitakami's territory. Pushing in too deep could bring on too much danger.  
**Yume:** I'd already pretty much figured out how strong those two are too. Well, whatever.  
**Maki:** At any rate, we should return and report to Yukari-sama and Akane-sama. The Hitakamis seem to be doing something even riskier than we thought...  

## 7: For My Desire
**Akira:** Sorry, Makocchan. Mihono gave us the slip...  
**Yuuki:** I wasn't able to be any use either...  
**Makoto:** No, I'm the one who should be apologizing. I've pressed the both of you into an unpleasant role...  
**Makoto:** Akira-chan and Yuuki-chan, the two of you have both taken an interest in Asakura-san, haven't you?  
**Makoto:** In spite of that, I had forced you to fight against her...  
**Akira:** Don't think that you forced me to do it. That was my own choice doing that.  
**Yuuki:** The same goes for me. There's no need for you to feel bothered by it, Makoto-nee-sama.  
**Makoto:** Thank you very much, the both of you... I always find myself depending on your support.  
**Makoto:** Even though, by all rights, as the head of the Hitakami family, I should be much more reliable...  
**Akira:** Y'know, Makocchan. It's not like the reason I'm helping you's got anything to do with you being the head of the Hitakami family.  
**Akira:** I'm just helping you cause you're Makocchan. The same Makocchan I've known since we were kids; cause we're best buds.  
**Akira:** And when your best buds are in trouble, you do everything you can to get 'em out. That's just the way it is.  
**Yuuki:** That's exactly right\! I'll help you too, Makoto-nee-sama\!  
**Makoto:** Akira-chan... Yuuki-chan...  
**Akira:** You'd do the same too, right? If Yuuki or me were in trouble, you'd do whatever you can for us, wouldn't you?  
**Makoto:** Yes. Of course I would.  
**Akira:** So we're the same.  
**Akira:** Ever since we were little, no matter what the three of us did, we pulled through it together. So this time too, all I'm doing is trying to help a buddy of mine out.  
**Yuuki:** Please use me however you see fit, Makoto-nee-sama. The three of us work together as one.  
**Makoto:** Fufu. That's right, isn't it. I'll continue to be in your care, you two.  
**Akira:** Anyway\! Let's put an end to the pity party here.  
**Akira:** While we were chasing after Mihono, we came across another failed tamayori toji. We managed to catch and put her under safety.  
**Makoto:** You did...? Thank you very much.  
**Yuuki:** Those old Hitakami bosses... Next time, let's light a fire under their asses\!  
**Akira:** Hey... Where'd you learn to talk like that?  
**Yuuki:** From you, Akira-nee-sama.  
**Makoto:** Fufu. Bit by bit, Yuuki-chan might be coming to speak more like you, Akira-chan.  
**Akira:** Seriously...? Oi, Yuuki. You don't gotta go out of your way to copy me.  
**Yuuki:** It's not that I was trying to copy you... It just happened to slip out.  
**Akira:** Sigh\~... Well, it's fine.  
**Akira:** More importantly, how many failed tamayori toji are we at now...?  
**Akira:** The ones up top are working out their alibis and hiding who's doing it, so we can't even pin down who's to blame.  
**Makoto:** We can't have the girls who were experimented on remain in that state forever. We'll have to cure them, no matter what.  
**Akira:** And, to cure them, we're gonna still have to improve on what we can do with tamayori.  
**Makoto:** We cannot put it off any longer. If we could only create one successful case of a tamayori toji, we could gather enough data from it...  
**Makoto:** Now that we can no longer hope for Asakura-san's assistance, I will use myself as a tamayori test subject.  
**Akira:** Wha--\!\?  
**Yuuki:** Y-You'll use yourself, Makoto-nee-sama\!\?  
**Makoto:** If you trace it back, the Atago and Hitakami come from the same bloodline. Though not nearly as much as Asakura-san, I am still suitable for tamayori.  
**Akira:** But still, there's a good chance it's gonna fail, isn't there\!\?  
**Makoto:** Yes. I understand that, of course.  
**Makoto:** But, if we continue to sit idly by, we won't be able to save those toji who were victims of the experimenting.  
**Makoto:** There are times that risks must be taken to achieve success. And there is no greater time for that than now.  
**Other:** Tamayori Toji  
**Suzuka:** Akane-sama, Yukari-sama. A report came in from Yomi-san.  
**Akane:** Please, go on.  
**Suzuka:** The Hitakami faction are attempting to create "tamayori toji."  
**Suzuka:** It appears to be research into improving a toji's abilities by equipping noro onto the body.  
**Akane:** Equipping noro onto the body...  
**Suzuka:** They've already begun human experimentation, and it seems they entered combat with one of the experiment results.  
**Yukari:** ...I see.  
**Akane:** What about Asakura-san?  
**Suzuka:** She safely escaped, from the sound of things.  
**Akane:** That's good to hear...  
**Akane:** Nee-sama, why do you think Hitakami-san found it necessary to bring in Asakura-san? Is there some connection between her and these tamayori toji...?  
**Yukari:** We should hear that from Asakura herself. Prepare to be ready to act against whatever those details may be.  
**Akane:** ...Right.
