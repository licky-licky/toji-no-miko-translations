## 1: To Where You Need to Return (1\)
**Minato:** So, you're Hiyori-chan\?  
**Hiyori:** I am\.  
**Minato:** You're just like what I heard\.  
**Hiyori:** What were you telling her, Kanami\?  
**Kanami:** N-Nothing special\.  
**Minato:** Fufu, you're totally like Kagari\.  
**Kagari:** Kanami-san resembles you as well, Minato-senpai\.  
**Minato:** Ehh\~, we're nothing alike\. Kanami's the cute type, while I'm the sexy type\.  
**Kanami:** Are you actually the sexy type\.\.\.\?  
**Minato:** What else am I then\!\?  
**Kagari:** The ill-mannered type\.  
**Minato:** KAGARIII\! Geez, you haven't changed at all\!  
**Minato:** But anyway, both of us managed to have such cute daughters, huh\. Isn't that great\? \.\.\.Kagari\.  
**Kagari:** It is\.  
**Minato:** Go on, Kagari\. Call her by her name\.  
**Kagari:** Alright\.  
**Kagari:** \.\.\.Hiyori\.\.\.san\.  
**Minato:** She's your daughter\! You don't need the \"san\"\.  
**Kagari:** \.\.\.H-Hiyori\.  
**Hiyori:** Ahh\.\.\.  
**Minato:** Alright, you too, Hiyori-chan\. Call her \"Mom\.\"  
**Kanami:** Ehh-, but you always hate it when I call you that\~\.  
**Minato:** It's fine right now\!  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.\.\.\.Mom\.\.\.  
**Kagari:** Hiyori\.  
**Hiyori:** What's that\?  
**Kagari:** Perhaps this small gap drifting in the netherworld is being swallowed into its depths\.  
**Kanami:** Mother, I'm glad I got to be with you at the end\.  
**Minato:** What're you talking about\? You two are going home\.  
**Kanami:** Huh\? Wait, how are we supposed to go home\?  
**Minato:** How\.\.\. Well, I don't know that much\.  
**Kanami:** Ehhh\~\~\~\!\?  
**Hiyori:** I thought anyone who went to the depths of the netherworld wouldn't be able to return\?  
**Minato:** And who said that\?  
**Kagari:** There's no precedent for anyone ever returning\.  
**Minato:** Really\?  
**Kagari:** Though, since you two still have your bodies, you might be able to\.  
**Kagari:** In order to do that--  
**Minato:** We're gonna have to do this after all\!  
**Kanami:** Why did it come to this anyway\?  
**Kagari:** It's best to break off any lingering attachments you have left\. They might prevent you from returning\.  
**Kanami:** Lingering attachments\.\.\.\?  
**Minato:** You say that, but Kanami just wanted to fight me so bad she couldn't sit still, am I right\?  
**Kanami:** Ehehe, so you could tell after all\.  
**Minato:** A mother can tell it all\.  
**Kanami:** Here I come\!  
**Minato:** Bring it on\!  
**Kanami:** You really are tough\.\.\. I can't even come close to winning\.  
**Minato:** Nn\? You sure you're fine admitting that\? \.\.\.You won't make it back like that\!  
**Kanami:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.I'm going back to see everyone\. Together with Hiyori-chan\!  
**Minato:** That's more like it\!  
**Kanami:** HAAAAA-\!\!  

## 2: To Where You Need to Return (2\)
**Kagari:** Should we spar as well\?  
**Hiyori:** No, I don't\.\.\.  
**Kagari:** Fufu\.\.\. We might be alike in that regard\.  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.There is one thing, that I want to ask you\.  
**Kagari:** What is it\?  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.Do you regret anything\?  
**Kagari:** Hiyori\. Are you happy now\?  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.I am\. Because, when it was difficult, I had someone special to help carry my burden\.\.\. I have all these friends\.  
**Kagari:** I see\.\.\. Then, I don't regret anything\.  
**Hiyori:** Alright\!  
**Minato:** Oww\.\.\. I went and lost\.\.\.  
**Kagari:** Even Minato-senpai can be surprisingly helpless at times\. That inconsistency is the nature of Minato-senpai's swordsmanship\.  
**Minato:** Ahaha\. That's why I couldn't win at the tournament either\~\.  
**Kanami:** But, you've beaten me so many times\.\.\.  
**Minato:** Hup\. Yep, that's just how it is\.  
**Kanami:** And that means, Kanami, you're already just as strong as me now\. You're a full fledged master\!  
**Kanami:** \.\.\.Ah, thank you very much\!  
**Minato:** My sweet, sweet, Kanami\. I wish I could have held you with my real body instead\. But, the sword is my everything\. I gave it all I had\.  
**Kanami:** Motherr\.\.\.\.\!  
**Kagari:** Hiyori\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** Mom\.\.\. Mom\! Uu\.\.\.  
**Kagari:** Once you've gone ahead, you can't come back\.  
**Hiyori:** Right\. Let's go, Kanami\.  
**Kanami:** Yeah\.  
**Minato:** So long-\! Take good care of yourselves\.  
**Kanami:** You too, mother\!  
**Minato:** Ahaha\. And how am I supposed to do that\?  
**Kagari:** You've always been so lively though\.  
**Minato:** Watching those girls, you can tell just how happy we must have been on the other side, can't you\.  
**Kagari:** I know\.  
**Minato:** Heyyy, why don't you come out and join us-\? You're here with us too, aren't you\?  
**Minato:** Want to have a match with me, before we disappear\? I bet you're still sore about losing to me\.  
**Tagitsu:** \.\.\.Very well\. Though, I cannot say how much time we have remaining\.  
**Minato:** Eheheheh\!  
**Hiyori:** Kanami\.  
**Kanami:** It's alright\. I'm right here\.  
**Hiyori:** Don't let go of my hand, no matter what\.  
**Kanami:** Yeah\. I'll never let go\.  

## 3: Recent Activities Report
And then, several days passed\. When the cherry blossoms were in full bloom--

  
**Mihono:** It's been a while since we got to meet face to face like this, huh\!  
**Kiyoka:** You say a while, but it's only been about a week, right\?  
**Mihono:** Wait, really\? I've been way too busy lately, so I've kinda lost my sense of time\.  
**Kiyoka:** There are so many more aradama appearing then before, aren't there\. It happens often that you think you're done suppressing some, but then they send you straight on to the next\.  
**Mihono:** There's that too, but, I've been busy studying\.\.\.  
**Kofuki:** Huhh\? If you're gonna lie about it, at least come up with something better than that\.  
**Mihono:** Rude-\! Is it that weird for me to be studying\?  
**Kofuki:** No duh, it's weird\. Putting it straight, you're a moron, Ahocchi\.  
**Mihono:** Gagh\! That's way too straight\! I mean, sure, my grades aren't great, but\.\.\.  
**Kofuki:** They're not even at the level of \"not great\"\. You're at the level where you'd get called into the guidance counseling office even though you're in an escalator school\. That's the place you're supposed to go for advice, not where they have to call you\.  
**Mihono:** Aha\.\.\. Ahahahaha\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** Hono-chan, that's not something you should laugh about\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** I know, right\.\.\. But, still\! You're the weird one for being able to pass on into high school, Fukki\! You traitor\!  
**Kofuki:** What do you mean, traitor\? It's a damn escalator school\! You normally just pass right into high school\! You're the weird one whose grades are too bad to do that\!  
**Kofuki:** \.\.\.Ah\! Mihocchi\! I mean, Ahocchi\! Hey\! You think that I'm a moron like you, don't you\!  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.Uhh\. S-So anyway, Chii-nee, what's it like in college\? It's probably different from high school, right\?  
**Kofuki:** And now you're forcing your way off the subject\!  
**Chie:** Hmm\~, the lectures are so technical, and everyone looks so adult\. I'm feeling nervous every day\.  
**Kofuki:** You look plenty adult yourself, Chichie\. Especially your tits\.  
**Chie:** Ufufu, that's very funny of you\. Kofuki-chan, will you come with me under the shade of that tree\?  
**Kofuki:** Hey, come on\.\.\. That smile freaks me out, so quit it\.\.\. Okay\? Miss Vice Captain\!  
**Chie:** Ah\.\.\. You know, is it really alright for me to take the position of vice captain of the investigation team\?  
**Kiyoka:** I think you're perfect for the job\!  
**Mirja:** You were appointed to the position precisely because those in charge found you suited for it\. Rather, I believe you should have been officially given this position long ago\.  
**Chie:** If that's how you feel, then I'm happy to hear it\. You've been busy researching Kashuu Kiyomitsu, haven't you, Mirja, Kiyoka-chan\?  
**Kiyoka:** We have\! There's been so many documents to search through\.\.\. It's a lot of work\!  
**Mirja:** We've spent day after day secluded in the Sword Administration Bureau's reference room\.  
**Mihono:** And what've you been up to, Fukki\?  
**Kofuki:** What, me\? I've been joining Kaoru and Sayaka's raid unit, spending the days having fun with aradama-chan\.  
**Kofuki:** Ah\~, by the way, where's Yui at\?  
**Mirja:** She has a routine health examination today\. She should be at the hospital right now\.  
**Kiyoka:** She told me earlier, along with getting her checkup, she's going to check in on Hana-san\.  
**Mihono:** That's right, Hana's doing her best with her rehab, so I've gotta try my hardest too\!  
**Mihono:** Huh\? Kashuu Kiyomitsu is crying out\? Is it resonating\?  
**Kiyoka:** Hono-chan, what is it\?  
**Mihono:** Sorry, I'm gonna go check on something\!  
**Kiyoka:** Wait, where are you going\?  
**Mihono:** I don't really know either\! But, I'll be back before the operation starts\!  
**Hana:** Come on\.\.\. Didn't I tell you, you shouldn't come back\! My rehabilitation's going fine\. That's all you have to tell the others\.  
**Hana:** You should get it, don't you\! Since you were a Myouga toji too\.\.\. Yui\!  
**Yui:** Hana-san\.\.\.  
**Hana:** How could I face them, if I saw them again\.\.\.  
**Hana:** The more the spell Tagitsuhime had over me comes undone, the more I get control over myself\.\.\. The more I feel this stabbing in my heart\.\.\.  
**Yui:** Nobody in the investigation team thinks it's your fault for what you did\!  
**Yui:** We're waiting for you\.\.\. For you to come back to us\. We're all waiting\.  
**Hana:** If only\.\.\. that's true\.  

## 4: The Return of Those You Await
**Mihono:** I had this feeling, like Kashuu Kiyomitsu was telling me to come here, but, what am I even doing\?  
**Mihono:** The operation's going to start soon too, so I'd better get back\.  
**Mihono:** It did it again\.\.\. You're telling me not to go\? Kiyomitsu\.\.\. What are you trying to get me to do\?  
**Mihono:** Hey\.\.\. Kiyomitsu\!  
**Hiyori:** The cherry blossoms\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** It's already spring, isn't it\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** What do you want to do first, Hiyori-chan\? You'd want to eat chocolate mint, right\?  
**Hiyori:** I wouldn't mind\.\.\.\!  
**Mihono:** K-Kanami\! Juujou-san\!\?  
**Kanami:** Eh\? Mihono-chan\? That means, we really did\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** We made it back, didn't we\.\.\.\!  
**Mihono:** Welcome back\!  
**Mihono:** Aww\~, I couldn't win in the end this year either\. Guess it wasn't going to go that easy\!  
**Mihono:** But, next time for sure\.\.\.\!  
**Referee:** Those who will be advancing to the finals, both of you, step forward\!  
**Kanami/Hiyori:** Yes ma'am\!  

## 5: Swords Gathered at Their Master's Side
One day, in May\. After the tournament, yet another month has passed\. The toji are now in the midst of their new routine--

  
**Suzuka:** Since the \"Great Year-End Disaster\", each organization has grown more active, and on top of that, there are sign of various groups forming behind closed doors\. Fending each of them off is only becoming more difficult\.  
**Suzuka:** The burden on Akane-sama as well, though it may not appear to be great at the moment, will only grow, as I believe it's only it's only a matter of time before someone appears to openly challenge her\.  
**Suzuka:** At present, this is about all I am able to report\.  
**Yukari:** \.\.\.I see, I understand\. I'm sorry, you three, for asking so much of you today\.  
**Yukari:** But, I wanted to hear it directly from the Special Defense Team\.\.\. From you, who work immediately under Akane\.  
**Maki:** Yukari-sama, how is your body doing now\?  
**Yukari:** I'm fine\. Doing well enough, at least, for me to finish what business I have left to pass the torch on\.  
**Suzuka:** Don't say that\.\.\. Someday, we'll need you to return to your office, Yukari-sama\.\.\.  
**Yukari:** No, I plan to leave everything to Akane, and remove myself from the public eye\.  
**Yukari:** At any rate, in the state I'm in now, I've lost even my power as a toji\.  
**Maki:** \.\.\.From when you sealed off the netherworld\?  
**Yukari:** That's right\. It consumed all my strength to finish\. Right now, I can hardly even wield an okatana\.  
**Yukari:** Even if my body were to make a full recovery, being able to stand again as a toji is something I can't much hope for\.  
**Yukari:** That's how things are, Yume\. You won't be able to charge me without warning like you once used to\.  
**Yume:** So I won't get to play with Yukari-sama anymore\.\.\. That's so boring\.  
**Maki:** Hey, Yume\! Yukari-sama, I'm very sorry about her\.  
**Yukari:** Don't think anything of it\.  
**Yume:** Still, wouldn't it be great if Yomi-onee-san could be here with us too\! Just like things used to be\! We'd all be together then\!  
**Yukari:** There are some concerning aspects to Yomi's condition, but she seems to be gradually recovering\.  
**Yume:** Then, when Yomi-onee-san gets back, I want us to go somewhere together again\! Like, when we all went flower viewing\!  
**Yume:** Don't ask the impossible, Yume\. You know what position Yukari-sama is in\.\.\.  
**Yukari:** No, when Yomi comes back to us, I'll work something out\.  
**Yume:** You mean it\!\? Hooray-\!  
**Yukari:** It won't be long before the four of you are together once more, as the Special Defense Team\.  
**Yukari:** \.\.\.And, from here on, Akane will face more enemies than I did\. Please, do all you can to look after her\.  
**Yui:** Sure thing\! No matter who crosses us, I'll keep Akane-sama safe\!  
**Yukari:** I see\.\.\. I'm depending on you, Yume\.  
**Yume:** Yeah\! Just leave it to me\!  
**Suzuka:** If only we could afford to spare more personnel\. As of now, we're short of hands wherever we go\.  
**Yukari:** I'd like to have Yamashiro Yui join as well, though I have my concerns after her doubled usage of the ampoules\. It's a difficult decision to make\.  
**Maki:** If only the rate of aradama appearances would go down at least\. At this rate\.\.\.  
**Yukari:** There's no use lamenting what can't be changed\. All that's left is to search for the best solution at hand\.  
**Maki:** Still, under Yanase's guidance, the next generation of toji are noticeably improving their skills\.  
**Suzuka:** If the shortage of toji is solved, and we can reinforce each station, the number of opportunities we'll have together should grow\.  
**Yume:** And then, I'll let you see a whole lot of what makes me so great\! Okay, Yukari-sama\!  
**Yukari:** Of course\. Once that time comes, that is\.  

## 6: Push On, Special Raid Unit\! (1\)
**Kaoru:** Oh, there you are, Kofuki\!  
**Nene:** Nenne-\!  
**Kofuki:** Yeah, thanks for letting me tag along again today\.  
**Tsugumi:** 1104 hours\. Shichinosato Kofuki makes contact with the captain of the Special Raid Unit, Mashiko Kaoru, as well as the aradama \"Nene\"\.  
**Kaoru:** I'll have you working your butt off again, Kofuki\. It's a real big help having you around\.  
**Kofuki:** I'll take care of all the aradama-chan, so you can take a nap or whatever\!  
**Kaoru:** That's a great idea\. I'd love to\!  
**Nene:** Nenne-\!  
**Tsugumi:** 1105 hours\. Mashiko Kaoru accepts Shichinosato Kofuki's proposal to take a nap\.  
**Sayaka:** Kaoru\. Director Maniwa will get mad again\.  
**Kofuki:** You can go ahead and take a break too, Sayaka\. I can handle this just fine on my own\!  
**Tsugumi:** Likewise, 1105 hours\. Shichinosato Kofuki makes contact with the vice captain of the Special Raid Unit, Itomi Sayaka\.  
**Sayaka:** Carelessness isn't allowed\. And also, suppressing aradama is my job\.  
**Kofuki:** Man, you always love doing things by the book\.  
**Kaoru:** But hey, haven't you been working with us more than the investigation team lately\?  
**Kaoru:** Everywhere you go, they're short on people, but we've got it real bad here\. Wouldn't it be best if you just officially transferred to us\?  
**Kaoru:** You'd get to fight all the aradama you want\. They totally ignore the Labor Standards Act, so you'd get worked you to the bone till you're run ragged\.  
**Tsugumi:** 1107 hours\. Mashiko Kaoru solicits Shichinosato Kofuki to join the Special Raid Unit, while criticizing the organization\.  
**Kofuki:** But, if I can't see Ahocchi's Miho side\.\.\. Ah, I messed it up\!		[Aho means dumb, and it's just a play on the nicknames]  
**Kofuki:** I'd get lonely, not getting to see Mihocchi's aho side\! So I'll pass on that for now\!  
**Kaoru:** Sayaka's value's going way up too\. If we added you to us, we'd be unstoppable\.  
**Kaoru:** And then, as the captain, my value'd go up as well, and I might even get promoted out of here\.  
**Nene:** Nene-\!  
**Tsugumi:** 1109 hours\. Mashiko Kaoru expresses her desire to withdraw from the Special Raid Unit, and to raise her own status\.  
**Sayaka:** Kaoru, you want to be promoted\?  
**Kaoru:** If I make it big, I'll get to make others do the work, and I'll get to kick back, won't I\?  
**Sayaka:** If you make it big, I think you'll get even busier\.  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.Aghh\~, I don't wanna work anymore-\!  
**Tsugumi:** 1110 hours\. Mashiko Kaoru expresses a clear desire to sabotage the chain of command\. I posit that this is necessary to report to General Director Maniwa\.  
**Kaoru:** Hey, shut up already\! What's your deal, anyway\!\? This whole time\! You've just been going on to yourself, like you can't even read the mood\! You know we can hear everything you're saying\!\?  
**Kofuki:** Ahh, she's an operator from the aradama research team\. You should've at least seen her around before\.  
**Tsugumi:** I'm to accompany you today, so that I can gather practical combat data from Shichinosato-san\. My name is Ban Tsugumi\. Nice to meet you\.  
**Kaoru:** Is it really okay, letting an operator tag along to the scene of a fight\? Wouldn't it be best to get her some bodyguards\?  
**Kofuki:** She'll be fine\. She knows what to do with this sorta thing\. She used to be a toji herself, so she's got skills of her own\.  
**Tsugumi:** Today, I will be dedicated to gathering data, so please don't pay me any mind\.  
**Kaoru:** Okay then\. Well, if Kofuki says you'll be fine, then you probably will\. Though, try not to do anything too crazy\.  
**Tsugumi:** Of course, I won't\.  
**Sayaka:** Kaoru, it's almost time to start the operation\.  
**Kaoru:** Can't catch a break\.\.\. Then, start doing what you can\.  
**Kofuki:** Hell yeah\! Here I come, my lovely aradama-chan\!  

## 7: Push On, Special Raid Unit\! (2\)
**Kofuki:** Give me more\! I still haven't had my fun yet\! Where's the next aradama at\!\?  
**Kaoru:** She's seriously so full of energy it's unbelievable\.\.\.  
**Sayaka:** It would be good if you could learn to be a little more like Kofuki, Kaoru\.  
**Kaoru:** I'm best suited to be a boss for capable recruits like you two\! That's how the Special Raid Unit should work\! Right, Nene\?  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.Huh\? Nene\?  
**Tsugumi:** [fluff fluff]\.\.\. [fluff fluff]\.\.\.  
**Nene:** Nenne-\! Nenne-\! Nenenenne-\!  
**Tsugumi:** [fluff fluff]\.\.\. [fluff fluff]\.\.\. [fluff fluff fluff]\.\.\.   
**Nene:** Nenenenene-\!  
**Tsugumi:** Aradama Nene shows a tendency of preferring to be touched to the side of the abdomen rather than straight on\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** What are you even doing playing around with Nene\?  
**Tsugumi:** You see, there are practically no opportunities to make direct physical contact with an aradama, so I thought I would gather some data\.  
**Tsugumi:** Today I have been able to gather practical combat data from not only Shichinosato-san, but also from Itomi-san and you, Mashiko-san, which will make for very good reference material\.  
**Kaoru:** I see, well that's good to hear then\.  
**Tsugumi:** 1308 hours\. Today's record will come to an end for the time being\.  
**Tsugumi:** Now then, I will gather there recordings into a report and present everything to General Director Maniwa today\. Thank you very much for having me\.  
**Kaoru:** Sure, thanks for putting in the effort\. Wait, hold on\.\.\. You're gonna present everything to the director\.\.\. Hey\!  
**Kaoru:** You're not seriously gonna report every single thing I said to her, are you-\!\? GIVE ME A BREAAAAAAAK\!\!  

## 8: We Aren't at Our Limit Yet\!
**Kanami:** Ah, Mai-chan\!  
**Mai:** Kanami-chan, it's been a while\!  
**Kanami:** Yeah, it really has, hasn't it\! Are you finished working at that whatever it was institute\?  
**Mai:** The Special Rare Metals Utilization Research Institute\. For now, it feels like we've come to a stopping point, I think\?  
**Kanami:** That's good then\. It means you can take it easy for a while, right\?  
**Mai:** I can't exactly do that\.  
**Mai:** As a representative of the Yanase Group, I need to help with the development of a new model of Storm Armor\.  
**Mai:** And also, to counter the increasing amount of aradama incidents, I have to put even more effort into raising up our underclassmen\.  
**Kanami:** You're amazing\.\.\. It's hard to even think I'm in the same grade as you anymore, Mai-chan\!  
**Mai:** You're amazing in that regard yourself, Kanami-chan\.  
**Kanami:** Eh\? What's so amazing about me\?  
**Mai:** All your accomplishments lately\! From the rumors, they're calling you the strongest toji right now\!  
**Kanami:** That's the first I've heard of it\!\? \.\.\.Wait\? Are you sure it's not a joke\?  
**Mai:** It's true\. They say nobody can match up against you\. That you're unstoppable\.  
**Kanami:** They're exaggerating way too much\! Even compared to Master, I still have a long long way to go\!  
**Kanami:** And besides, I even lost to Hiyori-chan at the tournament not that long ago\? I've gotta keep trying way harder to keep up too\!  
**Kanami:** And also, there's still Yume-chan, and they're saying Sayaka-chan is getting a lot stronger too\!  
**Mai:** Fufufu\! That modest attitude of yours might be the secret to your strength, Kanami-chan\.  
**Kanami:** I haven't gotten to see Hiyori-chan in a long while either\. It's like she's always been busy\. I'd really like to have a sparring session with her though\.  
**Kanami:** You've been busy too, Mai-chan, but don't push yourself too hard, okay\? If your body breaks down, it'll all go to waste\.  
**Mai:** You're right\. Let's both take good care of ourselves\. Anyway, I have a report to make\! I'll talk to you later\!  
**Kanami:** Sure\! See you around, Mai-chan\!  
**Kanami:** \.\.\.Everybody's working so hard\.  
**Kanami:** But I can do it too-\! After all, we've still got a long way to go before we hit our limits\!  

## 9: The Investigation Team's Day-To-Day (1\)
**Mihono:** Sighhh\~\~\~\.\.\.  
**Yui:** What's this, somebody's looking tired\. If you want, I'll pump you full of energy with a hug\~\! Hey, come on\! Mihono-chan\!  
**Mihono:** Ahh\~, Yui\. No thanks\.\.\.  
**Yui:** What's wrong, Mihono-chan\? Did you wind up seriously falling in love with me\? If that's what it is, then you're super welcome you know\!  
**Mihono:** Ahaha, I'm just a little worn out from studying\. I'll be fine, just fine\.\.\.  
**Chie:** I'm so proud of you, Mihono-chan, that you've studied till you're tired\. Up till now, you would always do everything you could to get away from textbooks\.  
**Mihono:** That's cause, things are so bad I can't afford to run away anymore\.\.\. If things keep up, I might really not make it into high school\.\.\.  
**Chie:** E-Err\~\.\.\. That sure sounds serious, doesn't it\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** It's bad enough just studying, but on top of that, just how many aradama do I have to fight every day\? I'm dead tired\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Ah, let's talk about something nicer\! Let's change the topic to something happy\! Like, if you've had any yummy cream puffs or something\!  
**Yui:** Then, I've got just the thing\! Hana-san's rehabilitation is going great, and it looks like she's making a steady recovery\!  
**Mihono:** Really\? That's so good to hear\.\.\. Hopefully Hana can make it out of the hospital soon\!  
**Mirja:** It truly is\. I can only pray for her speedy recovery\.  
**Yui:** Ah, Kiyoka-chan, Mirja-san\! You two are looking as lovely as ever today\. Want a hug\?  
**Mirja:** I'll have to refuse\.  
**Kiyoka:** I'm going to refuse too\.  
**Yui:** There you go again\~, acting like we're strangers\! You know you're always welcome to one\!  
**Chie:** Hey, how has your research into Kashuu Kiyomitsu been going\? Have you been making progress since last time\?  
**Kiyoka:** Unfortunately, we haven't found enough leads to say we've made any progress\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** Rather, it appears as though someone has intentionally removed details regarding Kashuu Kiyomitsu from the records\.  
**Mirja:** Even at Asakura Mihono's home\.\.\. We paid a visit to the Asakura Shrine, but there didn't seem to be any records of note there\.  
**Kiyoka:** For an okatana that once suppressed a great aradama before, there should be more records of it left behind\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** I guess so\.\.\. Well, I never heard anything about it either\. Mom and Grandpa never talked about it\.  
**Mihono:** By the way, I don't see Fukki around\. Is she out somewhere\?  
**Mirja:** If you're looking for Shichinosato Kofuki, she's currently on an aradama suppression mission with the Special Raid Unit\.  
**Kiyoka:** Whenever she doesn't have a mission with the investigation team, she's there with them practically every day\.  
**Mihono:** Well, it is Fukki, so she's probably just happy about getting to play with aradama\.  
**Yui:** Mmhmm, that's got to be it\! The way she innocently plays around with aradama; Kofuki-san's a real angel-\!  
**Chie:** The rate of aradama appearances has only gone up since the \"Great Year-End Disaster\"\. The Special Raid Unit must really value her too\.  
**Mihono:** Must be fun, getting to do what you love every day\~\! I'm so jealous of Fukki\~\!  
**Announcement:** Aradama have appeared in an urban area\! Toji are to intercept at once\. I repeat--  
**Mirja:** We have a mission to sortie\. All members, mobilize quickly\!  
**Mihono:** Eh\.\.\.\! But, Fukki's not here\!  
**Yui:** But, you have me here in her place\! This is the first big chance I've had to show off my cool side in a while\! Okaaay\~, here I go-\!  

## 10: The Investigation Team's Day-To-Day (2\)
**Kiyoka:** Yui-chan, you've really grown a lot stronger, haven't you\! We hardly had a chance to step in\.  
**Yui:** Ehehe, you could tell\? I've actually been doing super well lately\! Ah\! Don't tell me, you've fallen for me all over again\?  
**Kiyoka:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.Anyway, when we get back, we'll have to keep up our research on Kashuu Kiyomitsu\.  
**Yui:** Ah\! You're just forcing your way off the subject\! Come on-\.\.\. Though, the way you act like that makes my heart skip a beat too-\! Badump badump\!  
**Mihono:** And I'll have to keep reading textbooks\. Aghh\~, my heart's gonna break\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** No, wait\! I can't lose my nerve now\! They say every pinch you get in is just another opportunity\! Uagh\~\! Where there's a will, there's a way\!  
**Chie:** You still have another year too\. Hang in there, Mihono-chan\!  
**Mihono:** Urgh\! That's right\.\.\. Th-There's still another year of this\.\.\. Of this studying hell\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** I won't permit something so shameful as for our investigation team to have a failed student\. Do I make myself clear, Asakura Mihono\.\.\.\?  
**Mirja:** Do\. I\. Make\. Myself\. Clear\?  
**Mihono:** AHII\!\? Ahh\.\.\. Y-Yess\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** This year\! In both my studies and my missions\! I-I'll do my best\!  
In a virtual space established on a private network, connected over a special line--

  
**Young Man:** Well now, two of us are absent\.\.\. This is a rarity\. As far as I recall, this is the first it's happened, isn't it\?  
**Elderly Man:** It seems that some of the Origami protoge's little mice have slipped their way in\. I'm told they were off handling it\.  
**Elderly Man:** What else can we expect from Yukari's protege\. They seem to be some exceptionally talented little mice at that\.  
**Middle Aged Man A:** What's worse, if we ever show her an opening, the woman herself will try taking it in\. She's devious\.  
**Middle Aged Man A:** Even in the best circumstances, our counter-intelligence is in a precarious position\.  
**Middle Aged Man B:** It's finally awakened, and at a time we lack the funds, time, or people\.\.\.  
**Young Woman:** Oh\.\.\.\? And are the \"people\" you mention those idealists you send to die whenever it's convenient\? Sacrificial pawns are something you'll always run short of\.  
**Middle Aged Man B:** Bold words\.\.\. For a newcomer\.  
**Middle Aged Man A:** All the same, I'd like to leave off our concentrated investments into Tokyo at that\.  
**Middle Aged Man A:** This reconstruction bubble, it's nothing more than a smokescreen after all\.  
**Elderly Woman:** The Sword Administration Bureau too, would they only be dear and devote themselves to the grunts\. The grunts have no need of the brains, do they\.  
**Young Man:** Then, as the brains, why not do as brains do and move to discuss the matter at hand\.\.\.  
**Other:** The Whole Story  
**Kaoru:** That jackass\.\.\. She actually went and told her everything\! How can somebody be that clueless\!\?  
**Nene:** Ne-\!  
**Sayaka:** Kaoru, you aren't supposed to talk until you're done\. And also, you were the one in the wrong\.  
**Kaoru:** Grgh\.\.\. Aghh-, there, it's done\! Is that fine with you\! I wrote my apology letter\!  
**Sana:** Ohh-, you're finally through writing that thing\.  
**Sana:** Don't blame Ban for this\. Let this be your lesson not to criticize the higher-ups, when you're on the record, that is\.  
**Kaoru:** I didn't even say anything that bad, so why'd I have to write all this\.\.\.  
**Sana:** Anywhere you look, you can find people who'll complain about our structure and methods of their organization\.  
**Sana:** Would you rather we did something else\? We could cancel your vacation time, or dock your salary\?  
**Kaoru:** Grgh\.\.\. What's with this crooked administration\!  
**Sana:** Kaoru\.\.\. We understand full well that the Special Raid Unit is caught up in some hard work\.  
**Sana:** But, you get that work because of what we believe you're capable of, since you're a reliable captain\. Understand\?  
**Kaoru:** I get it\!  
**Sana:** Ah-, and also\. If you're going to crticize the higher-ups, do it more boldly\. When you meet the ones who complain about everything face to face, they almost always bite their tongue\.  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.I got it\!
