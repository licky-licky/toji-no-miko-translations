## 1: Maki and Suzuka's Unexpected Day Off
**Aradama:** GUOOOOOOOO\!  
**Maki:** Suzuka, it went that way\!  
**Suzuka:** Leave it to me.  
**Aradama:** OO OOoo o...  
**Suzuka:** Oh? Is that the end of them?  
**Maki:** Seems like it. I expected this to be tougher, but I'm glad we eliminated them quickly.  
**Suzuka:** We should be able to make it back sooner than planned. Since we're so far out in the mountains, let me confirm our location on my phone.  
**Suzuka:** Oh my\! Maki-san, will you look at this map? On the way back to the Origami household is...  
**Maki:** Did something happen?  
**Suzuka:** Yes, something big. An amusement park\!  
**Maki:** Amusement park? That's all...? Don't scare me like that.  
**Suzuka:** Maki-san, this is a rare opportunity, so would you like to go visit it together?  
**Maki:** Where's this coming from, Suzuka?  
**Suzuka:** We all need some relaxation every now and then.  
**Maki:** Ha... That's the sort of thing Yume would say.  
**Maki:** Though, we did finish our mission early, so it can't hurt. Let's go see what it's like.  
**Maki:** Hang on, Suzuka. Shouldn't we take a little break?  
**Suzuka:** Is that all it takes to tire out Shidou Maki, first seat of the elite guard?  
**Maki:** No, I still have plenty of stamina to go. But your clothes and hair are still wet from the water coaster, aren't they? Here, I'll use my handkerchief.  
**Suzuka:** Oh, you're right about that.  
**Suzuka:** Fufu, thank you very much. Your hair is wet too, Maki-san. Let me use my handkerchief.  
**Maki:** Thanks. I didn't think there'd be that much water splashing down, but the intensity of it all was exciting.  
**Suzuka:** You don't mean you were scared, do you?  
**Maki:** Of course not. I wouldn't be scared by something like that...  
**Suzuka:** You say that, Maki-san, but you were screaming so loud on the roller coaster, remember?  
**Maki:** Haha, oh, that? That wasn't fear; just my kind of etiquette.  
**Maki:** Isn't screaming on a thrill ride the highest form of respect to its creator? That's why, when I'm enjoying one, I let it all out and scream as much as I can.  
**Suzuka:** Fufu, I don't think you need to be that conscientious... But, it's quite like you.  
**Suzuka:** You know, with the two of us having a good time like this, we must look like ordinary high school girls.  
**Maki:** You're right. It's been a long while since we had the time to purely play around like this. What should we ride next?  
**Suzuka:** That's true. Next, let's get on the merry go round.  
**Maki:** You have some unexpectedly girlish tastes, you know.  
**Suzuka:** Horseriding has always been one of my specialities since I was young, so I'd like to take this chance to show my skills...  
**Maki:** Well I'd love to see that. Let's go, come on.  
**Suzuka:** Ah, you took, my hand...  
**Maki:** What's wrong, Suzuka? Your face is red. Are you feeling sick?  
**Suzuka:** I-I feel just fine.  
**Maki:** Good then.  
**Maki:** Hm? My phone's ringing. Yes, this is Shidou Maki. More aradama? Understood, we'll be right there.  
**Maki:** Suzuka, aradama have appeared in the area. We need to deal with them.  
**Suzuka:** What unromantic aradama, arriving at a time like this.  
**Maki:** If we defeat them and head right back, we should still have time to go on rides.  
**Suzuka:** That's right, let's get them taken care of\!  

## 2: How Toji Enjoy an Amusement Park
**Kanami:** Hiyori-chan, check it out\! They have a roller coaster, and go karts, and even a water coaster\!  
**Hiyori:** Mai's parents are impressive, knowing the owners of such a large amusement park.  
**Kanami:** I wish Mai-chan and the rest could've come with us...  
**Hiyori:** Mai said she had plans with her family, so there's nothing we can do about it. And Kaoru, Ellen, and Sayaka are all on missions.  
**Hiyori:** She already gave us the tickets, so we should enjoy this place to its fullest and have something good to tell Mai about later.  
**Kanami:** That's a good point. We need to have enough fun for all of them\!  
**Hiyori:** Still, don't let your guard down, Kanami. We might be off duty, but if aradama appear, we should help deal with them right away.  
**Kanami:** Yeah, of course\!  
**Hiyori:** Good. Then, what should we ride first?  
**Kanami:** Ahaha, you're getting into it too, aren't you, Hiyori-chan?  
**Hiyori:** W-We came all this way to the amusement park, so of course we're going to ride something.  
**Kanami:** You're right. So why don't we get on the roller coaster first?  
**Hiyori:** Mm, that's not a bad idea.  
**Kanami:** Alright\! Let's go.  
**Hiyori:** Oi, wait, Kanami\! You're leaving me behind.  
**Hiyori:** That was one intense roller coaster, especially when it went up high.  
**Kanami:** Yeah. I was screaming so much my throat's sore. My eyes are all dried out too.  
**Hiyori:** Nn? Your eyes are dry?  
**Kanami:** While we were riding, I didn't want to blink, so I kept my eyes open the whole time.  
**Hiyori:** ...Why would you do that?  
**Kanami:** Roller coasters go so fast, so I figured, if I don't close my eyes, wouldn't I be able to train my dynamic vision?  
**Kanami:** It'll turn into swordfighting experience, I'm sure of it\! Roller coasters are so much fun\!  
**Hiyori:** Your idea of fun is definitely wrong...  
**Hiyori:** Well whatever. What should we ride next?  
**Kanami:** Why don't we go in the haunted house? It's a different kind of thrill than a rollercoaster.  
**Hiyori:** A different thrill...? That sounds profound. Let's go in.  
**Hiyori:** It was all bark and no bite, that haunted house.  
**Kanami:** Hiyori-chaaaan\~... A haunted house isn't the kind of attraction you go in to fight the ghosts\!  
**Hiyori:** It's not?  
**Kanami:** You're supposed to get scared when you see the ghosts, but you shouted "There you are, ghost\!\" and tried to beat them. You're the one who scared me.  
**Hiyori:** But, if they're going to threaten us, it's our right to fight back.  
**Kanami:** You're the one who doesn't know how to have fun, Hiyori-chan...  
**Kanami:** Ah, phone call.  
**Kanami:** Yes, this is Etou Kanami. ...Okay, understood.  
**Kanami:** Hiyori-chan, there was an aradama outbreak near here\!  
**Hiyori:** I see. That haunted house was a good warmup. Let's go\!  
**Hiyori:** Hm? Isn't that Kiyoka and Mirja over there?  
**Mirja:** Etou Kanami, Juujou Hiyori. Were you also on your way to defeat the aradama that appeared?  
**Kanami:** Yeah, they just called me about it. We happened to be nearby, so we could come deal with it right away. Were you two also in the area?  
**Kiyoka:** We came to look into the Akabane swords around here.  
**Mirja:** It would be reassuring, having the two of you with us. Let's head toward the scene.  

## 3: We Can't Be Seen?
**Mirja:** All clear, extermination complete.  
**Kiyoka:** Pant, pant... We managed to beat them...  
**Kanami:** I'm glad we ran into you, Musumi-san, Kitora-san. Hiyori-chan, it's not closing time yet, is it?  
**Hiyori:** It should still be open.  
**Kiyoka:** Open? What are you talking about?  
**Kanami:** There's an amusement park near here that we were playing in.  
**Hiyori:** We have tickets that are valid for today only, but the others were all too busy to come.  
**Kiyoka:** That doesn't surprise me. An amusement park, huh... That sounds like fun...  
**Kanami:** If you want, you and Kitora-san should come with us\!  
**Kiyoka:** Can we?  
**Hiyori:** We have enough tickets for four people. And it'd make Mai happy to know they didn't go to waste.  
**Kiyoka:** Then I want to go\!  
**Kiyoka:** Mirja-san, we took care of the aradama, so...  
**Mirja:** I see nothing wrong with it. Our mission is completed, and this is a good stopping point, so we may as well.  
**Kiyoka:** Yes\!  
**Kanami:** They're closing soon, so we should race back there\!  
**Kiyoka:** Okay\!  
At that time, the two from the elite guard were--

  
**Suzuka:** We made it back safely before the park closed.  
**Maki:** It's a good thing we dealt with them so quickly.  
**Maki:** You seemed stronger than usual today, Suzuka. Did you want to ride the merry go round that badly?  
**Suzuka:** I always put all my efforts into suppressing aradama.  
**Maki:** Right, that was rude of me. Anyway, we're back now, so let's pick up where we left off.  
**Maki:** And this is the place. Ready to show me those horseriding skills you're so proud of?  
**Suzuka:** Of course; let's get on that white horse over there. Hah-\!  
**Kanami:** Huh?  
**Kanami:** Over there, isn't that... Shidou-san and Konohana-san\!\?  
**Hiyori:** Wha, am I hallucinating?  
**Mirja:** The Shidou Maki and Konohana Suzuka are...  
**Kiyoka:** Laughing and riding the merry go round together...  
**Kiyoka:** Ah-, they're getting off. Hide\!  
**Hiyori:** I went along with it and hid, but...  
**Mirja:** Why should we need to hide?  
**Kiyoka:** Sorry, I just felt like we saw something we weren't supposed to be seeing...  
**Kanami:** Well why don't we just watch them like this for a while?  
**Suzuka:** I had a good time on the merry go round. On top of that, I now have this photo of Maki-san riding a white horse to make as my phone's background.  
**Maki:** Wh-When did you take that picture\!\? If anybody else saw me like that...  
**Suzuka:** And with this, I have Maki-san's weakness in the palm of my hand.  
**Maki:** You wouldn't\!  
**Suzuka:** Ufufu, I'm only joking\~.  
**Kiyoka:** They're like completely different people from when they're fighting...  
**Kanami:** Yeah, they look like they're having a good time. Why don't we try calling out to them and joining up?  
**Mirja:** Etou Kanami, that wouldn't be very tactful of you. The two of them must rarely get to spend time like this together, so we shouldn't disturb them.  
**Hiyori:** Ahh, I agree... I have no idea how I'm supposed to react to them...  
**Kanami:** Mmmm, that's a good point. Then, why don't we go ride something else?  

## 4: It's Always a Serious Competition
**Kiyoka:** So many attractions look like fun that I can't make up my mind. What can the four of us do together...  
**Kanami:** Ah\! Let's race the go karts over there\! It'd be cool to have a showdown with each other.  
**Hiyori:** A showdown? That could be good.  
**Mirja:** I agree, I'll join in.  
**Kiyoka:** If everyone wants to do it... Me too.  
**Hiyori:** Hmm... I thought it would be more intended for children, but that looks like a proper course.  
**Mirja:** The kart's frames look to be the latest model. This should be a good environment for a conclusive showdown.  
**Kiyoka:** Are we going to be driving these...? I wonder how safe it is...  
**Kanami:** Musumi-san, you can drive as safely as you feel like.  
**Hiyori:** That's right, you shouldn't feel pressured to drive any faster than you're comfortable with. Just go at your own pace.  
**Hiyori:** However-- I'm going on an all out offensive. I'll start from the innermost track. Does anyone mind?  
**Kiyoka:** Eh? Does it matter where you start from? They all go the same way.  
**Hiyori:** That's naive, Kiyoka. Starting closer to the inside gives you a shorter route to the goal. You need to take the course considering the fundamentals of racing.  
**Kanami:** Ooh, Hiyori-chan's eyes are lighting up like when she's going into battle...\!  
**Kanami:** Wait, then I want to start from the inside too\! I won't lose to Hiyori-chan\!  
**Kanami:** We should do a game of rock-paper-scissors to decide who starts there.  
**Hiyori:** Hm... Fine then. Our showdown begins with rock-paper-scissors. There's no way I'm losing.  
**Kanami:** Me neither\!  
**Kiyoka:** (Wow... Those two, they're so serious about this...)  
**Hiyori:** Hm? By the way, what happened to Mirja? I haven't seen her since we got here...  
**Mirja:** Excuse me, I kept you waiting.  
**Kiyoka:** Where'd you go, Mirja-san?  
**Mirja:** To the park office, so I could borrow some tools.  
**Kanami:** Tools? For what?  
**Mirja:** For modifying the engine.  
**Kiyoka:** Ehh\!\?  
**Mirja:** In the world of competition, it's only natural to take every available avenue towards seizing victory.  
**Hiyori:** I get it... Not just thinking of where you start, but the machine you start in. Not bad, Mirja.  
**Kiyoka:** Should you really be impressed by that\!\?  
**Kiyoka:** This is looking like an even more dangerous competition than I thought...  
At the same time, Maki and Suzuka were walking nearby--

  
**Suzuka:** That's an incredible noise they're making.  
**Maki:** That must be the engines of the go karts over there.  
**Maki:** Th-They're fast\! I didn't think karts these days could reach those speeds.  
**Maki:** I want to try driving one, but the park's about to close.  
**Suzuka:** In that case, why not come back here again? We were on a mission today, so we're still in uniform, but we can dress up and come back next time we have a day off\!  
**Maki:** Ahh, I'd like that.  

## 5: Amusement Park Memories
**Yui:** Oh yeah, Kiyoka-chan, when the investigation team has time off, where do you go for fun?  
**Kiyoka:** Hmm... Everyone gets different days off, so it's hard getting us all together.  
**Kiyoka:** Ah, but not too long ago, I went with Mirja-san to an amusement park after a mission.  
**Yui:** Mirja-san went to an amusement park\!\? I'd never have guessed you're into those\!  
**Mirja:** I'm willing to go to amusement parks. And, at the time, Etou Kanami and Juujou Hiyori offered us tickets.  
**Yui:** Oh, really? That sounds like a good time, everyone at the amusement park.  
**Kiyoka:** Yes\! It was\! You should come with us next time, Yui-chan\!  
**Yui:** Ah... Sorry\! I'm super happy you invited me, but I won't go to amusement parks...  
**Kiyoka:** Eh? Why not?  
**Mirja:** Are you not good with the rides?  
**Yui:** It's not like that...  
**Yui:** To tell the truth, for years now, my little sister's been sick in the hospital.  
**Yui:** When she was first starting elementary school, we went to an amusement park together.  
**Yui:** But she was still really short at the time, so she couldn't ride the roller coaster.  
**Yui:** So on the way home, I promised her that, when she's tall enough to ride, we'd go together again.  
**Yui:** ...But my little sister isn't ready for that promise yet.  
**Yui:** Even now, she still brings it up. When she's better, she wants to go with me.  
**Yui:** So I made up my mind too; that until she's feeling better I won't go to an amusement park with anyone.  
**Mirja:** Is that a form of offering?  
**Kiyoka:** Offering...? What do you mean?  
**Mirja:** When making a prayer, you vow to give up something you enjoy. The idea is that through abstinence, your prayer becomes stronger.  
**Yui:** I see\~\! That's sort of like it\! I must be feeling superstitious.  
**Yui:** ...Hey, cut it out, you two. You don't have to go feeling all sorry for my sake\~.  
**Yui:** After all, there's not a doubt in my mind my sister's going to get better\!  
**Yui:** So once she gets out of the hospital, let's all go to an amusement park together\!  
**Kiyoka:** --Sure\!  
**Mirja:** Okay. I'll look forward to it.
