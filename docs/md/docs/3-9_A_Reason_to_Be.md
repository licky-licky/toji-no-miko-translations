## 1: Reinforcements (1)
At that time, in Kashima's industrial district. Origami Yukari and Ichikishimahime were--

  
**Ichikishima:** ...This "industrial area" is like a labyrinth. A fitting place for one such as myself, who cannot see where she is headed...  
**Ichikishima:** However, all things here are vital to human livelihood. Such a vast difference from myself, whose existence goes unneeded.  
**Yukari:** Ichikishimahime. This may sound like a joke, but is it possible for you to fuse with me again?  
**Ichikishima:** It is not.  
**Ichikishima:** Once the three of us had left, you were no longer...  
**Yukari:** --\!\!  
**Imperial Guard A:** Origami Yukari, Ichikishimahime. We finally tracked you down.  
**Imperial Guard B:** We'll be taking her in\!  
**Yukari:** ...You won't.  

## 2: Reinforcements (2)
**Imperial Guard A:** Origami Yukari... She's as tough as you'd expect...  
**Imperial Guard B:** Even so, the area is being surrounded by the imperial guard. There's nowhere for her to run.  
**Ichikishima:** --Yukari. The enemy has brought reinforcements.  
**Yukari:** So they have.  
**Imperial Guard C:** Origami Yukari\! You can give up now\!  
**Yukari:** --Heh.  
**Imperial Guard C:** Do you find this funny\!\?  
**Yukari:** No... We just seem to have reinforcements of our own.  
**Imperial Guard C:** Huh...?  
**Imperial Guard C:** --Ahh\!\!  
**Kanami:** Yukari-sama\! Sorry we're late\!  
**Mai:** We'll keep them busy\! Please take Ichikishimahime and escape\!  
**Kaoru:** Go on ahead; we'll handle things here\!  
**Kaoru:** ...I've always wanted to use that line.  
**Yukari:** --Sorry about this.  
**Imperial Guard C:** Stop-\!  
**Sayaka:** ...You aren't getting past.  
**Ellen:** Not unless you deal with us first\!  
**Imperial Guard C:** Gr...\!\!  
**Hiyori:** I hope you're ready, imperial guard.  
**Kanami:** Everyone\! Let's do this\!   

## 3: Satsuki Yomi (1)
While that was happening, in Kashima's industrial district, the three former elite guards were--

  
**Imperial Guard A:** Shidou Maki\! Prepare yourself-\!  
**Maki:** --HAAHH-\!\!  
**Imperial Guard A:** GYAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Maki:** ...Yukari-sama should be somewhere here in this industrial area.  
**Suzuka:** However, with the imperial guard appearing one after another, we aren't able to get any searching done.  
**Yume:** Why do they keep throwing themselves at us when they're so weak?  
**Maki:** Maybe they think they can beat us if they attack consecutively for long enough. Or maybe...  
**Suzuka:** They have a reason to stall us however they can.  
**Suzuka:** For example... If they're waiting for the arrival of a toji skilled enough to defeat us.  
**Yume:** No way, Suzuka-onee-san. There's nobody in this mishmash of toji who could do anything to us\~\!  
**Maki:** ...No, there is someone. More than likely, she's the one leading the imperial guard right now--  
**Suzuka:** Yes, just her.  
**Maki:** I guess we now know why they're stalling us.  
**Yume:** Those aradama... They're Yomi-onee-san's\!\?  
**Maki:** That's right. But she doesn't seem to be here to greet us.  
**Suzuka:** In that case, we can drag out Yomi-san after we finish with these.  

## 4: Satsuki Yomi (2)
**Maki:** That should be all these aradama disposed of.  
**Suzuka:** Which leaves us with finding Yomi-san...  
**Yume:** Ah\!\! Look\!\! Yomi-onee-san's over there\!\!  
**Yomi:** ...Tsubakuro-san? Is that really you, Tsubakuro-san...?  
**Yume:** It's me\! Yomi-onee-san\! Let's go back to being the elite guard with all four of us again\!  
**Yomi:** ......  

## 5: Uchizato Ayumu (1)
At that time, in Kashima's industrial district, Etou Kanami and the girls of Ichikishimahime's main rescue team were--

  
**Ellen:** HYAHH\!\!  
**Kaoru:** KIEEEEEE\!\!  
**Nene:** NE NEEEE\!  
**Sayaka:** ...There's so many reinforcements.  
**Hiyori:** I know, every time I turn around there's more.  
**Kanami:** There's just no end to them...  
**Kaoru:** We're trying to go a little easy on them here, but they're coming with all they've got.  
**Ellen:** Kaoru, complaining won't get them to change their minds\!  
**Kaoru:** I know that. But after this is over, nothing's stopping me from getting a vacation\!  
**Nene:** Nenne-\!\!  
**Kaoru:** Sayaka\! When we go on vacation, I'm getting my revenge on you in table tennis, okay\!  
**Sayaka:** ...Okay.  
**Mai:** It really does feel like they could keep coming forever...  
**Mai:** --Kanami-chan\! Hiyori-chan\! The four of us can manage here, so you two should go guard Yukari-sama and Ichikishimahime\!  
**Kanami:** Got it\! Let's go, Hiyori-chan\!  
**Hiyori:** Right\!  
**Imperial Guard:** Stop right there\! You won't get to do as you please\!  

## 6: Uchizato Ayumu (2)
**Hiyori:** Finally, they're out of the way...  
**Kanami:** Now to catch up to Yukari-sama and Ichikishimahime--  
**Ayumu:** Etou-san\!  
**Kanami:** ...Ayumu-chan?  
**Ayumu:** I've been waiting so long for this\! For the day I could fight you\!  
**Kanami:** Ayumu-chan...\!  
**Hiyori:** Kanami\! Aren't you coming\!\?  
**Kanami:** --Sorry, Hiyori-chan\! Go ahead without me\!  
**Hiyori:** ............Fine then.  
**Ayumu:** Come on, let's fight, Etou-san\! A serious clash of our skills\!  
**Kanami:** ......  

## 7: We Won't Let You Go\! (1)
**Imperial Guard:** Don't let Origami Yukari and Ichikishimahime escape\! After them\!  
**Kaoru:** Whoa, hold it right there\! You're not getting an inch past me\!  
**Kaoru:** ...Hnnng\~\! I always wanted to say that one too.  
**Imperial Guard:** Grgh... You think you can get in our way...\!  
**Ellen:** We did something like this before too, didn't we. When we entered the Origami estate and let Kanamin and the others go on ahead.  
**Mai:** Kanami-chan and Hiyori-chan are without a doubt our strongest fighters.  
**Mai:** So, no matter what it takes, I know we have to help them reach Yukari-sama.  
**Sayaka:** Mm. If that's what you think, Mai, then I'll trust you.  
**Sayaka:** I'll defeat everyone who tries to stop them.  
**Imperial Guard:** Just try if you think you can\!\!  

## 8: We Won't Let You Go\! (2)
**Ellen:** Phew... I think that's about half of the guards here taken care of.  
**Sayaka:** There will be reinforcements coming. We have to stay on guard.  
**Mai:** Yukari-sama made it away, so when the timing is right, we might be able to retreat as well.  
**Kaoru:** --Huh? Oi, wasn't Kanami supposed to go protect Origami Yukari? Isn't that her in a 1v1 over there?  
**Sayaka:** Yes. ...That girl seems different to Kanami than the other toji.  
**Kaoru:** What does that have to do with anything? What the hell is she thinking at a time like this...  

## 9: A Strike Full of Feeling (1)
**Kanami:** --Ayumu-chan\! Please, just stop fighting\!  
**Ayumu:** But why\! This is my mission, and we're toji, and toji fight together\!  
**Ayumu:** I got stronger so I could fight with you, Etou-san\! I have to fight with everything I have\!  
**Kanami:** (It's no use... I can't talk sense into her...)  
**Kanami:** (Because of the noro, she's not acting rationally...)  
**Kanami:** ...Is this the strength you wanted, Ayumu-chan?  
**Ayumu:** Yes\! The strength I got so I could fight you, Etou-san\!  
**Ayumu:** I'm strong now, aren't I\!\?  
**Kanami:** ...Okay. Then I can't fight with you, Ayumu-chan.  
**Ayumu:** ......\!\? Why not\!\?  
**Kanami:** ...When we first met, when I found out how much you liked swordfighting too, I was really happy.  
**Kanami:** I thought we could have fun getting stronger together.  
**Ayumu:** Fun...? I don't understand what you're saying\!  
**Ayumu:** Come on, Etou-san\!\! Please... Please fight with me\!\!  

## 10: A Strike Full of Feeling (2)
**Ayumu:** Urgh...  
**Kanami:** --I just put all my feelings into that strike.  
**Kanami:** Because I know you'll be able to take it.  
**Kanami:** ...I'm sorry, Ayumu-chan. I have to go after Yukari-sama.  
**Kanami:** ...Let's have another match someday.  

## 11: Elite Guard VS Elite Guard (1)
**Maki:** Yomi...  
**Suzuka:** What are you doing to yourself, without utsushi...  
**Yomi:** ...I have no more of my life to give if I hope to defeat you.  
**Yume:** You're serious about this, Yomi-onee-san.  
**Yomi:** I am. Please come at me with the intent to kill. I will do the same.  
**Suzuka:** --\!\? You'd let the noro eat away at your body just to be strengthened by an aradama...\!\?  
**Maki:** Stop it, Yomi\! You can still come back from this\!  
**Yomi:** What about you, Shidou-san? Will you be fine repressing the aradama in you?  
**Maki:** I will\! Because I have people I can rely on more than aradama now\!  
**Suzuka:** Well, as sappy as that was, I'll accept the flattery.  
**Yomi:** ...I don't mind if you resent me for this.  

## 12: Elite Guard VS Elite Guard (2)
**Yomi:** Urgh...  
**Suzuka:** You may resent me as well... Yomi-san.  
**Suzuka:** ...There's no coming back for you, is there...  
**Yomi:** ...No, there isn't.  
**Yomi:** No matter how twisted the path, as long as she walks it...  
**Yume:** Ah... Yomi-onee-san\!  
**Maki:** She left. So that's it...  
**Suzuka:** Yes...  
**Yume:** She looked like she made up her mind. I thought that the four of us could finally be back together again.  
**Yume:** Why would Yomi-onee-san act like that...?  
**Maki:** ...Yomi was unique even among the elite guard.  
**Maki:** Maybe we should have been trying harder to understand her.  
**Suzuka:** Yomi-san was likely fighting for a different purpose than we were.  
**Suzuka:** ...Here, let's resume our search for Yukari-sama...  

## 13: At Kashima Shrine (1)
**Ichikishima:** ...Kashima Shrine. Dedicated to Takemikazuchi, god of thunder and martial arts.  
**Yukari:** And the birthplace of Kashima Shinto-ryu. I've visited here before, together with Kagari and Yuzuki.  
**Ichikishima:** ......  
**Yukari:** What's the matter?  
**Ichikishima:** Kagari, Yuzuki. They are the humans you need... While, I...  
**Yukari:** ...Why do you think I was able to hold onto myself for the twenty years I remained host to the great aradama?  
**Yukari:** Because of you... Because you were there with me, Ichikishimahime.  
**Ichikishima:** Me...?  
**Yukari:** Tormented by the severity of Tagitsuhime and the rationality of Takirihime, my humanity was fading day by day.  
**Yukari:** But because of you... Because I had the cautious, timid, and self-defeating Ichikishimahime within me, I was able to stay human.  
**Yukari:** You aren't an unnecessary existence. More than anyone else... I need you.  
**Ichikishima:** Yukari...  
**Mihono:** --Ahh\!\! Yukari-sama\!\! I finally found you\!\!  
**Yukari:** Asakura... The girl chosen by Kiyomitsu.  
**Yukari:** I see... So you came. Carrying the end of an unbreakable sword within you, you came here, now.  
**Yukari:** It's too much to call coincidence. The will, the fate, of Kashuu Kiyomitsu. That's what this is.  
**Yukari:** Fufu... So that's why. After twenty years, I understand at last.  
**Mihono:** Huh? Uhhh, what are you...  
**Yukari:** Asakura Mihono\!\! Get back\!\!  
**Mihono:** Huh-\!\?  
**Tagitsu:** --Have you been well? I've longed to see you, Ichikishimahime.  
**Mihono:** Tagitsuhime... And the imperial guard with her...\!\!  
**Tagitsu:** Ichikishimahime, become mine. In doing so, I shall grant you meaning.  
**Yukari:** Tagitsuhime... I won't allow it\!\!  
**Imperial Guard A:** Tagitsuhime-sama\! Please, leave this to us\!  
**Imperial Guard B:** Origami Yukari\! Ichikishimahime\! Prepare yourselves\!  

## 14: At Kashima Shrine (2)
**Imperial Guard A:** Ngh...\!\! So strong...\!\!  
**Tagitsu:** ...You're in my way.  
**Imperial Guard A:** AGHHHHH\!\!  
**Imperial Guard B:** Tagitsuhime-sama... Why...  
**Tagitsuhime:** Enough of these games. I will take you myself.  
**Yukari:** Gagh\!\!  
**Ichikishima:** Yukari-\!\!  
**Yukari:** ...Ichikishimahime, I'll give you time. Hurry and get away from here.  
**Ichikishima:** Kh...\!\!  
**Ichikishima:** Yukari... Just hold on\!  
**Yukari:** Good... That's it.  
**Yukari:** Asakura Mihono, you run as well.  
**Mihono:** --I won't.  
**Yukari:** What...\!\?  
**Mihono:** Yukari-sama\!\! I'll stay with you... I'll fight\!\!  

## 15: Sword of the Thunder God (1)
At that time, only a short distance away from Kashima Shrine--

  
**Ichikishima:** Juujou-- Hiyori.  
**Hiyori:** --Huh\!\?  
**Hiyori:** You... You're Ichikishimahime\!\? Why are you here, alone...  
**Ichikishima:** I want you to lend me your power.  
**Ichikishima:** --No, I want to entrust my power to you.  
**Hiyori:** Grh\!\!　Don't be ridiculous\!\! You're just another part of Tagitsuhime\!\!  
**Hiyori:** Just the same great aradama that made my mother suffer\!\! So, why would I\!  
**Ichikishima:** Even so, I want to entrust myself to you, Juujou Hiyori.  
**Ichikishima:** ...I want to save Origami Yukari, who said I was needed.  
**Hiyori:** Kh.........  
**Yukari:** Asakura Mihono\! Run away\! You stand no chance against her\!  
**Mihono:** I'll be fine\!\! Where there's a will, there's a way\!\!  
**Tagitsuhime:** It does not bother me. There is no great difference whether I swat one fly or two.  
**Tagitsuhime:** Try to entertain me some, will you?  

## 16: Sword of the Thunder God (2)
**Mihono:** Pant... Pant...  
**Tagitsuhime:** You put up a short fight, but even with two you could not hope to defeat me.  
**Tagitsuhime:** Just a woman outliving her time. Even so, you were once my... No, nothing more than a broken vessel now.  
**Yukari:** Ngh...\!\!  
**Tagitsuhime:** Now then, it's time you died.  
**Tagitsuhime:** ...\!\?  
**Yukari:** Takemikazuchi...? --It can't be\!\?  
**Yukari:** Kogarasumaru... Juujou Hiyori...  
**Mihono:** Juujou-san\!\? Wait, that's Juujou-san\!\?  
**Tagitsuhime:** So you've found yourself a new vessel, Ichikishimahime...  
**Tagitsuhime:** Then, I will draw back.  
**Mihono:** Tagitsuhime... You scared her off, Juujou-san\!  
**Hiyori:** --Don't come near me\!\!  
**Mihono:** -\!\? Wh-Why\!\?  
**Hiyori:** Urgh... AGHHHHH\!\!  
**Yukari:** This isn't good\!\! Juujou Hiyori doesn't have control over the aradama's power\!\!  
**Hiyori:** Ugh... Ghrh... AAAGGHHH\!\!  

## 17: Sword of the Thunder God (3)
**Hiyori:** Aghh... Ahh...\!\!  
**Mihono:** Juujou-san... Does it hurt...?  
**Yukari:** ...After using her power, she seems to have calmed down some. Though...  
**Kanami:** --Hiyori-chaaaan\!\! Yukari-sama\!\!  
**Mihono:** Kanami\!\?  
**Kanami:** Ah\! Mihono-chan, you're here too\!  
**Kanami:** What's going on? What happened here? Ichikishimahime, where is she?  
**Kanami:** --\!\?  
**Kanami:** H-Hiyori-chan...\!\?  
**Yukari:** ...The person before you is both Juujou Hiyori and Ichikishimahime.  
**Kanami:** Huh\!\?  
**Yukari:** Juujou Hiyori has absorbed the great aradama. The same as I once did.  
**Hiyori:** AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH\!\!  
**Other:** The Source of the Lightning?  
**Chie:** ...Did anyone else see that\!\?  
**Mirja:** Yes... In the direction of Kashima Shrine... That was... Clearly not a natural phenomenon.  
**Kofuki:** No way, with that bigass lightning strike. Must have had something to do with an aradama. And a big shot too.  
**Mirja:** Then... Tagitsuhime? Still, why would such a massive lightning strike occur...  
**Kiyoka:** I don't know... What if, something happened to Hono-chan...  
**Chie:** Mihono-chan...  
**Mirja:** Did I misjudge the situation, sending Asakura Mihono there alone...? Another of my mistakes...  
**Kofuki:** Oi, Mirja. It's too early for that stuff\! We don't even know anything yet.  
**Kofuki:** I'm tired of fighting people, and things are looking interesting over there. Come on, guys\! Let's check out where that lightning hit\!
