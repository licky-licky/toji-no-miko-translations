## 1: The Head of the Origami Family and Nene
Several hours before the tournament began--

  
**Kaoru:** Hmm-? Huh, that's weird... He was just here a minute ago... Hey, Ellen. You seen Nene anywhere?  
**Ellen:** Nene? Now that you mention it, I haven't.  
**Kaoru:** Damnit, that little... Did he forget he's an aradama or something?  
**Bodyguard Toji:** Find it\! It has to be around here somewhere\! Tch, to think we let an aradama all the way in here...\!  
**Nene:** Ne-...\!  
**Bodyguard Toji:** Th-There it is\! So that's where you were hiding\!  
**Nene:** N-Nenene-\!\?  
**Yukari:** ...They're awfully noisy out there...  
**Nene:** Ne...  
**Yukari:** You're the one from the Mashiko family...  
**Nene:** Nene, nene-\!  
**Yukari:** But what are you doing here? Don't you understand what this place is?  
**Nene:** Ne-? Nene, nenene-.  
**Yukari:** Where is the Mashiko toji? Shouldn't you always be at her side?  
**Nene:** Ne-, nene-\! Nenene-\! Ne-, nene-\!  
**Yukari:** ...There's no point in attempting conversation, is there...  
**Yukari:** Fine then. Do as you like. So long as you don't disturb my work, you can stay.  
**Nene:** Ne\~...  
**Yukari:** Hmm... Where's the list of tournament participants. From Renpu... The toji Yukina told me about would be...  
**Nene:** Ne\~ Nene\~\!  
**Yukari:** Hmm...  
**Nene:** Ne\~ Nene-ne\~\!  
**Yukari:** What? Do you want me to play with you...?  
**Yukari:** That reminds me, the institution I inspected the other day offered me wagashi... Would you like some?  
**Nene:** Ne-\! Nene-\!  
**Yukari:** Very well. I'll go get them.  
**Nene:** Ne\~\! Nene\~\!  
**Yukari:** An aradama happily eating wagashi... Really, what an odd thing you are.  
**Voice:** Oiii, Nene-\! If you're there, say something-\! Ughh, how far'd he run off to?  
**Voice:** Nene-\! We explained everything to the guards, so they won't chase you anymore-\!  
**Nene:** Ne...\!  
**Yukari:** I see, so that's what happened. You were the cause of the commotion earlier.  
**Nene:** Nene, ne-, nene-?  
**Yukari:** Hm? You're leaving already? Ahh, then you may go. But first... There is one thing I need to ask.  
**Nene:** Ne-?  
**Yukari:** By all rights, humans and aradama are incapable of coexisting. Yet, in spite of that, you've taken up as the guardian beast of the Mashiko family.  
**Yukari:** Do you feel content living alongside humans?  
**Nene:** ...Ne\~?  
**Yukari:** ......  
**Nene:** Nene\~...?  
**Yukari:** Ha...ã€€No, it wasn't a question I should have asked you, I suppose.  
**Yukari:** Leave. Do not ever return here. Do you understand?  
**Nene:** Ne-\! Nenene-\!  
**Yukari:** At the end there, was it thanking me...? Ha... What an odd thing indeed.  

## 2: Her Conviction
**Maki:** Yukari-sama, it's Shidou. I brought the documents you requested.  
**Yukari:** Enter.  
**Maki:** Right, excuse me.  
**Maki:** Here, please look over them.  
**Maki:** This is a compilation of all aradama outbreaks in recent years. And, in here is a list of all toji who enrolled in the Five Traditions this year.  
**Yukari:** Good work. I see... With this many entrants, it doesn't seem we'll have to worry about going shorthanded on toji in the near future.  
**Yukari:** However, the issue at hand isn't one of manpower, but that we lack the ability to freely increase the number of toji... Isn't that right?  
**Maki:** Yes. New okatana can be polished from Akabane swords, but the number of those we recover is never enough--  
**Maki:** --Nn?  
**Yume:** Yu\~kari-sama\~\! Let's pla... Oh, huh?  
**Yume:** Dang\~, Maki onee-san's here.  
**Maki:** Yume... From the way it sounds, you were coming to bother Yukari-sama again, weren't you?  
**Yume:** But come on, what else am I supposed to do? Besides Yukari-sama, nobody's worth fighting against.  
**Maki:** ......  
**Yukari:** Yume, I'm at work right now. Leave.  
**Yume:** Tch, that's no fun.  
**Yume:** Anyway, I'll be back later. Bye bye\~\!  
**Maki:** ......  
**Yukari:** You look discouraged, Maki. Is it because Yume doesn't acknowledge your skill with a sword?  
**Maki:** ...I believe I understand Yume's feelings towards swordfighting. I have no idea how she hides all her resolve in that small body.  
**Maki:** But, as a toji, I don't think my conviction and resolve are any weaker than hers. In spite of that, I'm still no match for Yume...  
**Yukari:** ...I see. Maki, you mentioned "conviction", but conviction is a desire to see something through.  
**Yukari:** For example, no matter how many failures it takes, you would continue pursuing your goal. That's the sort of emotion it is.  
**Yukari:** So, your conviction as a toji, what does it drive you to accomplish? To improve your skills with a sword, until there are none greater than you?  
**Maki:** Ah...  
**Maki:** No, I only want to be strong enough to protect everyone and the people close to me from the threat of aradama...\!  
**Yukari:** If that's your goal, then don't be misguided in pursuing it. Just as Yume found her strength, you have your own. That's why I entrusted you with the first seat of the elite guard.  
**Maki:** Right\! I'll take that to heart\!  
**Yukari:** Then, return to your duties. I'll examine these documents in more detail later.  
**Maki:** Understood\! I'll be going then\!  
**Yukari:** ......  
**Yukari:** (...Conviction...? How many years have I passed hanging onto that, I wonder...)  
**Yukari:** (But, even that... Will be over soon--)  

## 3: Partners in Killing Time
**Yukari:** ......Hm. It gets quiet alone in the office by myself.  
**Yukari:** Though having said that, I can't exactly take a stroll outside without purpose. Acting as the head of the Origami family can be such an inconvenient position.  
**Yukari:** ...Nn?  
**Yume:** Hellooo\~, Yu\~kari-sama\~\!  
**Yukari:** Yume...? Enter.  
**Yume:** Ah-, none of the others are in here today? Nice, lucky me-\!  
**Yukari:** ......  
**Yume:** Hey, don't worry. I didn't come to play today. I actually have something really important I wanted to tell you, Yukari-sama.  
**Yukari:** Oh...?  
**Yume:** Juuust kidding-\!  
**Yume:** Aww\~, I lost again.  
**Suzuka:** Oh? What happened, Yume?  
**Yume:** I was sure I'd be able to beat Yukari-sama today. But I screwed up.  
**Suzuka:** ...Hold it right there, Yume. You don't mean, you--  
**Suzuka:** I'm deeply sorry, Yukari-sama\! The moment I took my eyes off Yume, she came attacking you again...\!  
**Yukari:** It's fine. Pay it no mind.  
**Suzuka:** But...  
**Yukari:** In that case, will you put the room back in order after Yume made a mess of it? That may take some of the guilt off your mind.  
**Suzuka:** Yes, I'll see to it at once\!  
**Yukari:** Well done. That's enough, Suzuka.  
**Suzuka:** Understood. Um... I know this may be rude, but there's something I would like to ask.  
**Yukari:** What is it? Speak your mind.  
**Suzuka:** Why is it that you always encourage Yume by playing along with her? Surely you wouldn't allow anyone else to be so disrespectful.  
**Yukari:** Do you disapprove?  
**Suzuka:** No, that's not what I...\! Only... I was wondering, if there's some special reason why you give her such freedom...  
**Yukari:** Hm... A reason why I allow Yume freedom...?  
**Yume:** There you go again, Yukari-sama\! I thought I took you by surprise, but you blocked that so easy...\!  
**Yume:** But, I'm not done yet\!  
**Yukari:** Hm...  
**Yume:** You look like you don't even care, but...\! I can't even land a single hit\!  
**Yukari:** Are you done now, Yume?  
**Yume:** Of course not\! Let's see how you handle this-\!  
**Yume:** Hyaaahhh-\!  
**Yukari:** (Oh, she's altered her swordsmanship yet again... Intriguing.)  
**Yukari:** (In spite of the fate her body is confined to, Yume's swordsmanship remains completely unbounded...)  
**Suzuka:** Um... Yukari-sama?  
**Yukari:** It's nothing... Suzuka, to me, that is a way of killing time.  
**Yukari:** So please, leave her be. She may not seem like it, but Yume is still considerate of the proper time and place.  
**Suzuka:** ...I understand. If that's what you wish, Yukari-sama.  
**Suzuka:** With that, I'll take my leave.  
**Yukari:** (Yume's swordsmanship... That's what I feel from it-- "Freedom".)  
**Yukari:** (That... May be the reason. Why I find it so amusing to receive Yume's sword...)  

## 4: Secret Pastime
**Yomi:** I'll be going then, Yukari-sama.  
**Yukari:** This investigation into the Special Ritual Squad's equipment loss rate last year... How long do you think it will take?  
**Yomi:** The data is already roughly accumulated, so it should only take about one hour to request it from the person in charge.  
**Yukari:** Understood. I'll leave you to it.  
**Yomi:** Yes. Then, goodbye.  
**Yukari:** ...Is she gone? Then...  
**Yukari:** Let's get to this at once. I should still have some in stock... ...Hm, there they are.  
**Yukari:** I have to open a window before anything else. Some ventilation is essential, so... There.  
**Yukari:** Now-- Time to begin.  
**Yukari:** Add the seasoning, then pour in hot water for 3 minutes. After that, remove the water and mix in the sauce. I see, fairly standard... This cup yakisoba.  
**Yukari:** Last time 4 minutes passed without me noticing, and the noodles had hardly any stiffness. Though, I didn't dislike it...  
**Yukari:** This vinyl cover... I can leave it in the drawer for now and dispose of it later.  
**Yukari:** (If it were ever found out that the favorite food of the head of the Origami family was instant cup yakisoba-- All the dignity with which I've established myself until now could crumble...)  
**Yukari:** (People will not follow strength alone.)  
**Yukari:** (Dignity, formality, charisma... All accomplish nothing more than creating an impression, however they are indispensable to leading an organization.)  
**Yukari:** (It goes without saying that this must be kept hidden from Maki and Suzuka, Yume of course, and even Yomi.)  
**Yukari:** However, it's a real oddity... Cup yakisoba. It seems like every night I feel the urge to eat some... In spite of its crudeness...  
**Yukari:** No, but then again, maybe I should consider it from the perspective of a simple provision. All it requires is hot water, and with only 3 minutes needed to prepare... I cannot disrespect this-- This example of human ingenuity.  
**Yukari:** Those 3 minutes should have passed by now. Hm... That's quite a good scent.  
**Yukari:** (Slurp, slurrp...)  
**Yomi:** I've returned, Yukari-sama. Here is the data you requested.  
**Yukari:** Good, sorry to trouble you.  
**Yomi:** No...  
**Yomi:** ...? Um, Yukari-sama.  
**Yukari:** What is it?  
**Yomi:** Did you open a window? The room's temperature seems different from before I left.  
**Yukari:** ......  
**Yukari:** I thought a little ventilation would help clear my mind. What of it?  
**Yomi:** I just wondered if the air conditioning might be malfunctioning. I didn't mean to question you...  
**Yukari:** You don't need to concern yourself with that. I'm not a flower in a greenhouse.  
**Yomi:** Yes ma'am, I'll keep that in mind.  
**Yukari:** That's enough for today, Yomi. Return to the dormitory and rest.  
**Yomi:** Understood. Then, I'll take my leave.  
**Yukari:** ..................Hm. The position of the head of the Origami household needs consideration as well.  
**Yomi:** (......)  
**Yomi:** (What was that small stain on Yukari-sama's clothing...? It wasn't there an hour ago...)  
**Yomi:** (Soy sauce...? Or some other sauce...?)  
**Maki:** What's wrong, Yomi? Is something on your mind?  
**Yomi:** ......  
**Suzuka:** Yomi?  
**Yomi:** ......No, it's nothing.  
**Yomi:** Yukari-sama ordered me to rest, so will one of you please take over for me?  

## 5: Remnant of the Past
**Maki:** Are you sure about this, Yukari-sama?  
**Yukari:** Yes, I don't mind.  
**Suzuka:** Please, wait. Even for practice, four against one is too much...  
**Yume:** But what's wrong with that-? Yukari-sama's the one saying we can do it. Right? Yomi onee-san.  
**Yomi:** If that's what she orders, I'll go along with it.  
**Suzuka:** Still...  
**Yukari:** Suzuka... Surely you don't mean you're worried about me?  
**Yukari:** If so-- Are you that incapable of judging your opponent's strength; is that what you are saying?  
**Suzuka:** ...\!  
**Maki:** Suzuka... I think you're getting needlessly worried. Even against a group, Yukari-sama's skills should be far greater than our own.  
**Maki:** And in that case... We should test ourselves against them. To find out just how we stack up to Yukari-sama. Isn't this a good opportunity to know more about ourselves?  
**Suzuka:** Fu... That's very like you, Maki-san.  
**Yume:** Hey, hey, let's get going already-.  
**Yomi:** Shidou-san, do you have a plan?  
**Maki:** I don't. Only to show the results of our daily training.  
**Yukari:** ...Then let's begin. All of you, come at me with everything you can manage.  
**Yukari:** What's the matter? Are you finished?  
**Suzuka:** Pant, pant... Even with the four of us, we can't keep up after all...\!  
**Maki:** That's the might of Origami Yukari...\!  
**Yume:** What are you giving up for already, let's keep going-\!  
**Yukari:** Fu...  
**Suzuka:** Yomi, let's rush her together\!  
**Yomi:** Understood.  
**Suzuka:** Kh... Maki-san\! You're next\!  
**Maki:** Haaaaaahh-\!\!\!  
**Yukari:** (All members, consecutively attacking from Yume's starting point... To be able to coordinate to this degree without any prior signal; strong movements like these do justice to the name of elite guard...)  
**Yukari:** (Fu, it reminds me, the Special Task Team was like that as well...)  
**Yukari:** (Those who once fought at my side. Souraku Yuzuki, Takatsu Yukina, Hashima Ema, Gojou Iroha, Maniwa Sana-- As well as Hiiragi Kagari and Fujiwara Minato...)  
**Yukari:** (Thinking back on it, despite all our differences in temperament and fighting style, it was impressive how well we were able to match each other's movements...)  
**Yukari:** (Has it really been twenty years...? Kagari and Minato are gone, and time has taken its toll on the others. Yet, I still...)  
**Maki:** Gh... Gah...\!  
**Suzuka:** Maki-san\!\?  
**Maki:** Kh... I-I can still...\!  
**Yukari:** ...That's enough. Sheath your okatana. Training is over.  
**Yume:** Pant, pant, pant... I-I'm, still, ready to fight, though...?  
**Yomi:** Tsubakuro-san. Catch your breath.  
**Yume:** Ughh... Grrrr...\!  
**Yukari:** Relax, Yume. I'll provide you more opportunities.  
**Yukari:** Maki, Suzuka, and Yomi all showed good coordination as well. Though there's room for improvement in your teamwork.  
**Maki:** ...I understand. But next time, I'll show you how much closer I can reach to you...\!  
**Yukari:** Good, do not forget that feeling.  
**Yukari:** Those who cannot recognize their inexperience, have no room to grow from it...

## [Renpu High: Start]: Marshmallows
**Minato:** Yukari, Kagari, morning-\!  
**Yukari:** Morning, Minato.  
**Kagari:** Good morning.  
**Minato:** You gotta hear this\! Last night, I had this awesome dream-\! In my dream, we were all a part of the tournament...  
**Minato:** But the white gravel at the tournament grounds had all turned into marshmallows, so we couldn't do it, and then we just decided to eat them all\!  
**Kagari:** Sigh... I shouldn't be surprised, Minato-senpai. Even your dreams don't make any sense...  
**Minato:** I mean, it was such a crazy dream that I felt like I had to tell you as soon as possible\! You know how it is, right? Hey, Yukari, what kinda dream did you have last night?  
**Yukari:** My dream last night... I think I had one...  
**Yukari:** Ah...\!  
**Kagari:** Yukari-sama? What is it?  
**Yukari:** It's nothing. Look, school is starting. Let's go to our classrooms.  
**Minato:** What that was about. Yukari was acting a little weird, wasn't she?  
**Kagari:** Was she? Anyway, if we don't hurry, we'll be late. Really now, this is all your fault for launching into some long and pointless story about your dreams, Minato-senpai...  
**Minato:** Sorry about that. But still, wouldn't it be funny if that dream ended up coming true\~?  
In a break between classes.

  
**Minato:** Ah\~, I'm starving. I can't believe it's still only 2nd period.  
**Yukari:** Minato. So you were over here.  
**Minato:** Yeah, I was hungry, so I thought I'd buy some bread from the school store. Why're you here, Yukari?  
**Yukari:** No reason, really. We have music class next, don't we? Let's go together.  
**Minato:** O-Okay...  
After school that day.

  
**Minato:** Ah\~, I can't be bothered today, so maybe I'll skip practice and take an afternoon nap.  
**Yukari:** Minato, you came out here to skip practice again...  
**Minato:** Sorry about that, Yukari. I'll try extra hard in practice starting tomorrow, so give everyone my regards\~\!  
**Yukari:** Wait. If you won't be coming to practice, I'll do self-training at my household too, so let's leave together.  
**Minato:** Eh-- You will\!\?  
**Kagari:** What's going on, Yukari-sama? You're skipping practice along with Minato-senpai?  
**Yukari:** There's no real reason for it. I just thought it would be nice for us to walk home together for once. Come on, Kagari, Minato. Let's go.  
**Kagari:** There's something strange about Yukari-sama today, isn't there?  
**Minato:** That's what I'm saying. It always feels like I'm the one sticking close to Yukari, but today it's like it's the other way around... I wonder what happened... Nn-, I wanna know\!  

## [Renpu High: End]: Dream Come True
**Minato:** Ahh\~, the three of us skipping practice and going home together feels all fresh and exciting\! Want to stop by somewhere?  
**Kagari:** Yukari-sama and I will be practicing as soon as we return to the Origami household. Please don't treat us like your accomplices, Minato-senpai.  
**Minato:** Come on, don't be such a stick in the mud\~. We never go home early together\! There's this super cool secret spot I found that I'll show you.  
**Yukari:** Secret spot? And where is that?  
**Minato:** You'll have to wait and see. C'mon, let's go\!  
**Minato:** You two are so slow\~. If you keep it up, the sun's gonna go down\~\!  
**Kagari:** Pant, pant. You're taking us up quite the mountain trail.  
**Yukari:** Minato, can't we leave it at this and go home for today? I have a strange feeling about this.  
**Minato:** Hey, Yukari, what's this feeling about anyway? You've been acting kinda weird since this morning. Come on and tell us.  
**Yukari:** ...  
**Minato:** If you just explain things, I'll hear you out, okay?  
**Yukari:** I might just be getting afraid over nothing, but, this morning, I had a strange dream.  
**Yukari:** Up in a mountain, there was this mysterious shrine I had never seen before. You went running up the steps to it, Minato... And then, the moment I took my eyes off you, you vanished.  
**Kagari:** As in... She was spirited away?  
**Yukari:** I can't say that for sure, but I woke up with this feeling of unease, and it's worrying me.  
**Minato:** Alright, I get it now\! It's true that, unlike my dream, this one sounds like it could actually happen.  
**Kagari:** Minato-senpai, given what Yukari-sama is saying, can we not stop here today and go back?  
**Minato:** Hmm, you have a point. If Yukari's that sure about it...   
**Minato:** I know\! Won't everything be fine if I just don't go on ahead like I did in Yukari's dream?  
**Minato:** I'll stay right with you every step of the way, alright? Since we already came this far, you'll definitely be missing out if you don't see it now\! Okay?  
**Yukari:** If you insist, Minato... Fine then, let's go see.  
**Minato:** You've got to\! Don't worry; so long as the three of us are together, no matter where we go, we'll make it through\!  
**Minato:** Okaaay, here we are\!  
**Yukari:** This is...  
**Kagari:** I didn't think cherry blossoms could still be in bloom somewhere at this time of season...  
**Minato:** This place is hidden away on the north side of the mountain, so it doesn't get much sun, which means the cherry blossoms bloom later than usual.  
**Yukari:** I'm surprised you managed to find a place like this.  
**Minato:** I saw it in a dream I had. There were all these cherry blossoms blooming on the north side of a mountain. So I got interested, and when I came to check it out, I found this\!  
**Kagari:** You mean, your dream came true then?  
**Minato:** Yep. If Yukari's dream came true, that'd be scary, but I'm glad a fun dream like this one was real\!  
**Yukari:** That's for sure. I hope we can be spared Minato getting spirited away or the gravel turning to marshmallows, but I'm very glad to see a dream like this come true.

## [Dress '20 - Yukari: Start]: Recognition Party Put in Motion
**Yume:** I wanna have a party\!  
**Yukari:** A party?  
**Maki:** Where's this coming from all of a sudden, Yume?  
**Yume:** The onee-sans who were in the Miss Five Traditions contest are all getting together for a party\!  
**Yume:** So we should do it too\!  
**Suzuka:** If that's what you meant, then I've heard about it as well.  
**Suzuka:** Though, it seemed to be more of a recognition party than a simple gathering.  
**Yukari:** A recognition party? If that's how it is, I should be the one to host it.  
**Maki:** You'll host it, Yukari-sama?  
**Yukari:** Miss Five Traditions was something I carried out. Which should make a recognition party my responsibility.  
**Suzuka:** In that case, I'll make arrangements for the location.  
**Yukari:** Please do.  
**Yomi:** Then, I'll take care of the food.  
**Yukari:** Right.  
**Maki:** Yume and I will do something to cover for our regular duties.  
**Yume:** If we're suppressing aradama, just leave it to me.  
**Yukari:** Then, I'm depending on you.  
**Elite Guard:** Yes ma'am\!  
**Sana:** You're doing a recognition party?  
**Yukari:** I've already told Ema and the others. Could you fit it in your schedules, Sana, Yuzuki?  
**Yuzuki:** That's fine with me, but, isn't this party for the girls who appeared in Miss Five Traditions?  
**Yuzuki:** Wouldn't it be better to keep ourselves out of the way?  
**Sana:** I can imagine Kaoru wouldn't be too happy about it.  
**Yukari:** I'd like to keep it private, but, if I'm the one to host it, that won't be possible.  
**Yukari:** Everyone involved in Miss Five Traditions will be invited too.  
**Yuzuki:** ...So that's how it is.  
**Yukari:** I want you two to handle things on that end.  
**Sana:** So you want the toji kept free of any unnecessary hassling.  
**Yuzuki:** It's bound to happen.  
**Yukari:** Then, I'm relying on you for the day of.  

## [Dress '20 - Yukari: End]: Recognition Party
**Maki:** Yukari-sama, we've finished organizing the tables.  
**Yukari:** And the food?  
**Yomi:** There are no issues.  
**Suzuka:** Right now, they're setting drinks at the tables.  
**Yukari:** I see.  
**Yume:** I drank a little bit of it, and it was really tasty.  
**Suzuka:** Oh my, where are your manners?  
**Yume:** It was just a little bit though?  
**Yukari:** You've done well. You should all get changed too.  
**Maki:** Yes ma'am.  
**Yume:** I can't wait to see our dresses\!  
**Suzuka:** I'll help pick out accessories for you.  
**Yume:** Great-\!  
**Yomi:** Konohana-san, could you help me too?  
**Suzuka:** Very well. And of course, you'd like me to coordinate your outfit as well, Maki-san?  
**Maki:** Sure; I'd appreciate it, Suzuka.  
**Yuzuki:** How is everything coming along?  
**Yukari:** Yuzuki. Nothing's come up; it's all going smoothly.  
**Sana:** I passed by Ellen earlier. You got some good dresses ready for them, Yukari-senpai.  
**Yukari:** Only what seemed appropriate.  
**Sana:** There's a gathering starting to form by now.  
**Yuzuki:** We should say our hellos.  
**Sana:** What about you, Yukari-senpai?  
**Yukari:** I think I'll join you.  
**Mihono:** Yukari-sama\!  
**Yukari:** Asakura Mihono.  
**Mihono:** Thanks so much for today\!  
**Mihono:** You threw this party because I said I wanted to do a thank you party... didn't you?  
**Yukari:** It's nothing you should concern yourself over.  
**Yukari:** From the start, I was the one who prepared the Miss Five Traditions contest. If there was going to be a recognition party, I should be the one in charge of it.  
**Mihono:** At first, I was thinking, let's all go do karaoke\! But, seeing it turn into such a big party is really surprising.  
**Yukari:** Did I spoil your plans?  
**Mihono:** Not at all\! Actually, I'm really excited to see what kind of food they bring out and stuff\!  
**Yukari:** You girls are the stars of this party. You should enjoy it to your heart's content.  
**Mihono:** I will\!
