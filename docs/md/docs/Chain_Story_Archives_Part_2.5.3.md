## 7: Inago Akira, the Toji
**Mihono:** This is the third time we've gone in, isn't it?  
**Yui:** At this point, it's hard not to feel a little exhausted.  
**Akira:** Oi, no losing focus.  
**Mihono/Yui:** Right\!  
**Hana:** She looks okay now, but... Yui's stamina might be reaching its limit.  
**Akira:** Doesn't that go for you too? Your swings are losing their sharpness.  
**Hana:** ...You could tell?  
**Akira:** How could I not?  
**Akira:** You ready? This is the last insertion. We're too late in the game for somebody to get seriously hurt here.  
**Hana:** ...I know.  
**Akira:** But still, don't go complaining. We're not about to leave a single person behind either.  
**Hana:** Right\!  
**Mihono:** Hmm, there's nobody around here.  
**Yui:** It'd be a lot easier to search for people if we could shout for them, but then the aradama would come running...  
**Hana:** We're just going to have to search place by place as we go.  
**Yui:** Pant, pant...  
**Mihono:** Are you okay?  
**Yui:** Fine, just fine, I'm just so happy, surrounded by all these cuties.  
**Hana:** If she can joke around like that, she must be fine.  
**Akira:** ...Shut up for a second.  
**Mihono/Yui:** I-I'm sorry\!  
**Akira:** Just shut up\!  
**All Three:** ......  
**Akira:** ......  
**Akira:** I knew I heard something.  
**Hana:** Heard what?  
**???:** ......dy.  
**Mihono:** Ah, someone's saying something\!  
**Yui:** Over that way\!  
**Boy:** Ah... Some toji ladies...  
**Hana:** You were hiding in here?  
**Yui:** It's easy to overlook, isn't it.  
**Akira:** Damnit, why don't you pick somewhere easier to find.  
**Boy:** Eep...  
**Akira:** Huhh?  
**Boy:** UWAAAAAHHHHH\!  
**Yui:** Boss made him cry\!  
**Akira:** C'mon, if you're a man, then quit crying.  
**Boy:** B-Buttt...  
**Akira:** You managed to hold out on your own for this long, didn't you?  
**Boy:** Y-Yeah.  
**Akira:** Then, quit crying. You'll never keep anybody safe if you're crying all the time.  
**Boy:** ......Okay\!  
**Akira:** Good, 'atta boy\!  
**Mihono:** He stopped crying...  
**Yui:** That's why she's the boss\!  
**Hana:** Does that have anything to do with it?  
**Akira:** Alright, Mihono\! You're in charge of this brat\!  
**Mihono:** Eh?  
**Akira:** He was crying up a storm.  
**Akira:** 'Course it was gonna attract aradama.  
**Boy:** It's my fault...  
**Akira:** Don't start crying\! ...Just wait there\!  
**Boy:** ...\!  
**Akira:** Good boy; like that. Just leave all this... to me\!  
**Akira:** ORAA\!  
**Mihono:** Wow... Ow, hey, you're grabbing on too hard...  
**Boy:** ...  
**Mihono:** (He's watching her so seriously now... Even though he was crying before...)  
**Boy:** You can do it, toji lady\!  
**Mihono:** (To this kid, Akira-san must look like a hero... She is pretty cool, isn't she.)  

## 8: Self-Consciousness and Determination
**Toji:** You can leave that boy with me.  
**Akira:** Counting on you.  
**Akira:** So long, brat\! You be good\!  
**Boy:** Thank you, toji lady\!  
**Akira:** Yeah, take care.  
**Akira:** 'kay, he should be fine from here. Let's put in some effort and check the rest out.  
**All Three:** Yeah...  
**Akira:** Guess it's about time we took a break. You've all gotta be at your limit, right?  
**Hana:** I am...  
**Yui:** That's our boss... You can tell it all...  
**Mihono:** Yeah, the usual missions are tough, but... This is on a whole different level.  
**Yui:** That's cause it isn't so easy as just coming out here, beating all the aradama, and everything's okay.  
**Mihono:** From now on... There's going to be a lot more disasters like this happening, won't there.  
**Mihono:** And... A lot more people will get hurt...  
**Hana:** That's what we're here for; to save as many of those people as we can.  
**Mihono:** That's true...  
**Akira:** Is something on your mind?  
**Akira:** Go ahead and let me know then. I've always got time to give a kouhai some advice.  
**Mihono:** I always have this feeling like, I've gotta do something, but I'm not sure what it is I should be doing...  
**Akira:** ...Ahh, I think I get it. A buddy of mine, they've got the same kind of worries.  
**Akira:** I don't know if it's exactly the same, but you're wanting to change yourself, right?  
**Mihono:** I guess I want to change?  
**Akira:** Yeah. That's mostly how it is for them. Wanting to get tougher.  
**Mihono:** -\!\? I think you might be right\!  
**Akira:** In that case, you've got to challenge yourself. Do whatever's toughest, cause that's what's best for you.  
**Hana:** (...Inago-san, she seems like the type who's good at looking after others. Calling her boss wasn't too far off the mark.)  
**Mihono:** Whatever's toughest... Maybe I will transfer to the police.  
**Yui:** You mean it\!\?  
**Yui:** Between Hana-san and Mihono-chan, I'd have a pretty girl whichever way I look\!  
**Akira:** Dumbass\! Don't drop your guard\!   
**Yui:** Eh?  
**Aradama:** UUUOOOOOOOOO\!\!  
**Yui:** Gah\!  
**Akira:** Mihono, Hana, get your utsushi up\!  
**Mihono:** On it\!  
**Hana:** Kh...\!\? I can't...\!  
**Aradama:** GAAAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Hana:** Ggh-\!  
**Akira:** Tch, you're both at your limit then... Oi\! If you're still breathing, then say something\!  
**Yui:** I'm hurting, but, I'm fine...  
**Hana:** Same here... But, I don't think I can fight any more.  
**Akira:** HAAAAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Akira:** Don't sweat it\! I'm not letting you two get hurt again\!  
**Yui:** Boss...  
**Akira:** Mihono\!  
**Mihono:** Y-Yes\!  
**Akira:** You get it now, right? What a toji needs is strength\!  
**Mihono:** ...Right\!  
**Akira:** Now, do what I tell you\! We're not gonna let the aradama come near Hana or Yui anymore\!  
**Akira:** Push out, and stop that aradama coming for us\!  
**Mihono:** YAAH\!  
**Aradama:** OOOUUUUU\!\!  
**Mihono:** Urgh...\! I managed to stop it, somehow, but...\!\! Akira-san, I can't hold it off\!  
**Akira:** That's plenty; you did good, Mihono.  
**Mihono:** Ah...  
**Mihono:** (Akira-san, she really is strong... I'm... nowhere near that.)  
**Akira:** ORAORAORA\! Let's keep it going\!  
**Mihono:** (...I do want to get stronger.)  

## 9: The Next Step
**Mai:** HAAAAAAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Sawano:** With that, nearly all the aradama in the area should be suppressed now.  
**Sawano:** You were working hard, Yanase-san.  
**Mai:** Yes, you too.  
**Mai:** Um... Fukuda-san, do you know where it was that Mihono-chan went to fight?  
**Sawano:** If I remember... She should be at the shopping mall.  
**Mai:** The shopping mall...  
**Sawano:** You can go if you want. I can take care of the rest here.  
**Mai:** Thank you very much\!  
**Mai:** Mihono-chan\!  
**Mihono:** Ah, Mai\!  
**Futaba:** Hey, Mihono\! Since when did you become friends with Yanase-san?  
**Mihono:** Uhh, a little while ago?  
**Mai:** ...I'm glad you're safe, Mihono-chan. I heard lots of people were getting injured, and it made me worried.  
**Mihono:** Yeah, I'm just fine, but...  
**Mai:** But?  
**Hana:** They seriously did a number on the both of us.  
**Mai:** Suzumoto-san, and Yamashiro-san too\!\? Are you two okay...?  
**Hana:** Doesn't feel like I'm doing that great.  
	[ambulance siren]

  
**Yui:** Ah, sounds like our ride is here, Hana-san.  
**Hana:** That's our ride...?  
**Yui:** Seeya around, Mihono-chan\! If you have the time to pay us a visit, you'll make my day\! Okay\!  
**Mai:** She really wanted to make a point of that while they carried her off...  
**Mihono:** That's Yui for you\!  
**Futaba:** Anyway, Mihono, since when did you become friends with girls from Ayanokouji?  
**Mihono:** Umm, a little while ago?  
**Futaba:** You just keep saying that\!  
**Mihono:** Excuse me.  
**Ema:** Asakura-san? Thank you, for your efforts the other day. What did you need?  
**Mihono:** Err... About what you said, about transferring to a unit under the MPD's command, can I still do that\!\?  
**Ema:** Of course, that would be fine, though... Did something happen?  
**Mihono:** Yeah. I talked to Yui and Suzumoto-san, and Akira-san gave me advice... I made up my mind.  
**Ema:** It sounds like you got the encouragement you needed.  
**Ema:** I understand. In that case, starting today, you'll be transferred to the Metropolitan Police Department.  
**Mihono:** Starting today\!\?  
**Ema:** Yes. Ever since you asked to be sent to the mall, I've been expecting this to come.  
**Ema:** The preparations were taken care of.  
**Mihono:** Uwah... Is it really that easy to tell what I'm going to do?  
**Ema:** I've seen a lot of girls like you, Asakura-san. For all of them, working with the MPD was a good experience.  
**Ema:** I hope the same will be true for you, Asakura-san.  
**Mihono:** ...Okay\! I'm going then\!  
**Mihono:** Hey, is Inago Akira-san here?  
**Sawano:** If you're looking for Inago-san, she isn't here yet...  
**Mihono:** Do you know how soon she'll be here?  
**Sawano:** Hmmm, I'm not sure? There are plenty of times Inago-san doesn't even come to school...  
**Mihono:** Oh, okay...  
**Mihono:** (I wanted to thank her about what happened before school started...)  
**Mihono:** (But I guess Akira-san's a delinquent after all.)  
**Akira:** Hello?  
**Akira:** Yeah, sorry. It wasn't in the plan, but I made contact with her.  
**Akira:** Mm... Yeah. There's no signs of her awakening yet.  
**Akira:** I think it's probably gonna take a bit more time.  
**Akira:** Yeah, got it. I'll keep on watching Asakura Mihono.
