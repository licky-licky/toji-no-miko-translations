**Countdown:** Sleepover Part 1  
**Mitsui Honoka:** I can't wait for tomorrow's girls' night.  
**Saegusa Mayumi:** Sorry, for springing it on you so suddenly. Ordinarily, I would have wanted Mari and A-chan to come too.  
**Kitayama Shizuku:** We don't get school trips at Magic High, so it does get hard for us to stay the night anywhere outside of chances like this.  
**Angelina:** They really make the school curriculum packed, don't they.  
**Chiba Erika:** Yeah they do. That's why you shouldn't let it get to you, senpai.  
**Shizuku:** You would have preferred it if Tatsuya could come along, wouldn't you, Miyuki?  
**Shiba Miyuki:** Going on a trip together with Onii-sama would be all I could ask for, but I'm sure that's not what Saegusa-senpai had in mind.  
**Miyuki:** And, when I told Onii-sama about this, he said not to mind him and enjoy myself.  
**Erika:** Tatsuya-kun seems like he'd come running in an instant if anything went wrong anyway-.  
**Miyuki:** Yes, that's how Onii-sama is. Though, we should try to avoid letting anything that worrisome happen.  
**Mayumi:** I'm so glad that you're all looking forward to it. Ah, if any of you can't sleep with a different pillow, don't forget to bring your own.

**Countdown:** Sleepover Part 2  
**Honoka:** Oh right, Shizuku. You said before you were looking something up to prepare for tonight; what was it?  
**Shizuku:** It's almost summer, so I was thinking we could tell scary stories.  
**Honoka:** We finally get the chance to stay the night together, so I think it'd be better to talk about something else... Something besides scary stories\!  
**Miyuki:** What sort of conversations would be appropriate for this then?  
**Mayumi:** Talking about romance, right?  
**Erika:** Is there someone you're interested in, Saegusa-senpai?  
**Mayumi:** That stays a secret\~.  
**Shizuku:** I have a feeling Honoka's gaining more rivals.  
**Honoka:** Hey, Shizuku\! Just because Tatsuya-san's so charming doesn't make us rivals...  
**Angelina:** You really do like Tatsuya, huh Honoka.  
**Mayumi:** Fufu, you'll have to tell us all about it tonight, okay?  
**Honoka:** Auuu\~...  
**Miyuki:** By the way, what scary stories did you find, Shizuku?  
**Shizuku:** What's been popular lately aren't really scary stories, but strange stories. Whether or not it really happened, there's stories of people suddenly going to a parallel world.  
**Erika:** Those are nothing more than people just making stuff up.  
**Miyuki:** Though, they do sound interesting. If you'd like, you can tell me about it later.  
**Shizuku:** I wasn't expecting you to be interested, but alright. Wait till tonight.  

## 1: The Ultimate Image Training
**Mihono:** Hey, Fukki. Do you know anything about this new training Tsugumi-san told us about?  
**Kofuki:** Like I'd know. I only just heard we were doing training today.  
**Mirja:** It seems we'll be testing a new training method. I was told we would learn the details once we arrive at the lab.  
**Kiyoka:** By the way, Chie-san. Didn't you say you had something you needed to take care of after this?  
**Chie:** I do. If the training takes more than a few hours, then I think I'll only stand in and watch.  
**Chie:** Though, I don't mean to dissapoint Tsugumi-chan...  
**Yui:** I think I heard there'll be people there besides the investigation team, so I'm sure it'll be alright, Chie-san.  
**Yui:** What matters most is it'll be stacked with girls\!  
**Mirja:** ...We should hurry.  
**Kanami:** Ah, Mihono-chan\!  
**Mihono:** So when they said there'd be people besides us, it was Kanami and Hiyori.  
**Yume:** We're here too though-.  
**Mirja:** I see. With this many people assembled, it should be a full-fledged test.  
**Tsugumi:** Everyone. I see you're all here. Thank you very much for coming.  
**Tsugumi:** Now, I'll get straight to the point. Speaking from what we would like to achieve, we are looking for a means of utilizing dreams for training purposes.  
**Mihono:** By dreams, you mean like what we see while we're sleeping?  
**Tsugumi:** Yes. Our chief objective is to carry out the ultimate image training efficiently through dreams while sleeping.  
**Tsugumi:** It may sound dubious, but there are hypotheses and examples pointing to the link between experiences while dreaming and actual improvement of ability in the field of sports.  
**Tsugumi:** During this test, I will have you at least sleep for a period of several hours.  
**Suzuka:** So this is an experiment to determine if holding onto the image of "doing" from within a dream can lead to improvement of actual technique.  
**Tsugumi:** That's it exactly. What's most important is that you form the strongest... The greatest image of yourself.  
**Kanami:** Training in your dreams\! I think I might be really good at that\!  
**Mihono:** If it's in a dream, you'd be able to do all kinds of crazy stuff\!  
**Hiyori:** But, will you really be able to do it that easily?  
**Tsugumi:** I will be giving each of you strong support so you can have the experience you want to see while sleeping.  
**Tsugumi:** As for what your dream will be like... Please form a concrete image of your ideal self.  
**Kiyoka:** Our ideal self... It's a little hard to, when you ask us all of a sudden.  
**Tsugumi:** Well, so long as we can collect a variety of samples this time, that will be enough. It's not an issue if you're unable to see exactly the dreams you want, so I would appreciate it if you simply participated.  
**Yui:** It's alright\! I'll think up the ideal Kiyoka-chan for you\!  
**Kiyoka:** That's not alright at all, Yui-chan... Don't think up anything weird, okay?  
**Mihono:** Hmmm... What would be good? I guess I want to be strong at least.  
**Yume:** I'm already strong, so I'd want something else-.  
**Yume:** Instead of my ideal self or whatever, since we'll be dreaming, don't you want to try using magic and stuff?  
**Kanami:** Since we're dreaming, I bet we could\!  
**Mihono:** That'll be fun for sure\! Fire and ice magic are pretty cliched, but I still wanna do them\!  
**Yume:** I know, right\! I wanna try flying too\!  
**Maki:** Magic is definitely out of the question here...  
**Mirja:** Dreams... It may depend on your power of imagination, but, if you aren't able to build from that experience in the real world, it wouldn't be suitable for use as training...  
**Yume:** Geez, why do you onee-sans have to make it so boring?  
**Tsugumi:** Well-, I wasn't expecting magic either, but I think it could possibly work?  
**Tsugumi:** Though, it doesn't suit the purpose of today's test. This is ultimately a form of training for toji.  
**Kanami:** Right, yeah... Ahaha.  
**Yomi:** Our ideal self as a toji... That might be a little difficult to imagine. Though, it isn't as if I don't have a strength that I idealize.  
**Suzuka:** Desires are something that will differ from person to person.  
**Suzuka:** But many toji would dream of suppressing aradama while keeping casualties to a minimum, or consider it their ideal.  
**Suzuka:** Though, wishing all the aradama were gone might be the most common.  
**Kofuki:** Count me out if all the aradama-chan are gone.  
**Kiyoka:** Ah, where are you going, Kofuki-san\!\?  
**Kofuki:** I'm not interested in training where there's no aradama-chan.  
**Tsugumi:** Don't worry. Shichinosato-san not participating was well within my expectations.  
**Chie:** I have to take care of something later too, so I won't be able to participate in the training itself.  
**Chie:** If there's anything I can help with instead, feel free to let me know.  
**Tsugumi:** I would appreciate it. Then, those of you who will be participating, please come with me. We'll provide a comfortable environment for sleeping.  
**Tsugumi:** Please strongly visualize your ideal self. Do your best not to forget it.  
**Tsugumi:** Now then, everyone, pleasant dreams--  
**Mihono:** Tsugumi-san's training was over before you know it, but I feel like, right now, I can concentrate really hard on missions\!  
**Mirja:** This may be an especially effective training method for you, Asakura Mihono.  
**Yui:** Since my okatana is an odachi, I thought I'd like to be able to decide things in a single hit when it counts, but that means I'll have to work on my actual ability to read a situation.  
**Yui:** Since I realized that at least, does that mean the training worked?  
**Kiyoka:** Yui-chan's... getting very serious.  
**Yui:** I am serious-. Since toji are girls, I've gotta protect them no matter what\!  
**Hiyori:** What did you end up thinking about, Kanami?  
**Kanami:** You know, I get the feeling that I dreamed about fighting in a match against you and Yume-chan. You were both really strong\!  
**Kanami:** And fighting tough opponents is the best training after all, so I might've gotten closer to my ideal.  
**Hiyori:** ......  
**Hiyori:** Well, that might be one way to do it. Which means it might not be bad using that dream for training.  
**Kanami:** Yeah\!  
**Mihono:** Ahaha, even in her dreams, Kanami still acts like Kanami-.  
**Mirja:** One step at a time, we can only work toward our goals through effort. Holding onto a firm image will be a good experience--  
**Kiyoka:** Aradama\!\?  
**Mirja:** A message came in... It seems we've been given orders to move out.  
**Mirja:** We'll hurry to the scene immediately\!  
**Aradama:** GGGGGIIIII...\!  
**Chiba Erika:** Come on already\! What's with... these things\!\? This whole time... there's just no end to them\!  
**Shiba Miyuki:** Erika, complaining won't do any good. We may not be sure of what these strange things are, but we can't leave them here.  
**Miyuki:** --HAAAH\!  
**Erika:** Thanks, Miyuki\! If they're like this--  
**Kitayama Shizuku:** Miyuki's cooling magic stopped the monsters here from moving.  
**Mitsui Honoka:** Thank goodness... Now we can catch our breath.  
**Saegusa Mayumi:** Still, what are these monstrous looking things in the first place...?  
**Angelina:**  Wait... Something's not right\! No way; Miyuki's magic isn't working...?  
**Aradama:** ...UUUUU\!  
**Yui:** It looks like there's some extra cute cuties fighting for some reason\!\?  
**Mihono:** Eh; you're right\!\?  
**Kanami:** We've gotta help them\!  

## 2: Strange Visitors
**Miyuki:** Thank you very much for your assistance.  
**Hiyori:** No, you don't need to thank us. Suppressing aradama is our duty.  
**Shizuku:** So those monster looking things are called aradama.  
**Erika:** What's the deal with our attacks not having any effect on them, anyway?  
**Kanami:** Only a toji carrying an okatana can exorcise an aradama.  
**Erika:** Ehh... What's with that? Is that a thing?  
**Mayumi:** So that would be why Miyuki-san's magic didn't do any more than hold them still...  
**Mihono:** ...M-Magic\!\? Can you really use magic\!\?  
**Honoka:** Ah, we can. We're students of Magic High School.  
**Kiyoka:** ...Magic... high school?  
**Angelina:** It looks like... We both have lots of things we don't know about each other.  
**Mirja:** Yes. That seems to be the case. I'd like to provide a better place for us to talk over the situation, so will you come with us?  
**Mayumi:** We understand. Lead the way.  
**Mayumi:** Then, summing it up, these aradama aren't only the ones from earlier, but something like a natural disaster which appears frequently...  
**Mayumi:** The ones specialized to combat them are toji like yourselves, and people have been aware of both aradama and toji long throughout history.  
**Shizuku:** ...Though, neither of them are common knowledge to us.  
**Honoka:** Yeah... But, why though... Maybe if we had Tatsuya-san here with us...  
**Miyuki:** That's right. I'm sure that, if Onii-sama were with us, he would diminish the unease we feel now.  
**Miyuki:** But, Onii-sama isn't here.  
**Miyuki:** Which is why we need to do all we can to return to the world with Onii-sama in it.  
**Mayumi:** Miyuki-san has the right idea. Mm, it would be bad for us to lose hope here.  
**Angelina:** Well, knowing Tatsuya, he'll figure something out as soon as he learns something happened to Miyuki.  
**Erika:** Ah, he totally would\! Tatsuya-kun's a real siscon, after all-.  
**Miyuki:** Honestly... I don't need to hear that from you, Erika, Lina... Let's leave the talk about Onii-sama at that.  
**Miyuki:** Otherwise, we'd be inconveniencing everyone. They made time to meet with us here, after all.  
**Kanami:** It sounds like your brother is really something else, uh, Miyuki-san?  
**Miyuki:** Yes, I'm very proud of him. Ah... I'm sorry. Please, continue what you were saying.  
**Yui:** I know, I know\! Mirja-san, I have a suggestion to make-\!  
**Mirja:** And what is that, Yamashiro Yui.  
**Yui:** Shouldn't we introduce ourselves around now? It's awkward not knowing each other's names.  
**Erika:** I'm on board with that\! My name's Chiba Erika. It looks like we'll be in your care for a while, so treat us well\~.  
**Yui:** Pleased to meet you, Erika-san\! I'm Yamashiro Yui\!  
**Mihono:** I'm Asakura Mihono.  
**Mihono:** You might be worried, but I'm sure we can get a place to stay and stuff for you, so don't worry about it\!  
**Mihono:** ...Right?  
**Mirja:** I contacted Shidou Maki earlier, and she's working to prepare dorm rooms for you all to live in.  
**Mayumi:** My name is Saegusa Mayumi. Thank you very much for helping us here. We can't thank you enough for your kindness.  
**Mayumi:** All of us attend the National Magic University Affiliated First High School. And also, I'm a third year, while the others are all first years.  
**Mayumi:** I know. How about we all introduce ourselves first for now? I think it'll go more smoothly if we decide on an order like that.  
**Miyuki:** That makes sense. Then, I will go next. My name is Shiba Miyuki. It's a pleasure to meet you.  
**Angelina:** I'm Angelina Kudou Shields. It's sort of a mouthful, so I'd appreciate it if you just called me Lina.  
**Shizuku:** Kitayama Shizuku. Nice to meet you. Come on, it's your turn, Honoka. Show them your magic while you introduce yourself.  
**Honoko:** Hey... Shizuku\!\? It's not like you did that during your turn...  
**Miyuki:** Wouldn't that be alright? So long as you control the power output, flash magic shouldn't be very dangerous to show off.  
**Honoka:** Not you too, Miyuki...  
**Honoka:** Sigh... Then, only a little. It's going to be bright, so please don't look directly at it.  
**Honoka:** ...This is the kind of magic I'm best at.  
**Honoka:** Ahh... That was nerve-wracking.  
**Miyuki:** Honoka. You forgot to tell them your name.  
**Honoka:** ...AH\! I-I'm Mitsui Honoka... P-Pleased to meet you.  
**Hiyori:** ...So there really is magic.  
**Yume:** Wow-\! I heard there were people who could use magic, so I came along.  
**Yume:** That's awesome\! You saw that just now, right, Maki-onee-san? Isn't that awesome?  
**Maki:** Yeah... It was pretty surprising. My eyes are still flashing.  
**Honoka:** I'm sorry about that.  
**Maki:** Nah, you don't have to worry about it. It's fine. I already got used to it. Anyway, it's true, huh.  
**Mirja:** Now that Shidou Maki and the others have arrived, we can introduce ourselves. Those of us here now will likely be the ones supporting you too.  
**Mirja:** My name is Kitora Mirja. It's good to meet you.  
**Mirja:** Then, continuing on--  
**Mirja:** Now, I'll summarize the information we've heard from you. If I make any mistakes, please point it out.  
**Mirja:** It's difficult to believe, but... Firstly, magic seems to exist, and you are all from a world where people have established a system of technology based around it.  
**Mirja:** It's also still possible for you to use that magic now.  
**Mirja:** A major question remaining is, we don't understand why you have come to this world.  
**Mihono:** Mirja-san\! The biggest reason's gotta be magic\! It's magic\!  
**Yume:** For sure-. I wanna see some more\!  
**Mirja:** I understand how you two feel. However, I was stating it from a problem-solving perspective.  
**Mirja:** That reminds me, if Shidou Maki is here, is it wrong of me to assume you can provide these girls with a place to stay?  
**Maki:** Right... I wasn't sure how to respond to this at first, but I couldn't think of a reason you would lie like that.  
**Maki:** Like Kitora mentioned before, since we aren't sure how it is you came here, is it safe to say you don't currently know how to return to your own world either?  
**Mayumi:** Yes. Unfortunately, you're correct that we don't know anything about our situation.  
**Suzuka:** It's going to take time then... We'll have to conduct an investigation.  
**Suzuka:** I'd like to have some sort of clue to start from, but you must be tired with all that's happened. Would you like some time to rest or something to eat?  
**Erika:** Actually, I was just about starving, so I'd be really grateful for some food\! And, while we eat, I want to hear more about you toji.  
**Kanami:** We want to know more about magic too\!  
**Yume/Mihono:** Yeah yeah\!  
**Suzuka:** Then, let's go with that. If any of you wish to rest in your rooms, say the word and I'll guide you straight there.  
**Other:** Looking for a Lead to Get Back Home  
**Kanami:** You were more focused during that last mission that usual, right?  
**Mihono:** Yeah\! Maybe it worked out that Tsugumi-san's training gave me a kind of feeling to hold onto\! I'll try my best to focus a little bit longer when we're fighting\!  
**Kanami:** I'm getting even more excited to spar with you\~\! We've gotta do it together again, for sure\!  
**Mihono:** I'm not gonna lose next time\!  
**Yume:** Huh? Are you onee-sans going to fight? Then, I wanna join in too\! I can, can't I?  
**Kanami:** We weren't doing it right now. Just making a promise to do it later.  
**Yume:** Oh. Well that's lame-. We should just do it right away.  
**Suzuka:** Along with suppressing aradama, toji have various duties to attend to. In particular, Asakura-san has her business with the investigation team. She must be busy. And I'm sure she would want to fight when she can be at her best.  
**Kanami:** What kind of ideal did you come up in the training the other day, Yume-chan?  
**Yume:** Nnn, I don't think I really had one. They told us to imagine the strongest ideal of ourself, but I'm already super strong\!  
**Mihono:** ...That's Tsubakuro-san for you.  
**Mihono:** Ah, Miyuki-san\! What are you all doing here?  
**Miyuki:** Hello. We were just looking at the state of the town and the passerbys.  
**Yume:** Why were you doing that?  
**Miyuki:** We were thinking, if we came to this world, it must have had other effects somewhere. But, we ran into a problem...  
**Shizuku:** Since we only just got here, it's hard for us to tell if anything's off or different from before.  
**Suzuka:** I see. So that's what you were up to.  
**Mayumi:** I'm sure you must be busy with your missions defeating aradama, but... Could you help us with this?  
**Kanami:** I'm on it\! If anything catches my eye, I'll let you know.  
**Suzuka:** Preparing personnel specifically to investigate strange occurences would be difficult, but, when there are gaps in my duties, I'll try organizing a system for people to make reports.  
**Miyuki:** Thank you very much.  
**Yume:** Could you explain it more clearly so it'll be easier to find? Since you onee-sans can use magic, does that mean there'd be magic and stuff?  
**Honoka:** ...You say magic and stuff, but I don't think that's any easier for us.  
**Mayumi:** Magic is something that requires aptitude, but, for us magicians, it's commonplace, and there's a countless variety to it.  
**Suzuka:** Without something distinct to look for, I doubt we'll be able to find any phenomena caused by magic either...  
**Angelina:** It might be enough just to look for anything that gave you "a small out of place feeling". If you have any cases like that, we can go check it out and confirm whether it was really caused by magic.  
**Mihono:** An out of place feeling. I wonder... if I can really tell. But, I'll try looking\!  
**Miyuki:** Please do, Mihono-san.  
**Mayumi:** If there's anything we can do, we'll assist you, so feel free to ask us anything. Of course, that includes if you need help getting rid of aradama.  
**Suzuka:** According to the reports, there are situations where magic is useful against aradama, so we would be glad for your help then.  

## 3: Something Off in this World
Several days have passed since meeting Miyuki and the others.

  
**Kiyoka:** Hono-chan, Yui-chan. It's going your way\!  
**Yui:** Leave it to us, Kiyoka-chan\!  
**Aradama:** GUOOOOOOO\!\!  
**Mihono:** Let's go, Yui\! --HAAAH\!  
**Yui:** I'm with you whenever you need me\!  
**Aradama:** ......  
**Kiyoka:** Phew. That should be our mission done. Good work, the two of you.  
**Erika:** Man, I've been watching for a while, but you three have got some pretty good swordfighting skills.  
**Mihono:** Ehehe. You think so-? Thanks a lot\!  
**Miyuki:** Erika, are you interested, since you're accustomed to swordfighting yourself?  
**Erika:** Well, just a bit.  
**Mihono:** Ohh. You are?  
**Erika:** With my CAD-- a device that helps activate magic. Mine's this baton I'm holding here.  
**Mihono:** Huh-\! It kind of just looks like a normal baton though...  
**Miyuki:** Erika deploys magic sequences with her CAD and casts fortification magic on it.  
**Mihono:** So, without that c a d... You can't use magic?  
**Miyuki:** It's not as if we can't use it, but, when we do use magic, we generally use CAD to speed up the activation time.  
**Miyuki:** Though, it may be slightly difficult to understand for someone who isn't familiar with magic...  
**Erika:** It's probably pretty hard to get a handle on it.  
**Erika:** Ah, that's right. I've got a question for you too\! You can beat those aradama so long as you have an okatana, right? Then, if you lent me an okatana, could I fight?  
**Kiyoka:** You have to go through lots of training to become a toji, and, besides that... If an okatana doesn't acknowledge you, you won't be able to manifest its power properly... So...  
**Miyuki:** Fufu. You're saying it won't be possible for Erika.  
**Erika:** Well that sucks. I was thinking, if I could use an okatana too, then maybe I could help you guys out.  
**Yui:** Just having you cheering us on is plenty\! You're good looking and you've got a great body, and Miyuki-san is so pretty I can't wrap my head around it\!  
**Erika:** Flattering me won't get you anywhere\~. Alright, how about we head back now.  
**Mihono:** Hopefully Mirja-san and Mayumi-san have found a clue to helping you get back home by now.  
**Mirja:** Putting it bluntly, we haven't had any results at all so far.  
**Mihono:** Seriously\~...  
**Mirja:** I had thought to  get Ban Tsugumi's cooperation in finding any sort of lead, but it seems to have been a pointless trip.  
**Kiyoka:** Tsugumi-san isn't here, is she...  
**Mayumi:** It would have been nice to gain the help of a larger group of people.  
**Mayumi:** Though, I suppose it's difficult asking for advice with a topic like, "How do we return home to a different world?"  
**Angelina:** If something strange were going on because of us coming here, we might be able to come up with ideas based on that, but...  
**Mirja:** Konohana Suzuka and the others are sharing information, but there don't seem to be any plainly obvious changes or abnormalities.  
**Mayumi:** Why don't we have a cup of a tea for now to give ourselves a change of pace? I think that's important at times like these.  
**Mirja:** It's true that we should avoid overworking ourselves.  
**Mayumi:** The tea here is quite good, isn't it.  
**Yomi:** It wasn't made off the shelf, but seems like it was made brewed with tea leaves. I think that's why it kept such a nice aroma.  
**Angelina:** Hmm, you know your stuff, Yomi.  
**Yomi:** It's nothing much. I just have a slight interest in it.  
**Yomi:** That aside, was it really alright for us to sit with you?  
**Yume:** They're the ones who invited us. You worry too much, Yomi-onee-san. We'd just gotten a break too-.  
**Mayumi:** That's right. You're offering us support as well, Yomi-san.  
**Mirja:** Is there anything that's troubling you, Mitsui Honoka, Kitayama Shizuku?  
**Honoka:** No. We're fine now. We went around today to the shops that Kiyoka and Yui told us about, and bought some clothes too.  
**Honoka:** Though, it would have been nice if they could have come with us.  
**Shizuku:** They had a mission to take care of, so we couldn't bother them.  
**Honoka:** Right. It must be difficult for all you toji. Are Kiyoka and the others still working?  
**Mirja:** Those girls should arrive here shortly. They only went to see a toji acquaintance of ours.  
**Yui:** Ah, there's Mirja-san and everyone\!  
**Mihono:** ...Nnnn.  
**Mirja:** You look fairly down, Asakura Mihono.  
**Kiyoka:** We couldn't get in touch with Chie-san. ...She wasn't in her room either.  
**Honoka:** Um, who is this Chie-san?  
**Yui:** An old friend of Mihono's, and she's like the big sister of our investigation team.  
**Mihono:** What's Chii-nee up to, anyway... I feel like we haven't had any time to meet lately.  
**Mirja:** That's...  
**Mirja:** (This past week we've had missions as the investigation team, so it isn't as if we shouldn't have had chances to meet.)  
**Yui:** At times like these, you've gotta eat something sweet to get your spirits up\!  
**Mayumi:** Asakura-san, will it cheer you up if I give you some of my cake?  
**Mihono:** Uuu... Thank you, Mayumi-san\!  
**Mirja:** (It is slightly concerning after all...)  
**Kanami:** I've been having a lot of missions together with you lately, Hiyori-chan. It's sort of rare for that to happen.  
**Hiyori:** You're right... That's true.  
**Hiyori:** ......  
**Kanami:** Did something happen, Hiyori-chan? You've been looking like you're worrying about something ever since our mission at noon.  
**Hiyori:** No, it's not like I'm worried about anything. There's just something that's been bothering me.  
**Hiyori:** It feels like we've been spending the days the same day after day... Doesn't it feel like that to you?  
**Kanami:** Sort of, but I get what you're saying.  
**Kanami:** The places and times change up a little bit, but the missions are all the same... Like we're fighting the same kind of aradama over and over.  
**Hiyori:** There's slight differences. But, I guess you could call it claustrophibic; there's this small sense of discomfort building...  
**Kanami:** When did you first notice it?  
**Hiyori:** I can't say exactly when... But, I think it was around the time we met Miyuki and the others.  
**Kanami:** Then, if we can pin down what exactly is causing that sense of discomfort--\!  
**Miyuki:** It could be the reason why we came to this world... Or, it may at least lead to some sort of clue.  
**Miyuki:** That's what you're thinking, isn't it, Hiyori-san.  
**Hiyori:** Miyuki and Erika...  
**Erika:** Sorry for dropping in. We went out thinking we'd take a walk around at night, but then you two were sounding so serious talking. We couldn't find a chance to join in.  
**Hiyori:** I was thinking I would have to tell everyone soon anyway.  
**Erika:** But, you know, that discomfort that you guys are feeling? If I had to say one way or the other, I haven't noticed it at all. Everything in this world is new to me.  
**Miyuki:** That's true. Toji and aradama. They're things we aren't used to and can hardly imagine.  
**Miyuki:** I think it's wonderful that we were able to meet you, Kanami-san, Hiyori-san, but it all feels a bit like a dream.  
**Kanami:** Yeah, it really is like a dream. Getting to hang out together with people from a world where magic is real...  
**Kanami:** --Wait, it is a dream\!\? Hiyori-chan\!  
**Hiyori:** Yeah, I just realized it too.  
**Erika:** What do you mean?  
**Hiyori:** Before we met you, we were doing a type of image training using dreams.  
**Hiyori:** So Sayaka, who should normally be here at Renpu, is gone too. We really can't get anyone together besides the people here.  
**Kanami:** Yeah. I tried sending messages to Mai-chan, Ellen-chan, and Kaoru-chan too, but they haven't responded.  
**Maki:** Juujou. It looks like you've figured something out, so could you tell us all?  
**Mihono:** I want to know what it is too, Juujou-san\!  
**Hiyori:** ...This might all be a dream that we're seeing.  
**Hiyori:** Aside from Miyuki and them, the only people here are the ones who participated in the new dream training Tsugumi provided for us.  
**Tojis:** \!\!  
**Suzuka:** So we've been living on in the dream thinking that Ban-san's training was over with?  
**Hiyori:** Right. Everything looks so vivid that you wouldn't think it was a dream, so we came to the wrong assumption... We overlooked the biggest possibility.  
**Maki:** That's true... We never were officially told that the training was over.  
**Mirja:** We went to discuss this strange situation with Ban Tsugumi here during the day, but failed to meet with her.  
**Yume:** But, then why're Miyuki-onee-san and everybody here?  
**Yume:** Ah... Is it cause I kept on thinking about how I wanted to use magic in my dream\!\?  
**Mihono:** I-I did that too\!\? I was wondering if something fun like magic would happen in our dreams...  
**Hiyori:** Well, that might've had some kind of effect, but we can't be sure why they appeared here.  
**Kanami:** Even if this is a dream, that's pretty weird. Do you have any idea why that could've happened?  
**Mayumi:** Thinking about this as a dream, the only thing that comes to mind would be, the day before we became lost in this dream, the six of us were staying the night together?  
**Miyuki:** If it's within a dream, it may be possible. This sort of miraculous meeting too.  
**Shizuku:** And, if we wake up from the dream, we should be back in the world we came from. While we're on this crazy train of thought, the reason why we came here might not be all that important.  
**Mayumi/Kanami:** That's it\!  
**Yomi:** It would be wisest to think up ways to awaken ourselves from the dream then.  
**Mayumi:** Yes. It might not be anything more than a small lead to go off of, but it's a more definite goal than anything so far.  
**Maki:** Thanks, Juujou. From here, we should follow that line of thinking to solve this.  

## 4: A Way to Wake From the Dream
**Mihono:** Ah, owww\!\!  
**Kiyoka:** H-Hono-chan\!\? Why did you bash your head against the wall all of a sudden\!\?  
**Mihono:** I thought, if I did this... Maybe I'd wake up from the dream.  
**Miyuki:** Even if it is a dream, it's still painful, isn't it? I think you'd better stop, Mihono-san.  
**Mirja:** I do appreciate your willingness to try anything, but I wouldn't reccomend doing that.  
**Kiyoka:** Even in a dream... If only Tsugumi-san were here, maybe she could teach us something useful...  
**Maki:** At any rate, our problem is finding a way to wake up out of this. Though, there's the possibility that, if we wait long enough, the training will end and Ban Tsugumi will wake us up...  
**Shizuku:** It's entirely possible that, while we've spent days in this world, only a few hours will have actually passed once we wake up.  
**Miyuki:** Your goal with using dreams for training was to create a mock experience of your "ideal self", wasn't it?  
**Mihono:** Yeah, it was. We were supposed to hold onto an ideal image of ourselves.  
**Mayumi:** If that's the case, then, if everyone achieves their goal, wouldn't you wake up from the dream?  
**Maki:** That does sound plausible. I appreciate it, Shiba-san, Saegusa-san. That's some helpful advice.  
**Miyuki:** No need to thank us; we only said what came to mind.  
**Miyuki:** And, if you all wake up, as we were saying before, we should all be returned home as well.  
**Angelina:** Aradama exist in this world, and there are no other magicians besides us.  
**Angtelina:** So it should be that this world is based on the toji's consciousness, or their dreams. If they wake up, it should disappear.  
**Mihono:** The schools and everything are all stuff we know too.  
**Mirja:** Then, why don't we think once more about our "ideal selves".  
**Mirja:** Improving your ability to read a situation is not something that can be done in a single day. Though, if you wish to improve in that area, I may be able to help you some.  
**Mirja:** What will you do, Yamashiro Yui?  
**Yui:** I want to keep all the cute girls safe\! If you'll teach me how, Mirja-san, I'll try as hard as you want me\! I hope you'll be deep and thorough\!  
**Mirja:** I'll teach you even if you don't get closer like that. Then, let's review the fighting that took place in the mission earlier.  
**Mihono:** By the way, what kind of ideal did you think up, Kiyoka?  
**Kiyoka:** I was thinking... During missions, I want to do a good job fulfilling my own role; something vague like that. I don't have a clear image yet...  
**Mayumi:** In that case, why not talk it over with us for a bit? It could provide you hints as to what sort of role would suit you.  
**Kiyoka:** ...\! Thank you very much, Mayumi-san.  
**Hiyori:** Our ideal image of a toji... We were suddenly pulled into the training, so it's hard to come up with.  
**Kanami:** Maybe you don't have to worry about it so much. I think you're fine staying the way you are now, Hiyori-chan.  
**Hiyori:** Kanami...  
**Kanami:** So, help me out, Hiyori-chan\! Let's have a sparring match straight away\! To bring me closer to my ideal self\!  
**Hiyori:** You... just wanted to have a match with me, didn't you.  
**Erika:** Kanami-. If you're looking for a sparring partner, how about me?  
**Kanami:** Really\!\?  
**Erika:** We both probably have two different concepts of swordfighting. But, I think there'll be enough in common.  
**Kanami:** I'd love to have you\! Erika-san\!  
**Erika:** That's the spirit\! Don't go holding back on me, okay?  
**Kanami:** I hope you'll get serious too\!  
**Miyuki:** I'm sorry about her. Watching you all fight, it seems like Erika has been wanting to test her own strength.  
**Hiyori:** Kanami's happy to do it, so it's not a problem.  
**Miyuki:** Simply coming up with an ideal image of yourself is difficult, isn't it. I thought a bit about what I would come up with myself.  
**Hiyori:** ...Do you you think you could tell me yours, for reference? Kanami said I'm fine the way I am, but I have my own thoughts on it.  
**Miyuki:** ......  
**Miyuki:** I have someone who I don't want to disappoint, more than any other. I want to be someone that person can be proud of... That's what I thought.  
**Miyuki:** Ahh\!\? I'm sorry... I was supposed to be helping tell you my ideal, but I couldn't get it across very well, could I.  
**Hiyori:** Not at all, thanks. I'm sure that, if there's somebody you don't want to dissappoint, you'll keep putting in effort.  
**Hiyori:** I'll think about it a little.  
**Miyuki:** Of course; do what you can, Hiyori-san.  
**Mirja:** It's been what feels like several days. Even though we tried various things to simulate our ideals, we haven't seen any major changes so far.  
**Mayumi:** I thought it was a brilliant idea when we came up with it though...  
**Suzuka:** Your line of thinking was probably correct, Saegusa-san. It's just that, everyone's ideal selves are so disjointed that it's slightly difficult understanding how to achieve them all...  
**Erika:** Then, in that case, is there any ideal that every toji would work towards?  
**Kanami:** An ideal for all toji...  
**Kanami:** That's it\! What Konohana-san said just before we started the training\!  
**Maki:** -\! The ideal of most toji would be suppressing aradama while keeping casualties to a minimum-- That one, right?  
**Kanami:** Yeah\! What if we worked toward that as our goal?  
**Honoka:** I think that's a great goal to have.  
**Mihono:** Then it's settled\!  
**Miyuki:** We'll help you as well, in reducing the damage caused by aradama.  
**Suzuka:** Thank you very much. Though it may be a dream, there are still people here who need to be protected. Let's carefully work out our strategies and put them into action.  

## 5: Fighting United in a Dream. And then--
**Mirja:** People in the surrounding area are in the process of evacuating. Encircle the aradama and do not allow them to escape\!  
**Mihono:** YAAA\!  
**Aradama:** GGGII...  
**Hiyori:** You're really giving it your all, Mihono.  
**Mihono:** That's cause I'd hate being stuck in a dream forever.  
**Aradama:** GUOOOOOO...\!  
**Kiyoka:** Eh\!\? They came from outside the circle\!\?  
**Mayumi:** It's alright, Musumi-san.  
**Mayumi:** --Take this\!  
**Maki:** Saegusa-san, thanks for stopping them with your magic\!  
**Maki:** We're going to take care of the aradama who freshly appeared\! Yomi, stick close to me\!  
**Yomi:** Understood.  
**Yui:** Ah, Maki-san\! Could I go with you too? The number of aradama in the circle is already going down\!  
**Maki:** Sure. We'll sweep through them in one go\!  
**Kiyoka:** Thanks a lot. I panicked a little.  
**Mayumi:** All I did was stop them for a moment by hitting them with dry ice.  
**Kiyoka:** It's dangerous for you here, Mayumi-san, so please stand back.  
**Kiyoka:** I can't come up with an ideal image for myself as a toji right away, but I'm not worried over what I need to do right now.  
**Mayumi:** That's the spirit. Hang in there.  
**Aradama:** GGGGUUU...\!  
**Yomi:** More and more are coming.  
**Erika:** --HAAAAAAAAAH\!  
**Aradama:** ...OOOONNNN.  
**Maki:** Chiba Erika\!\?  
**Erika:** It's not in me to sit in the back and watch. I'm here to back you up. Come on, you've gotta finish it off already\!  
**Maki:** --YAAAAAAAA\!  
**Maki:** I understand that you're skilled, but be more careful with yourself.  
**Erika:** If that's what you're worried about, then hurry up and beat them. Looks like more are coming.  
**Maki:** Fine then. It's just a dream. I'll overlook it here.  
**Shizuku:** Erika couldn't resist herself, could she.  
**Angelina:** She must have been watching Miyuki and the others spamming out magic to back them up too.  
**Honoka:** Aren't you going to go in and help too, Lina?  
**Angelina:** Asking me that right after that... Aren't you making me sound like a person who likes going wild with her magic?  
**Honoka:** Ah. S-Sorry... I didn't mean it that way\!\?  
**Angelina:** I know. I'm going to hold off here.  
**Shizuku:** In that case, let's move further back. It'd be bad if we got in their way.  
**Miyuki:** I won't let you do as you please\!  
**Miyuki:** I've sealed the aradama's movements, but it won't last long. Please finish them off.  
**Aradama:** ......  
**Yume:** Leave it to me-.  
**Yume:** Wow, Miyuki-onee-san's magic seriously froze the aradama rock solid.  
**Yume:** Anybody could beat them easy like this-. Though-- It's a little boring to me\!  
**Kanami:** The risks of the mission sure drop way down, handling things this way.  
**Suzuka:** True. It wouldn't be easy to make a reality in the near future... But, surely someday it could be like this.  
**Suzuka:** In order for that to happen, we'll need to put thought into many more things than solely fighting with aradama.  
**Suzuka:** --Now then, it's about time we finished things here.  
**Everyone:** Cheers\!  
**Mihono:** I think everyone tried really hard\!  
**Mirja:** It feels as if we were only able to fight in the ideal manner we'd one day like to achieve because Shiba Miyuki and the others lent us their strength.  
**Miyuki:** I'm honored you'd speak so highly of us.  
**Kiyoka:** I wonder if we'll now wake up in the real world when we sleep tonight.  
**Erika:** What'll we do if we wake up seeing each other again after we threw this big party?  
**Maki:** If there's nothing we can do about our situation... I don't want to think about it.  
**Suzuka:** If it comes to that, it might be better for us to simply leisurely enjoy our time here.  
**Suzuka:** A lengthy vacation isn't something we could easily take, is it?  
**Yume:** Then, we should go to the pool or an amusement park\!  
**Yui:** I'm going too\!  
**Miyuki:** I think it's wonderful you can all stay so positive. Though, I have a premonition about this.  
**Miyuki:** I'm sure that Onii-sama will be there to wake me in the morning.  
**Erika:** Uwah\! Now we get a look at how serious Miyuki's brother complex is\!  
**Angelina:** It must feel like it's been countless days since she saw Tatsuya, so maybe she's going through withdrawals?  
**Miyuki:** Honestly, you two. I'll get mad. I was speaking seriously.  
**Kanami:** You're serious, huh...  
**Kanami:** Though, you know, Ban-san will probably wake us up too. Sooner or later.  
**Hiyori:** Saying that means calling it quits...  
**Kanami:** Yeah, Kanami. Even though we even had Miyuki-san and them helping us.  
**Mayumi:** Dreams are something we all have to wake up from sometime. But, it would be nice if we don't forget our meeting.  
**Kiyoka:** I agree.  
**Shizuku:** I wasn't sure how this would go at first though.  
**Honoka:** You all really took good care of us, and it was a lot of fun.  
**Angelina:** It might be hard meeting again after saying goodbye, but take care.  
**Erika:** Wait wait, quit getting all sentimental all of a sudden\!  
**Erika:** Let's eat some good food and live it up. Since we're in a dream, we don't have to worry about calories either.  
**Mihono:** I'm all for what Erika-san's saying\!  
**Kanami:** Sure\! Here, Hiyori-chan. There's a chocolate mint cake too.  
**Hiyori:** Oi, don't go making it sound like all I eat is chocolate mint.  
**Miyuki:** Fufu. I think I'll try some of that chocolate mint as well.  
**Miyuki:** (Even if this is goodbye-- I pray that we someday have such a wonderful encounter again.)  
**Tsugumi:** With this, the test of training making use of dreaming while sleeping has finished. Please remain where you are for a moment. I'll come in to get you.  
**Tsugumi:** How was this new form of training, everyone?  
**Mihono:** I missed you so much, Chii-neeeee\!  
**Chie:** M-Mihono-chan\!\? Hugging me all of a sudden... Did you have a scary dream?  
**Mihono:** No. But... I felt a little like I might never see you again.  
**Chie:** You don't have to worry. I'm not going anywhere.  
**Chie:** Tsugumi-san. How long were we sleeping for?  
**Tsugumi:** Let's see, it's been a little under four hours now-.  
**Mirja:** ...It feels like ten days had already passed in the dream.  
**Tsugumi:** I see. It seems I'll need to make some improvements in that regard. You've done enough for today, so I would be happy if you'd submit a report at a later date.  
**Tsugumi:** And, if there's any concerns you have, please go right ahead and ask.  
**Yume:** It was kinda fun though, wasn't it-.  
**Yomi:** It was. Though, I'm not sure I'll be able to sleep tonight.  
**Kanami:** Do you think Miyuki-san and them were really there?  
**Hiyori:** There's no way for us to be sure. But, I think it was a valuable experience.  
**Kanami:** Yeah. They were all such good people, and they helped us suppress the aradama without anyone getting hurt.  
**Kanami:** It'd be nice if someday we'll be able to carry out missions as safely as that.
