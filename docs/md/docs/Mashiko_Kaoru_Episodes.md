## 1: The Heart of a Mashiko

## 3 years ago--
**Classmate:** Wait, on the next mission, we're with Mashiko-san\?  
**Classmate:** I don't want to be in the same group as her\!  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.  
**Teacher:** Don't talk like that\. All of you need to be able to work together\.  
**Classmate:** But Mashiko-san helps aradama, doesn't she\? That's what my father said\! The Mashiko family is all like that\.  
**Classmate:** There's no way we can fight alongside someone like her\! What if she gets us hurt\!  
**Nene:** Ne\~\.\.\.  
**Classmate:** See, she always has that weird aradama with her too\. Who knows when it might try attacking us\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** Nene would never hurt anybody\!  
**Kaoru:** And I'm the one who doesn't want to work with toji like you\! You only think of yourselves\!  
**Teacher:** M-Mashiko-san\! Where are you going\!\?  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Nene:** Ne\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** Forget about them, Nene\. They're all wrong\. Even though they don't know anything about you, they\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.People like that, they just listen to what they're told and don't think about anything else\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.But I can't stop myself from getting mad about it\.  
**Nene:** \! Ne-\!  
**Kaoru:** Nn\? What's wrong\?  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.\! An aradama\!\?  
**Aradama:** GRUUUU\.\.\.\!\!  
**Nene:** Ne\~\~\~\~\~\!\!  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.It's almost like two cats having a turf war\.  
**Kaoru:** --But now's not the time to relax\. Nene, let's go\.  
**Nene:** Ne-\!  
**Kaoru:** See, you're not so tough\. Let that be a lesson for you\. Don't ever come back around here\.  
**Kaoru:** If you get caught here again, you're gonna get killed for real\.  
**Aradama:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.And it's gone\.  
**Nene:** Ne-\?  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.It was just guarding its home\. There's no reason to kill it\.  
**Kaoru:** No matter what people say, that's how the Mashiko- That's how I do things\.  
**Nene:** Ne-\!  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.Ughh\. If they find out I let another one go, everyone's going to get upset again\.  

## 2: The Infamous Slacker
**Nishi Kozue:** Sigh\.\.\. I'm used to getting dragged in to help out on operator duty by now, but\.\.\.  
**Kozue:** The one in charge of dealing with this aradama is Mashiko Kaoru-san\.\.\.  
**Kozue:** \"Anyway, I don't feel like it\.\" \"I just wanna go home\.\" \"I'll pass on this mission\.\"  
**Kozue:** Her reputation for her attitude really precedes her\.  
**Kozue:** All other available toji are busy with other missions, so I'll just have to rely on her\.\.\. I just have to get her feeling motivated\.  
**Kozue:** Alright\! Time to check on her progress\!  
**Kaoru:** Hello\.  
**Kozue:** Thank you for your work\! So, how's the mission going\?  
**Kaoru:** You too\. It's going smoothly so far\. I'll stay on alert for the time being\.  
**Kozue:** When we received the request for this guarding and patrol mission, I know you just happened to be in the area\. So thank you for quickly responding, Mashiko-san\.  
**Kozue:** There are plans for another unit to join up with you in just a few days\. I'm sorry, but, in the meantime, could you\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** Nah, I can handle this myself\. There's been lots of reports of sighting the aradama, but it hasn't actually caused any damage yet\.  
**Kaoru:** In fact, having more toji in the area might provoke it\. It's probably best to keep this small scale\.  
**Kozue:** \.\.\.\!\?  
**Kozue:** I see\.\.\. You might be right\.  
**Kozue:** It's just, with only you stationed there, you could be on assignment for quite some time\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** I'm prepared for that\. You don't have to worry about me\. I'll just keep up a steady search\.  
**Kaoru:** I'm the one who accepted responsibility for this in the first place, after all\. I have to see it through to the end\.  
**Kozue:** \.\.\.Understood\! Good luck in your search\!  
**Kozue:** \.\.\.She's nothing like I heard\.\.\. Mashiko-san is such a determined toji\!  
**Kozue:** She makes good judgment calls, and has a strong sense of responsibility\.\.\.  
**Kozue:** She didn't even complain once about being assigned such a basic mission\. I have a newfound respect for her\~\.  
**Kozue:** Alright, I have to do my best assisting her\. I can't overlook any bit of information that might help\!  
**Kaoru:** Ahh\~\.\.\. What a pain\. That's enough for today\.  
**Nene:** Ne\~\!  
**\?\?\?:** Man, you're so cool, Kaoru-chan\! I couldn't feel safer with a toji like you around\!  
**Kaoru:** Heh, keeping the town safe's a small price to pay for getting to eat the super famous \"Mare Sushi\"'s sushi free of charge\.  
**Kaoru:** Ah, I'll have some kanpyo rolls, thanks\.  
**Sushi Shop's Boss:** You got it\! Hey, Kaoru-chan, you should hang out here forever\.  
**Kaoru:** I don't know\~\. I'm a pretty busy girl\~\.  
**Sushi Shop's Boss:** Well we can figure something out\! We'd do anything for you toji\! Here, your kanpyo rolls are ready\!  
**Kaoru:** If you insist\~\. I guess I'll think about it\. (chew chew\)\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** Mmm\~\~\~\! So good\. Boss, your sushi's the best\. Next up, make it crab, salmon roe, and urchin\.  
**Nene:** Nenene\~\!  
**Kaoru:** Throw in some engawa too\.  
**Sushi Shop's Boss:** Coming right up\!  

## 3: Nene's Secret
**Nene:** Nene-\!  
**Mirja:** Despite there being an aradama right here, the spectrum finder shows no reaction\.\.\. What a mysterious creature\.  
**Ellen:** Nene isn't dangerous, after all\. It's right not to react to him\.  
**Kaoru:** Nene's my pet before he's an aradama\.  
**Mihono:** I don't really get it, but if he's safe to be around then I don't mind\.  
**Kiyoka:** He doesn't seem scary either, actually, kind of cute\.\.\. Um, is it okay if I pet him\?  
**Nene:** (dodge\)  
**Kiyoka:** H-Huh\?  
**Mihono:** Kiyoka-chan, you have to approach animals gently so they understand you aren't trying to hurt them\~\. Get close slowly, so they don't get scared, and\.\.\.  
**Nene:** (dodge\)  
**Mihono:** H-Huh\? He keeps running off\.\.\. Is Nene afraid of strangers\?  
**Ellen:** No, actually, the thing about Nene\.\.\. He loves big busts most of all\~\.  
**Kiyoka:** Ehh\!\? S-So that means, we\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Th-That's rude\! All of a sudden you're not so cute anymore\!  
**Kaoru:** Nene can see the future when it comes to chest sizes too\. Hate to break it to you\.  
**Mihono:** Ughh\.\.\. So, someone like Chii-nee's more Nene's type\.\.\.\?  
**Nene:** Ne\~\!  
**Mirja:** Wha\!\? M-Me too\!\?  
**Mihono:** Huh, now that I look closer\.\.\. Mirja-san's got it going on too\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** P-Please don't make strange observations like that\.\.\.\!  
**Nene:** Ne\~\! Ne\~\!  
**Kofuki:** Yo, aradama-chan\. How's it going\. Come play with me too\.  
**Nene:** Ne-Ne-\!\?   
*Nene hides behind Mihono*

  
**Mihono:** H-Hey, Kofuki-san\!\? Put your okatana away\!  
**Kofuki:** What for\? That's an aradama, you know\?  
**Mihono:** Yeah, but, uhh\.\.\. Look how cute he is\! And see, you're scaring him\!  
**Kofuki:** Huh\? What are you talking about\? Every single aradama-chan's cute\!  
**Kofuki:** Get it\? Don't go thinking you're some special kind of cute, okay\?  
**Nene:** N-Nene\~\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** Oi\. Go ahead and try it\. See if you can get through me first\.  
**Kofuki:** \.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.  
**Mihono:** The laid back Kaoru-san's\.\.\. Acting super scary\.\.\.\!  
**Kofuki:** \.\.\.Heh, it was just a joke\. As much as I love aradama-chan, a chihuahua like that's not gonna be any fun\.  
**Kofuki:** \.\.\.But when I haven't seen any in a while, and I start getting bored, who knows\.  
**Kaoru:** Nene\. Never under any circumstances be alone with her\.  
**Nene:** Ne\~\~\~\.\.\.  

## 4: Highlights from the Tournament Selection Quarterfinals
**Announcer:** In a moment, the first match of the quarterfinals will begin\. Mashiko Kaoru, Maruyama Akane, step forward\!  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** (\.\.\.This is so annoying\. It's sad how long I've had to keep doing this\.\.\.\)  
**Kaoru:** (I carelessly got in a few wins, and now if I win here, who knows how long it'll be before they let me go\.\.\.\)  
**Kaoru:** (\.\.\.Okay\. This time I'm gonna lose for sure\. Any toji who made it to the quarterfinals should be able to dodge if I do big slowã€€swings\.\)  
**Referee:** Bow\!  
**Kaoru:** (And, if I do it right, there's no way she'll ignore such a huge opening\. Alright\.\.\. With this plan, I'll shoot for a speedy defeat\!\)  
**Referee:** Begin\!  
**Kaoru:** Kieee\.  
(WHAM\!\!\)

  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.\.\.\.Huh\?  
**Akane:** Gh\.\.\.\! Such a heavy hit\! The muscles in my arms and legs are tingling-\!  
**Kaoru:** Oi\.\.\. Why'd you go and block that\? Take one look at Nenekirimaru and you should get how strong it is\.\.\.\!  
**Akane:** That's why I wanna take it head on\! Kaoru-senpai\! I've been waiting for this fight\!  
**Akane:** Senpai's full strength\.\.\. Don't hold anything back\! Give it all you got\!\!  
**Akane:** Come on and show me---\!\!\!  
**Kaoru:** A-Are you for real\!\?  
**Akane:** We'll do it fair and square\! Blocking every hit\! Feeling the results of all each other's training\!  
**Kaoru:** (This is the worst\.\.\. She's a total meat for brains\. The natural enemy to my big instant defeat operation\.\.\.\!\)  
**Kaoru:** (If we keep exchanging hits like this, I'm going to start feeling it too\.\.\.\)  
**Kaoru:** (And this hot-bloodedness\.\.\. No mistaking it, she's a real stamina monster\.\.\. This match could really drag on\.\.\.\)  
**Akane:** Was that enough warmup for you\? The real deal starts here-\!  
**Kaoru:** (\.\.\.Hell no\! I have to do something to get out of this situation\.\.\.\!\)  
**Kaoru:** KIEEEEE\!  
**Akane:** Gwahh-\!  
**Referee:** That's enough\!  
**Kaoru:** Ah\.  
**Referee:** Winner, Mashiko Kaoru\! You will advance to the semi-finals\!  
**Akane:** Dammit, you got me good-\!  
**Akane:** But that was an awesome match\! Thanks a lot, Kaoru-senpai\!  
**Akane:** I'll be rooting for you in the semifinals, and the finals too\! So you better win\!\!  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.\.\.\.Th-This can't be happening\.\.\.\.\.\.  

## 5: They're a Great Pair
**Ellen:** The target aradama both ran in different directions\!  
**Ellen:** Kaoru, let's split up\! You take the one that went that way\!  
**Kaoru:** Well, I guess we've got no choice\.\.\. I'm on it\~\.  
**Ellen:** I'm counting on you\! I'll see you later\!  
**Kaoru:** That's how it was supposed to go, but\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** Pant, pant\.\.\. This one, it's way too fast\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** At least it's stuck in this alley, since it doesn't seem populated, but why does it keep on getting narrower\.\.\.\?  
**Kaoru:** Damnit\.\.\. If I go any further than this, fighting with Nenekirimaru is gonna get annoying\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** Whatever\. It's sink or swim, I guess\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** Kieeee\!  
**Kaoru:** Ah\.  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.\.\.\.I didn't see that sign up there\.\.\. No good\. Nenekirimaru's totally stuck\.  
**Kaoru:** Nnghh\~\~\~  
**Kaoru:** Nnnngh\~\~\~\~\~  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** Kaoru-\! I took care of the aradama on my end\~\! What about yours\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** \.\.\.\.\.\.Kaoru\~\? Why're you swinging around on Nenemirimaru\? Some new game you invented\?  
**Kaoru:** If it is, it's no fun\. I can't get it loose\. Help me\~\.  
**Ellen:** Oh\! That's bad\! Wait a second, I'll help\!  
**Ellen:** I'm going to start pulling, okay\~\? Heave, ho\~\!  
**Kaoru:** Owowowww\! You're gonna rip me in half\!  
**Ellen:** I got it free\~\! Kaoru, welcome back\~\!  
**Kaoru:** Ahh, okay, okay\. I can't breathe, so quit hugging me already\.  
**Kaoru:** That was dangerous\. Please try not getting your okatana stuck while I'm away, okay\~\?  
**Ellen:** So\? Is that mission complete\?  
**Kaoru:** Nah, it got away\. But I've got it cornered in this dead end alleyway\. Just, like you saw, it's way too small for Nenekirimaru\.  
**Ellen:** So you want me to go in and finish it off for you, right\?  
**Kaoru:** Something like that\. Alright, go, Ellen\!  
**Ellen:** Hey, don't treat me like I'm your pet-\!  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.She says that, but she charged right in\.  
**Kaoru:** Phew-\. It's always a good time pairing up with Ellen\.  
**Kaoru:** She's talented enough to handle anything\. And she never makes me work harder than I have to\.  
**Ellen:** Hey-\! Kaoru\~\!  
**Kaoru:** Oh, what's up-\? You finished already-\?  
**Ellen:** The aradama's headed your way\! Give it a big finishing blow for me-\!  
**Kaoru:** H-Huh\!\?  
**Ellen:** Go, Kaoru\~\!

## [Yukata - Kaoru: Start\]: Let's Test Our Courage\!
**Ellen:** Alright then, let's get this test of courage underway\! We made lots to draw, so everyone take turns drawing them and pair up\!  
**Yui:** Guhehehe, I can't wait to go\.  
**Kiyoka:** I just hope I'm together with Kofuki-san\.\.\. Ah, mine's number 3\.  
**Kofuki:** It's not like it matters who you end up with\. Uhh, number 5\.  
**Yui:** Fufufu, Kiyoka-chan, mine's number 3\.  
**Kiyoka:** Eeeek\.\.\.\!  
**Kaoru:** You guys sure are getting excited before we've even started-\.  
**Kaoru:** I was wondering why you called us out here this late, but why're we doing a test of courage all of a sudden\?  
**Ellen:** On summer nights, you've got to do a test of courage\!  
**Kaoru:** No way; that's when you sit in an air conditioned room sipping juice watching night games of baseball\.  
**Ellen:** Don't be like that, Kaoru\! Draw a lot\!  
**Kaoru:** Fine then\.\.\. Nn, number 1\.  
**Mihono:** Ah, I'm number 1, Kaoru-san\!  
**Kaoru:** Guess we're together, Mihono\.  
**Ellen:** Is everyone paired up\? Now then, number 1, start us off\!  
**Mihono:** Hmhmhmm\~\.  
**Kaoru:** It's supposed to be a test of courage, so what're you humming for\? Aren't you scared\?  
**Mihono:** I come out in the mountains at night for missions and training and stuff, so there's no way it'd be scary\.  
**Kaoru:** (When she says it all matter of factly like that, it makes me want to scare her\.\.\.\)  
**Kaoru:** (\.\.\.Alright\.\)  
**Kaoru:** Then, since this is a test of courage and all, how about we tell ghost stories while we walk\?  
**Mihono:** Ghost stories\?  
**Mihono:** I'm fine with that, but\.\.\. There's not really any ghost stories I know off the top of my head\.  
**Kaoru:** Don't worry about it\. I've got the best ghost story to tell\.  
**Mihono:** Huh, you do\!\? What's it about\?  
**Kaoru:** (Kukuku, Mihono\. You won't be making that face for long\!\)  
**Kaoru:** Actually, this one's about where we're walking right now\.  
**Mihono:** Okay\.  
**Kaoru:** This place used to be a graveyard\.  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.\.\.\.Eh\?  

## [Yukata - Kaoru: End\]: Tell Me You're Lying
**Mihono:** \.\.\.No way, there's no way there's a graveyard this far in the mountains\. You just came up with that now, right\?  
**Kaoru:** You'd think so, wouldn't you\?  
**Kaoru:** But, this is a true story\. If you think I'm lying, you can check with Ellen\.  
**Mihono:** You say that, but\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** (Maybe if I give one more push she'll buy it\? What's something good\.\.\. Oh\.\)  
**Kaoru:** See, look over there\. There's a Jizo statue, right\?		[Jizo is a deity that is a savior of souls and also a protector of travelers\. Statues are often found in graveyards, but also along roadsides\.\]  
**Kaoru:** That's a leftover from when this place was a graveyard\.  
**Mihono:** It's true\.\.\. Then, this place really is\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Eep\!\?  
**Kaoru:** (Though, I'm making all of it up\.\)  
**Kaoru:** There's a lot of paved roads up this mountain, see\? Those are trails they made way back to let people pay a visits to the graveyard here\.  
**Mihono:** Th-That makes sense\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** But, y'know, mountains come with a lot of trouble\. Like\.\.\. landslides and stuff\.  
**Mihono:** Th-Then\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** Yeah\. That's why they decided to move away from this graveyard\. There was this really bad landslide\.\.\. And, apparently, they couldn't even check on all the graves\.  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.[gulp\]\.  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.Which means, some might've been left buried\. Just under your feet right now, there could be a dead body\.  
**Mihono/Ellen:** GYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Kaoru:** Uwah\!\? What're you doing here, Ellen\!\!  
**Ellen:** I made a mistake\! I was planning on scaring you two, but I ended up screaming by accident\!  
**Ellen:** Anyway, Kaoru\! Because of you, I can't stay here anymore\!  
**Ellen:** So, let me go with you\!  
**Kaoru:** Guess I have to\.  
**Mihono:** By the way, Ellen-san\.  
**Ellen:** What is it\?  
**Mihono:** When we left, you were there to see us off, weren't you\? So how'd you get around ahead of us\?  
**Mihono:** W-Wait, Ellen-san\.\.\.\? She's gone\.\.\.\?  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.Maybe it was just a ghost borrowing the form of Ellen\.  
**Mihono:** UWAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH\!\! We're going back\! We're going back right now, Kaoru-san\!\!  
**Kaoru:** Quit yanking my arm\! That hurts\! I was just kidding; I was kidding about everything\!  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.Huh\? You were kidding\?  
**Kaoru:** Everything I said I made up\! Ellen probably just used jin'i too\.  
**Mihono:** You were\.\.\. That's going way too far for a prank\! When we get back, I'm complaining to Ellen-san\!  
**Ellen:** Welcome back\! How did the test of courage go\?  
**Mihono:** Don't ask me\! That was really mean, scaring us like that, Ellen-san\!  
**Ellen:** \.\.\.\? What are you talking about\? I was\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** Right here the whole time, you know\.\.\.\?  
**Kaoru:** Then, the Ellen back there was\.\.\.  
**Kaoru/Mihono:** HIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE\!\!

## [Misogi - Kaoru: Start\]: A Little About the Past
**Kaoru:** Today's kinda hot, isn't it-\.\.\. My water bottle's already run dry\.\.\.  
**Nene:** Ne\~\~\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** I only have a little bit left in mine, but, want to drink it, Kaoru\?  
**Kaoru:** Gladly\. Or at least, I'd want to, but, if you ran out of yours, that'd be bad too\.  
**Ellen:** Should we make a trip back to town then\? We'd be losing a lot of time though\.  
**Chie:** Ellen-san, Kaoru-san\. It's alright\. I brought lots of drinks with me\.  
**Ellen:** Chie, thank you so much\!  
**Kaoru:** It's nice somebody came prepared\. You really saved us\. [gulp gulp\]\.\.\. Phwah\. Can't thank you enough\.  
**Chie:** It's just a part of me acting as everyone's onee-san\.  
**Ellen:** Have you been an onee-san ever since you were a little girl, Chie\?  
**Chie:** When I was little, I spent most of my time together with Mihono-chan, so it's true that back then I wanted to try hard to act as an onee-san\.  
**Chie:** Though I'm not sure it went too well at first\.  
**Kaoru:** Well, there's no way you could've been the same as a kid\. But we all depend on you the way you are now\.  
**Ellen:** That's right; Chie's our reliable onee-san\.  
**Ellen:** By the way, I've never really asked you about it before, Kaoru, but, what were you like as a little girl\?  
**Chie:** Ah, I'd like to hear about that too\.  
**Kaoru:** Give me a break\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** Don't be like that\. Do it for meee\.  
**Nene:** Nenenene\~\. Ne\~ne\.  
**Chie:** Nene-chan's asking for it too, see\?  
**Kaoru:** Kh\.\.\. Letting her hold you like that; you're totally on her side now\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** I'll tell you about it, but it's not all that interesting, okay\?  
**Ellen:** I don't believe that for a minute, Kaoru\! I have a feeling this'll be very interesting\!  
**Kaoru:** Anyway, when I was little, I was a real brat\. I used to play with kids around the neighborhood, and I sorta ended up in the position of leading them around\.  
**Chie:** That's a little unexpected\.  
**Kaoru:** It just sort of happened after I'd stand up for the ones who got left out or got messed with\.  
**Kaoru:** Maybe it's cause I was hooked on the heroes you'd see in tokusatsu shows-\.  
**Nene:** Nene\!  
**Ellen:** You still like tokusatsu heroes now too, don't you, Kaoru-\. Did aim towards becoming a toji ever since back then\?  
**Kaoru:** I guess-\. I know you know, but the Mashikos are a toji family, so my mom and grandma were both toji too\. I respected it because of that, or maybe looked up to it\.  
**Kaoru:** Becoming a toji meant you got to defeat aradama, after all\.  
**Ellen:** What else were you like\?  
**Kaoru:** What else-; when I was a kid, I played with my grandpa a lot too\. I always felt at ease being around him\.  
**Ellen:** Since I love my grandpa too, that makes us the same\~\.  
**Chie:** I'd imagine you always got along with Nene-chan too, right\?  
**Nene:** Ne\!  
**Kaoru:** About Nene\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** Before we can talk about that, it looks like we've got work to do\. There's a reading on the spectrum finder\.  
**Kaoru:** Guess we'd better hurry-\.  
**Nene:** Nene\~\!  

## [Misogi - Kaoru: End\]: Together With Nene
**Ellen:** Kaoru\! Behind you\!  
**Aradama:** KSHAAAAAA\!  
**Kaoru:** \!\?  
**Nene:** NENE--\!\!  
**Aradama:** GGGII\.\.\.\!  
**Nene:** Ne\! Nenene-- NEEEE-\.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Chie:** Nene-chan\!\?  
**Kaoru:** Damnit\.\.\.\!\!  
**Kaoru:** Outta my way\! KIEEEEEEEEEEEEE\!\!  
**Kaoru:** Is Nene okay\!\?  
**Nene:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** You can relax, Kaoru\. He's only passed out\.  
**Kaoru:** Oh\.\.\.  
**Chie:** You really do treasure Nene-chan, don't you\.  
**Kaoru:** He's family\. I don't want him to get hurt anymore\.  
**Kaoru:** All the more because, in the past, I hurt Nene once\.\.\.  
**Chie:** Eh\.\.\.\?  
**Ellen:** Something like that happened between you and Nene\.\.\.\?  
**Kaoru:** I told you before, I looked up to toji\. But, there was also a time I didn't want to be a Mashiko toji\.  
**Kaoru:** I'm not proud of it, but that was my rebellious phase\.  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.I didn't want to work as a toji who killed aradama, so I hated it\.  
**Kaoru:** But, since I was a girl from the Mashiko family\.\.\. There's no way I could just not be one\. It's not like I could go against Grandma and everybody\.  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.So I got way too fed up with it and started lashing out\.  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.Seeing me taking my anger out on stuff, Nene came and tried to calm me down\.\.\. I hit him by mistake\.  
**Kaoru:** And\.\.\. really hard, too\.\.\.  
**Chie:** That's\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** Kaoru\.\.\.  
**Nene:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** If people won't get hurt, wouldn't it be fine to let aradama be around\?  
**Kaoru:** I want to make the world a place where nobody hates aradama, including this guy here\.  
**Ellen:** I see\. I completely agree with that viewpoint of yours, Kaoru\!  
**Chie:** A world where neither aradama or people hurt each other\.\.\. I'd like that to be a reality someday\.  
**Ellen:** And, as a symbol of that, when the time comes, let's make an Aradama Park\!  
**Chie:** Eh\?  
**Kaoru:** Kuku\.\.\. Now there's an idea\. We can quit being toji and kick back and relax at Aradama Park\.  
**Chie:** I smell trouble brewing\.\.\.  
**Nene:** \.\.\.Ne\?  
**Kaoru:** Oh, you're up\? You overslept a little, but I'll forgive you this once\.  
**Nene:** Nee\?\?  
**Kaoru:** You're gonna be the park's main attraction, after all\. We'll be in trouble if you aren't in your best shape, Nene\.  
**Nene:** Nene-\!

## [Pajama - Kaoru: Start\]: Isn't It Fine Every Once in a While\?
**Ellen:** That's the last one\! It's coming your way, Kiyoka\!  
**Kiyoka:** Right\!  
**Ellen:** Good\! Nice work\!  
**Kaoru:** Good going-\.  
**Kaoru:** Though, this whole thing took longer than I expected\.  
**Kiyoka:** If we don't hurry, we won't make it back before the day's over\.  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.Couldn't we just not go back\?  
**Kiyoka:** Eh\?  
**Ellen:** Are you planning on running away from home, Kaoru\?  
**Kaoru:** That's not what I mean\.  
**Kaoru:** If we run all the way back to town now, then get on a train, what time'll it be when we get there\?  
**Ellen:** That's true; it would be very late\.  
**Kaoru:** And what do we do when we're hungry now\? Get a beef bowl in front of the station and head home\?  
**Kaoru:** I'm not\.\.\. gonna take that\!  
**Kiyoka:** S-So assertive\.\.\.\!  
**Ellen:** What you're saying makes some sense, Kaoru\.  
**Ellen:** So basically, you think we should stay the night here\?  
**Kaoru:** Exactly\. It's fine every once in a while, right\?  
**Kiyoka:** I do feel like I'd rather rest a little here than hurry back\.  
**Kaoru:** Right\? Even toji need a break\.  
**Ellen:** If that's what we've decided on, then leave the hotel reservations to me-\! I'll call a friend of mine-\!  
**Kiyoka:** A friend who will reserve us a hotel room\.\.\.\?  
**Kaoru:** She's got a lot of weird friends, so don't think too hard about it\.  
**Kaoru:** I'm all filled up\~\.  
**Ellen:** You sound like an old man, Kaoru\.  
**Kiyoka:** But, it really was delicious\. You'll have to thank your friend for me, Ellen-san, for telling us about this restaurant\!  
**Ellen:** I'll be sure to let them know-\! Now then, about the hotel\.\.\. It's this way\.  
**Kiyoka:** What kind of hotel is it\?  
**Kaoru:** It's probably some little place tucked away-\.  
**Kiyoka:** That's what the place we ate at was like, wasn't it\.  
**Ellen:** Ah, I can see it\. It's that hotel there-\!  
**Kaoru:** Which one\.\.\. Eh\?  
**Kiyoka:** Umm, you mean\.\.\. that high class looking hotel\?  
**Ellen:** Yes\!  

## [Pajama - Kaoru: End\]: Pajama Party\!
**Ellen:** Tah-dah-\! We all have matching pajamas\!  
**Kiyoka:** These pajamas are cute\! Though\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** (Since we're wearing the same pajamas, the difference in chest size is\.\.\.\)  
**Kaoru:** (That face says she's getting overwhelmed by the difference in Ellen's assets\.\)  
**Kiyoka:** No, that's not it\. Those are just pectoral muscles\.\.\. Those are just pectoral muscles\.\.\.\)  
**Kaoru:** (Kiyoka, this'll go a lot easier if you just don't think about it\.\.\.\)  
**Ellen:** What about pectoral muscles\?  
**Kaoru:** She's probably wondering how to train 'em, right\?  
**Ellen:** If you want to train up your pecs, I think it'd be good to ask Makimaki about it\.  
**Kiyoka:** \.\.\.That's true; Shidou-san's like that too\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** Anyway, how about we get to sleep\.  
**Ellen:** Since we're having a pajama party, we have to do a pillow fight and talk about love interests\!  
**Kaoru:** Huh\?  
**Kiyoka:** I'm not sure if that's right, but I'm interested in talking about love too\!  
**Kiyoka:** When you become a high schooler, do you really start getting into that kind of thing\!\?  
**Kaoru:** Nah, not really\.  
**Ellen:** We're too busy with missions, after all\.  
**Kiyoka:** That's disappointing\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** Now then, all that's left is a pillow fight\!  
**Kaoru:** Count me out-\. I'm going to bed already, so don't wake me up-\.  
**Ellen:** You're not doing that-\! Hiyah\!  
**Kaoru:** Whoa\!\? \.\.\.Don't hit me in the back of the head\!  
**Ellen:** I'm laser accurate\!  
**Kaoru:** Damnit, Ellen\.\.\. Help me out with her, Kiyoka\!  
**Kiyoka:** E-Err\.\.\. Here\!  
**Ellen:** Hesitate like that and you'll never hit me\!  
**Kaoru:** You're open\!  
**Kaoru:** Owfh\!\?  
**Ellen:** You're getting serious now, huh Kaoru\! Hyah\!  
**Kaoru:** I can catch something like that easy\! Hahh\!  
**Ellen:** I caught it too\!  
**Kiyoka:** I know we already started throwing them, but\.\.\. is it really alright for us to have a pillow fight in a hotel like\.\.\. Afwh\!\?  
**Kaoru:** Hahaha\! Never let your guard down, Kiyoka\.  
**Kiyoka:** Why do you look like you're having the most fun with this, Kaoru-san\!

## [Nenegurumi - Kaoru: Start\]: Let's Sell Nenegurumis
**Sana:** Oh, you're here, Kaoru\.  
**Kaoru:** You're the one who called me, right\? So, what'd you need\?  
**Kaoru:** You're not about to push another annoying mission on me, are you\?  
**Sana:** We've decided to start selling Nenegurumis\.  
**Kaoru:** Huhh\? What the heck's a \"Nenegurumi\"\?  
**Sana:** A Nene nuigurumi, so, Nenegurumi\.		[Nuigurumi are just stuffed toys/dolls, and I'm not punning around with the name\]  
**Kaoru:** Just leaving it at that\!\?  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.So, what do need me for with these Nenegurumis\? You want to use Nene as a model\?  
**Sana:** No, we already went ahead and made them\. Here's one\.  
**Kaoru:** Whoa\!\?  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.I-It's not the real Nene\.\.\. right\? I-I thought it was for a sec\.\.\. It seriously looks just like him\.  
**Sana:** Kaoru, go and sell this\.  
**Kaoru:** Huhh\!\? Why do I have to do it\!\!  
**Sana:** It's not forever; just for a limited time\. You know the shopping mall\? We rented a store there\.  
**Kaoru:** Saying that doesn't make it any better\.\.\.  
**Sana:** I called in somebody else to help too\. So anyway, I'm counting on you, Kaoru\.  
**Kaoru:** Seriously\.\.\.\?  
**Fujikami Minaki:** Ooh, you're here, Kaorucchi\!  
**Kaoru:** Then you're the other person, Minaki\.  
**Minaki:** Sure am\! Glad to be here\!  
**Minaki:** \.\.\.So, what am I meant to be doing anyway\?  
**Kaoru:** Did that hag seriously leave all the explaining to me too\.\.\.\?  
**Kaoru:** Nenegurumis\.\.\. We're selling Nenegurumis\. This thing\.  
**Minaki:** That was just a doll\!\? No way; I thought it was the real one\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** She said to sell these, but that's asking the impossible, right\?  
**Minaki:** Won't these sell a whole lot\? It's cute\!  
**Kaoru:** If you want it, you have it\.  
**Minaki:** Really\!\?  
**Kaoru:** I've got the real one anyway-\.  
**Minaki:** Thanks a lot, Kaorucchi\! Let's sell a bunch\!  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.If we have to\.  

## [Nenegurumi - Kaoru: End\]: Poster Girl
The Nenegurumi Shop, 3 hours before opening\.

  
**Minaki:** Uwah-\!\? The Nenegurumis fell over-\!\! Y-You okay, Kaorucchi\!\?  
**Kaoru:** Fine, but\.\.\. For how big this store is, we've got way too few people\!  
**Kaoru:** Give us more to work with-\!  
**Minaki:** It's no use saying that now-\.  
**Minaki:** We might only have two people here to set up, but more should be here to help this afternoon, so let's stick it out\!  
**Kaoru:** Minaki\.\.\.  
**Minaki:** Kaorucchi\!  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.If there's more coming to help, couldn't we call them now\?  
**Minaki:** I thought I got you feeling motivated\!\?  
**Kaoru:** Nah, nah, there's no way I'd be\. Though, I'll try in my own way\.  
**Minaki:** Kaorucchi\.\.\.  
**Minaki:** (\.\.\.Huh\? Isn't she moving a little livelier than before\.\.\.\?\)  
**Minaki:** Ahaha, you just can't be honest, huh Kaorucchi\!  
The Nenegurumi Shop, 2 hours before opening\.

  
**Kaoru:** Alright, this display's just about done\. All that's left is this big Nenegurumi\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** Just big enough\.\.\. Yeah\. How's it feel\.\.\. Yep, nice and fluffy\.  
**Kaoru:** Ooph\.\.\. Ahhh\. Well what do ya know, so this is where they were keeping heaven\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.[snooze\]\.  
The Nenegurumi Shop, 1 hour before opening\.

  
**Minaki:** Looks like we might actually make it in time for the opening, Kaorucchi\!  
**Minaki:** \.\.\.Kaorucchi\?  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.[snooze\]\.  
**Minaki:** Kaorucchi, you look like the Nenegurumi's hugging you\. So heartwarming\.  
**Minaki:** \.\.\.Hey, wake up, Kaorucchi\!  I can't finish the displays by myself\!\?  
**Kaoru:** Mmmnnm\.\.\.  
**Minaki:** \.\.\.Kh\. I'd feel real bad waking her up, but\.\.\. I've gotta harden my heart\!  
**\?\?\?:** Wait just a moment (dess\)\!\!  
**Minaki:** Y-You're--\!\!  
The Nenegurumi Shop, now open\.

  
**Girl:** Mama, look-\! That girl's sleeping with the dolly-\!  
**Mama:** Well, would you look at that\.  
**Girl:** Buy me that doll-\!  
**Mama:** Goodness, if you need it that badly\.  
**Ellen:** Just as planned\! Kaoru and all her cuteness\.\.\. she makes the perfect poster girl\!  
**Minaki:** Thanks, Ellencchi\~\! With you here, we made it safe in time for the store to open\~\!  
**Ellen:** You're welcome\! And, more importantly, before Kaoru wakes up, let's sell and sell till we're sold out\!  
**Minaki:** Sure\!  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.[snooze\]\.  

## [Police Officer - Kaoru: Start\]: Police and a Mountain Hunt\!\?
**Police PR Official:** Mashiko-san, something came up we want your help with, so could you head out to the mountains out back as soon as you can\?  
**Kaoru:** The mountains out back\? We're doing police work in the mountains now\?  
**Police PR Official:** You'll hear the details from the officers at the scene, so if you could hurry\.  
**Kaoru:** Anyway, I'm here to help\. Toji Mashiko and Nene here\.  
**Nene:** Nene-\!  
**Police Officer:** Good, you made it\. I'll get right to explaining the details of this mountain hunt here\.  
**Kaoru:** M-Mountain hunt\!\? Did aradama show up out there or something\.\.\.\?  
**Police Officer:** No, it's nothing like that\. We got a call saying someone who went hiking out here went missing\.  
**Police Officer:** All available investigators were asked to help with the search\.  
**Kaoru:** I see\.\.\. That makes sense then\.  
**Kaoru:** Though, they told us toji we were here today to help with an \"aradama safety awareness campaign\"\.\.\.  
**Police Officer:** We didn't think we'd be bringing a toji into this either\.\.\.  
**Police Officer:** But, when we checked with your superiors, Mashiko-san, they said mountain hunts are your specialty, and offered by all means to let you come along\.  
**Kaoru:** My superiors\.\.\. It's that old hag again\.\.\. Even when she's sending me to work for somebody else, she's still got to give me extra work\.\.\.  
**Police Officer:** For now, we want you to walk around the mountain and search with a police dog\. Make sure you've got a good grip on the leash and follow along\.  
**Police Dog:** Woof woof\!  
**Kaoru:** Ohh, the doggie's looking ready to go\. Don't make me work too hard then\.  
**Police Dog:** Woof woof\!  
**Kaoru:** Wait, wait up\.\.\.\! [pant\.\.\. pant\.\.\.\] Do they not teach police dogs about taking breaks or what\?  
**Nene:** Neneee\.\.\.  
**Police Dog:** Woof woof\! Woof woof\!  
**Kaoru:** Nn\? What'd you suddenly stop and start barking for\? Did you smell something in the brush here\.\.\.\? Anybody in there-\? If you're there, say something-\!  
**Police Officer:** Hm\? Just another tanuki, huh\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** Oi, doggie, if you're gonna be running us all over the place, you're sure you're actually sniffing out the trail, right\?  
**Police Dog:** Whine\.\.\. Whine\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** The heck; you're not exactly sounding confident now\.  
**Police Officer:** Hmm, now this is an issue\. Since we're not finding anything, I think the police dog's started losing motivation\.  
**Kaoru:** I understand exactly how the doggie feels\. My motivation's dropping real close to zero too\.  
**Kaoru:** But, if you don't find this hiker, we're never getting off this mountain\. Think you could give it one more shot\.\.\.\?  
**Kaoru:** Guess talking wouldn't do any good\. Sigh, what can we do\.\.\.  
**Nene:** Nene-\! Nenee\!  
**Kaoru:** Hm\? What's up, Nene\? Did you come up with some kinda idea\!\?  

## [Police Officer - Kaoru: End\]: Racing Around With a Police Dog\!
**Nene:** Nenee, nenene\! Nee, nene\!  
**Police Dog:** Whine\.\.\. Whine\.\.\.  
**Nene:** Nenee, nenene\! Nee, nene\!  
**Kaoru:** Nene, you managing to cheer up the doggie\?  
**Nene:** Nenee, nenene\! Ne, nenee\!  
**Police Dog:** Woof\!  
**Kaoru:** Ohh\! The light's back in its eyes\!  
**Police Officer:** Now they should be up to it again\. Thank you, Nene-chan\.  
**Nene:** Nenee\!  
**Kaoru:** Alright, before the doggie gives up again, guess we'll have to put in a little more effort\.  
**Police Dog:** Woof\!  
**Police Officer:** Let's get the search back underway\. Ready\! Go\!  
**Police Dog:** Woof woof woof\!  
**Kaoru:** Whoa; they suddenly got a burst of energy\. If I let go of the leash, they'd be gone in no time\. You keeping up alright, Nene\?  
**Nene:** Nenee\!  
**Kaoru:** Hey--\! Since when did you get a free ride on the doggie's head\?  
**Kaoru:** Lucky you; if I were that small too, then\.\.\. pant, pant\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** Crap, I don't have the stamina to go running from reality too\. Pant, pant\.\.\. What do you think now, doggie\?  
**Police Dog:** Woof\! Woof woof\! Woof woof\!  
**Police Officer:** What is it\? Is there something on the other side of that thicket\?  
**Police Dog:** Woof\!  
**Police Officer:** Anybody, is anybody there-\?  
**Missing Person:** Please help meee\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** They're here\!  
**Nene:** Neneneee---\!  
**Police Officer:** We managed to safely find them because of your help\. Thanks for being here\.  
**Kaoru:** If you're thanking anybody, thank Nene and the doggie\. All I did was get dragged along\.  
**Police Officer:** Well, we only had Nene-chan here thanks to you, Mashiko-san\. We really are grateful\.  
**Police Officer:** I'll make sure to send back a good report to your superior who recommended you to us as well\.  
**Kaoru:** Gegh, do me a favor and don't\. I don't want her doubling down on giving me a reputation for dealing in mountain hunts\.\.\.
