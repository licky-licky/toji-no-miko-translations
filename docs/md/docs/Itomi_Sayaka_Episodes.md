## 1: Naptime
**Kofuki:** Oiii-\! Aradama-chan-\! Don't be shy-\! C'mon out and play already-\!  
**Sayaka:** Kofuki.  
**Kofuki:** ...What?  
**Sayaka:** Be quiet. I can't hear the aradama's movements.  
**Kofuki:** Huhh? If they were that close, the spectrum finder'd tell us.  
**Kofuki:** Man, today's not my day. Of all people, why'd you have to follow me around?  
**Sayaka:** It's an order.  
**Kofuki:** Oh, is it really? I get that, Sayaka\! But whenever you're around, you steal my kills\! So just don't do anything today. Got that\!\?  
**Kofuki:** Nn\! In fact, you just head back home already. That way, I get all the aradama for me...  
**Sayaka:** There...\! Their numbers are a little more than predicted.  
**Kofuki:** Fine by me, the more the merrier\! Finally felt like showing yourselves, huh\!  
**Kofuki:** Looks like... 8 coming from the north, 5 coming from the south. Okay, I'll take north.  
**Sayaka:** I'll go south.  
**Kofuki:** And don't mess with my aradama\!  
**Sayaka:** Kofuki. One of mine is headed north.  
**Kofuki:** Leave it to me. C'mon, aradama\! I love you too\!  
**Sayaka:** Two more, headed north.  
**Kofuki:** Eh? F-Fine, I'll take care of it...  
**Sayaka:** Another one.  
**Kofuki:** H-Hey, Sayaka.  
**Sayaka:** ...You should be able to beat them, Kofuki. That's all that's left.  
**Sayaka:** I don't really love aradama, so. If you want to fight them, I'll let you.  
**Kofuki:** ...H-Heheh\! Sounds like you're finally getting it\! Hear that\! I get you all to myself, aradama-chan\!  
**Kofuki:** Pant... Too bad. It's already over, huh.  
**Kofuki:** Then, let's take a break. Take a seat, Sayaka.  
**Sayaka:** ...Break? Were there too many aradama?  
**Kofuki:** No such thing. I could've kept going if I hadn't killed them all. You got that, right?  
*Kofuki sits down*

  
**Sayaka:** Mm. I thought you could beat them, so I sent them to you.  
*Sayaka moves over to Kofuki*

  
**Kofuki:** Kuku, you catch on quick. But, aren't you tired too?  
**Sayaka:** ......  
**Kofuki:** After you sent them all to me, I started getting extra careful not to screw up my stance or utsushi.  
*Sayaka sits down*

  
**Sayaka:** ......  
**Kofuki:** Ah, but it's not like I had to. I killed them all no sweat; not a scratch on me.  
**Sayaka:** ......  
**Kofuki:** ...Anyway, I didn't think you really weren't gonna do anything.  
**Sayaka:** ...... *smiling*  
**Kofuki:** You know, you're not all that bad.  
**Sayaka:** ......  
*Sayaka slumps into Kofuki*

  
**Kofuki:** ...Wha, are you sleeping...? Hey\! Don't fall asleep on me\! Sayaka\!  
**Sayaka:** Nn......  
**Kofuki:** D-Don't look so peaceful... Hey, Sayaka\! Get off already-\!  

## 2: Classmates
**Nagasaki Sumi:** Ehh\! Ehhh\!\? Wh-Why're the aradama coming after me...\!\?  
**Sumi:** No way\! No way, no way\! Someone, h-help\!\!  
**Sayaka:** I'll deal with the aradama on the right. You handle the left.  
**Sumi:** I-I-Itomi-san...\! I can't\! I was just supposed to be observing from the back today\! I can't just start fighting like this\!  
**Sayaka:** ...Okay. If any come after you, just try to stop them. Stay in the back.  
**Sayaka:** ...They're all taken care of.  
**Sumi:** Ahh, finally. Sorry, and thank you.  
**Sumi:** They said I'd just be observing, so I didn't expect real aradama to pop out at me like that. My hands are still shaking...  
**Sumi:** ...You're amazing, Itomi-san. You're seriously strong.  
**Sayaka:** ...  
**Sumi:** I can't believe we're in the same year. The way you moved, I couldn't do that. It really takes something special to fight on the front lines, huh.  
**Sumi:** I could never fight like that. Maybe I'm not cut out to be a toji...  
**Sayaka:** ...Never? I think you just need to practice more.  
**Sumi:** Ugh... M-Mm. Maybe. I really should practice some more.  
**Sayaka:** You should commit to your attacks more too.  
**Sumi:** Ugh... You have a point there, I think.  
**Sayaka:** And you change stances too slowly.  
**Sumi:** Mm... You're right.  
**Sayaka:** And you're bad at keeping track of your surroundings.  
**Sumi:** Right... I knew it, but, it seems like all I have are bad points.  
**Sumi:** When I was chosen to be a member of the observation team, everyone just assumed I'd be strong because I'm so tall...  
**Sumi:** But with me like I am, if they send me on a mission... I don't think I could even cut an aradama.  
**Sayaka:** ...But you did cut one earlier.  
**Sumi:** Earlier? Ahh, I just got carried away. Cutting it was... Just a fluke.  
**Sayaka:** I didn't think you were too bad with a sword.  
**Sumi:** Eh...?  
**Sayaka:** Your swordsmanship was good. But, if you put more force into your swings, you'd do even better.  
**Sayaka:** Then you need to change stances faster, and pay more attention to your surroundings.  
**Sayaka:** Itomi-san...  
**Sayaka:** I practiced a lot, until I was able to do more and more. So I think you should practice a lot too.  
**Sayaka:** Do you want to practice together sometime?  
**Sumi:** Eh, with me\!\?  
**Sayaka:** Mm. Whenever I don't have a mission.  
**Sumi:** Do you really think I can improve?  
**Sayaka:** Mm. You're lacking in a lot of areas, but I think so.  
**Sumi:** A... A lot, huh. But, thank you, Itomi-san. For encouraging me.  
**Sayaka:** Eh...?  
**Sumi:** I feel a bit better. I'm looking forward to training together.  
**Sayaka:** ...O-Okay.  

## 3:ã€€Where These Feelings Reach
**Takatsu Yukina:** ...Sayaka\!  
**Sayaka:** Ah... President Takatsu. I-  
**Yukina:** So you're back. The mission this time involved a fairly large scale aradama, but you defeated it rather easily, didn't you?  
**Sayaka:** Ah, yes... Nothing went wrong...  
**Yukina:** Well done. Even Yukari-sama offered her praise. I'm very proud of you.  
**Sayaka:** ...  
**Yukina:** And the elite guard looked so ashamed. Fufu. You really did well today.  
**Yukina:** Now, Sayaka. You must be tired, so rest.  
**Yukina:** Ah... That's right. Take this.  
**Sayaka:** Eh...? A box of... Candy...?  
**Yukina:** Yes. It was delivered as a gift, but I have no interest in it. You should have them.  
**Sayaka:** I-I...  
**Yukina:** Go ahead. The sugar should help you recover as well.  
**Sayaka:** ...Thank you, very much.  
**Sayaka:** P-President, um... I'm very happy...  
**Yukina:** Ahh, of course, you must be excited to sortie again. I wonder if I can't arrange something soon.  
**Yukina:** With my Renpu students constantly proving their usefulness, it's only a matter of time before Yukari-sama realizes the incompetence of her elite guard.  
**Sayaka:** ...  
**Yukina:** The boorish Shidou Maki, that stuck up Konohana Suzuka, the impertinent Tsubakuro Yume, and--  
**Yukina:** That utterly worthless Yomi. I feel ashamed whenever I'm reminded she graduated from Renpu.  
**Yukina:** But don't worry, Sayaka. I won't allow you to turn out like that failure.  
**Sayaka:** ...Right.  
**Yukina:** You are the ultimate toji. The only one fit to guard Yukari-sama.  
**Yukina:** And, for that purpose, I need you to abandon any pointless feelings or desires. You cannot allow them to interfere with your duties.  
**Sayaka:** ......  
**Yukina:** Now then, Sayaka, I'll speak to you later.  
**Sayaka:** Abandon any... Pointless feelings.  
**Sayaka:** They're pointless... After all.  

## 4: What I Don't Want to Lose
**Yukina:** Sayaka... The greatest vessel I have ever found. Once I inject you with the noro in this ampoule, you will be complete.  
**Yukina:** You will feel nothing, think of nothing... You'll simply remove all those who would oppose Yukari-sama.  
**Sayaka:** (Nothing... What about Mai...?)  
**Sayaka:** ......No\!  
**Yukina:** Sayaka\!\? Why are you resisting...\!\?  
**Sayaka:** ...I always did what you said. But...  
**Sayaka:** I can't... Be the toji you want me to be... No, I don't want to be.  
**Yukina:** What are... What are you saying...? Sayaka?  
**Sayaka:** I thought I didn't mind being empty... But, ever since I met Mai, there's this heat inside me.  
**Sayaka:** I don't want to lose this feeling. I want to be with Mai, who was kind to me.  
**Yukina:** ...Sayaka. You aren't a defective product like the elite guard. You are the successor to Myoho Muramasa.  
**Yukina:** In place of... On my behalf, you exist to serve Yukari-sama\! To be a tool for her\!\?  
**Mai:** Sayaka-chan\! It's alright now\!  
**Sayaka:** Mai... Why? Why did you come to save me...?  
**Mai:** Because you're like a little sister to me\! That's all the reason I need\!  
**Sayaka:** (...\! It hurts... My chest hurts...)  
**Sayaka:** (But... It feels so hot... Like my emptiness... Is being filled up... I... I don't...)  
**Yukina:** Sayaka\! That's enough selfishness\!\! Return to me now\!\!  
**Sayaka:** (I don't want... To lose this feeling. So...)  
**Sayaka:** Thank you... For taking care of me until now.  
**Sayaka:** Mai... Let's go.  
**Yukina:** Stop right there... Stop... W-Wait... Come back... Sayakaaaa\!  
**Mai:** ...Sayaka-chan. From now on, we can do whatever you want, you know? I'll always be with you.  
**Sayaka:** ...I want, to eat... Your cookies, again.  
**Mai:** ...\! Okay\! Of course\!  

## 5: Feelings of Wanting to Save
**Watanuki Kazumi:** Then, the six of us from the Special Ritual Squad will be returning to headquarters.  
**Riot Officer:** Understood. Good work. We can handle cleaning things up here.  
**Kazumi:** Thank you. Now, let's leave... Nn? Where are you going, Sayaka?  
**Sayaka:** \!\! ...Yes, I was just...  
**Kazumi:** Hurry and get in the car. We need to quickly deliver our report. The president is surely looking forward to it.  
**Sayaka:** ...I'm sorry.  
--Much later

  
**Sayaka:** Pant, pant... It was right around here...\!  
**Sayaka:** ......There.  
**Cat:** Meow...  
**Sayaka:** Ah, um... It hurts... Doesn't it. Sorry. Because of what happened before...  
**Sayaka:** I'll get someone... To take care of you... You won't die.  
**Hamatsuka Sakura:** Hello, come in...  
**Sayaka:** Please, I need medical care.  
**Sakura:** Sayaka-chan? I hadn't heard you'd been injured...? Where are you hurt?  
**Sakura:** ...Ah\!  
**Sakura:** A cat... Where'd you find her?  
**Sayaka:** When I was on the suppression mission... The surrounding area was damaged--  
**Sayaka:** I think, she was nearby and got hurt. W-When I went to see her later, she was in pain...  
**Sakura:** I see... You're right... She's not doing well.  
**Sayaka:** I didn't know where to go, so, I came here.  
**Sakura:** I understand, Sayka-chan. I've never worked on a cat before... But I'll do everything I can...\!  
**Sakura:** First, I need to clean the wound... Sorry, kitty. Just bear with it a little.  
**Sayaka:** Um...  
**Sakura:** Hm?  
**Sayaka:** I might have... Been the one that hurt her. I blocked everything out while I was fighting, and when it was over, I found her.  
**Sakura:** Working as a toji is a matter of life and death, after all...  
**Sayaka:** ...Will she die?  
**Sakura:** Eh?  
**Sayaka:** Because of the injury. Is she going... To die...  
**Sakura:** Sayaka-chan... Don't say that.  
**Sayaka:** Please save her. Please.  
**Sakura:** I know you're worried. But, it's okay. I don't think the wound is that deep.  
**Sakura:** The cut was really messy, so I was a little shocked... But see, it's looking better now.  
**Sakura:** See, kitty? You're safe now.  
**Cat:** Meow  
**Sakura:** Ahh, she must be hungry too. She'll be doing better after she gets something to eat.  
**Sayaka:** What do cats eat...?  
**Sakura:** ...Cat food, I think?  
**Sayaka:** Where... Can I buy that?  
**Sakura:** Probably everywhere? At convenience stores, at least.  
**Sayaka:** I'll buy some...\!  
**Sakura:** Fufu. Aren't you lucky, kitty. A kind person saved you... Do you think you'll get better soon?  
**Cat:** Meow

## [Ceremonial Dress - Misogi: Start]: Lacking the Words
**Toji A:** What now... Yanase-san, Itomi-san\! Many more aradama are coming this way...\!  
**Mai:** It might be frightening, but no matter how many there are, what we need to do hasn't changed.  
**Mai:** Everyone finished evacuating, so let's hold our formation and take them out.  
**Sayaka:** It's okay. I can... Deal with them.  
**Mai:** Sayaka-chan\!\?  
**Aradama:** GGIII...\!  
**Sayaka:** --HAA\!  
**Aradama:** KSHAAA--\!  
**Sayaka:** Kh...  
**Sayaka:** (I want to be strong enough to defeat them on my own. If I can't... I can't protect everyone.)  
**Sayaka:** --YAAAAA\!\!  
**Toji A:** Itomi-san... That was amazing. She stopped all those aradama by herself...  
**Mai:** Sayaka-chan...  
**Sayaka:** Mai.  
**Mai:** Why did you run off and break formation?  
**Sayaka:** ...? ...I made sure to kill all the aradama.  
**Mai:** That's true. You did defeat the aradama. Still, you might be strong, Sayaka-chan, but you're not supposed to fight on your own.  
**Mai:** And you were even hurt a little.  
**Sayaka:** I thought this would be the fastest...  
**Sayaka:** You have to exorcise rampaging aradama as fast as you can.  
**Mai:** Mmm... That's not what I mean though.  
**Sayaka:** Then what...? Mai, I don't... understand.  
**Mai:** Ah, stop, Sayaka-chan\!  
**Mai:** ...Sayaka-chan.  
--The next day.

  
**Sayaka:** ......  
**Sayaka:** (...I want to talk to Mai. But... If what happened yesterday happens... I don't want that.)  
**Sayaka:** (What should I do...)  
**Kaoru:** Oh, there you are, Sayaka. So, what happened?  
**Sayaka:** ...Kaoru, there's something I need your help with.  
**Kaoru:** So you got told off by Mai during a mission yesterday, then you ran away, and now it's hard to talk to her like usual?  
**Sayaka:** With things like this... I don't know what I'm supposed to do.  
**Kaoru:** I know you want to make up with her. But, why did you do something reckless like fighting the aradama by yourself?  
**Sayaka:** Because I want to be stronger. So nobody has to go through anything painful.  
**Kaoru:** Well, Mai said she's worried about you too.  
**Sayaka:** Mai did...?  
**Sayaka:** She isn't... Mad at me?  
**Kaoru:** I mean, of course she's mad when you put yourself in danger. But it's not like she's mad because she hates you now.  
**Sayaka:** ......  
**Sayaka:** Kaoru... I want to be with Mai like I used to.  
**Kaoru:** If you think you did something wrong, then tell her you're sorry. After that, tell her how you feel. Then you'll make up.  
**Sayaka:** Thank you. I'm going to go see Mai.  
**Sayaka:** Orders to suppress aradama... I have to go.  

## [Ceremonial Dress - Misogi: End]: Feeling the Same
**Sayaka:** M-Mai...  
**Mai:** Wh-What is it, Sayaka-chan?  
**Sayaka:** I'll stop the aradama that are coming from the sea.  
**Mai:** Okay, good luck... We'll take care of the aradama trying to enter town.  
**Sayaka:** ...I'm going.  
**Mai:** Sigh... Just when I finally had a chance to talk to Sayaka-chan.  
**Mai:** No... Right now, I have to focus on dealing with the aradama here.  
**Sayaka:** ...YAAA\!  
**Sayaka:** ......  
**Sayaka:** (I want to... Finish this fast, so I can make up with Mai, but...)  
**Sayaka:** (There's a lot of them today...)  
**Aradama:** GGGIIII...\!  
**Mai:** Sayaka-chan\!\?  
**Aradama:** KSHAAAA\!\!  
**Sayaka:** ...Kgh\!\?  
**Mai:** Are you okay\!\?  
**Sayaka:** I-I'm fine... It wasn't that bad.  
**Mai:** Thank goodness... You have to make sure not to lose focus, okay?  
**Sayaka:** Th-Thank you, Mai.  
**Mai:** Let's just give it one last push.  
**Sayaka:** Mai, give me orders.  
**Mai:** Okay. Then--  
**Mai:** Good work, Sayaka-chan. ...Why don't we go back to the dorms?  
**Sayaka:** Before that... There's something I have to tell you...  
**Sayaka:** I'm sorry, Mai... I didn't listen to what you told me yesterday... And I made you worry today...  
**Mai:** No, I should apologize too.  
**Mai:** To tell the truth, Kaoru-chan told me about how she spoke with you. But still... I couldn't make up with you right away...  
**Sayaka:** No, that was my fault.  
**Sayaka:** I never had any friends before, so I didn't know how to make up after we fought.  
**Mai:** But I also should have explained sooner why I was warning you yesterday. Then there wouldn't have been this misunderstanding.  
**Sayaka:** Mai. I... I want to get even stronger. So, what happened yesterday... I might do it again.  
**Mai:** In that case, we should get stronger together.  
**Sayaka:** But, I want to get stronger so I can protect all of you. You're going to get stronger with me, Mai?  
**Mai:** That's right. I feel like getting stronger too, so I can protect you and everyone else.  
**Mai:** Because you're a very important friend to me.  
**Sayaka:** I... I feel the same way. Let's do our best, Mai.

## [Swimsuit 19: Start]: Do Your Best, Enjoy Yourself\!
**Sayaka:** ...Sorry I made you wait.  
**Kaoru:** Oh-, you made it. Now everybody's here.  
**Nene:** Ne-\!  
**Ellen:** It's too bad we couldn't all get time off together, but let's enjoy ourselves as best we can today\!  
**Ellen:** Come on, let's go to the pool-\!  
**Sayaka:** ...Kaoru, when we get to the pool, what will you do?  
**Kaoru:** Good question... When you go to a pool, you've gotta try the lazy river pool, right?  
**Sayaka:** Lazy river pool?  
**Kaoru:** You get to float down a river on a pool tube, and then you fall asleep. Just picturing it, it's the best...  
**Sayaka:** ...Is that, fun?  
**Kaoru:** 'Course it's fun.  
**Kaoru:** Just floating around in the pool is fun on its own.  
**Sayaka:** Just floating around in the pool...  
**Ellen:** Don't listen to her\! Kaoru's the only one who'd find that fun, okay?  
**Ellen:** Saaya, if you want to have fun, let's do something more aggressive... Ah\!  
**Sayaka:** What is it?  
**Ellen:** ...Saaya\! There's something important I have to check with you.  
**Sayaka:** What?  
**Ellen:** Did you... bring a swimsuit? Maybe you brought the normal school issued one...  
**Sayaka:** I didn't. Mai chose one for me.  
**Sayaka:** This one.  
**Ellen:** You can always count on Maimai\! It's the perfect color for you too, Saaya\!  
**Sayaka:** Thank you...  
**Ellen:** All my worries are cleared away then\! So... What should we play with first?  
**Sayaka:** ...There's so many things to try; I don't know what to do.  
**Ellen:** We can do anything you want, Saaya. Let's start with one side and enjoy ourselves\!  

## [Swimsuit 19: End]: Will You, Ride With Me?
**Attendant:** Okay, the next person can go-.  
**Ellen:** Oh, it's your turn, Saaya\!  
**Sayaka:** I just have to slide?  
**Ellen:** Yes\! It's just a big slide down\!  
**Sayaka:** A big slide...  
**Attendant:** Are you two friends-? In that case, the two of you can go down together-.  
**Sayaka:** Together... Ellen, will you slide with me?  
**Ellen:** -\!\!  
**Sayaka:** Ellen, are you listening?  
**Ellen:** O-Oh... ...Saaya, you're playing dirty.  
**Sayaka:** Dirty?  
**Ellen:** You're being too cute\! You're not giving me any choice but to give you a hug\!  
**Sayaka:** Ellen, now you're hugging me too tight and it hurts.  
**Ellen:** Oh, sorry about that\!  
**Ellen:** Anyway, Saaya, say what you just said again one more time\!  
**Sayaka:** What I just said... Will you ride down with me?  
**Ellen:** Good\!  
**Attendant:** Okay-, you're going together then-.  
**Ellen:** Then... Here we go, Saaya\!  
**Sayaka:** Mm...\!  
**Ellen:** Oh\! We're moving quicker than I thought we would\!  
**Sayaka:** But, I'm having fun.  
**Ellen:** Yes\! It's a whole lot of fun\!  
**Ellen:** Aww, we made it to the finish line already.  
**Sayaka:** Let's go one more time.  
**Ellen:** Of course\! Let's invite Kaoru along this time too\!  
**Sayaka:** Okay. Kaoru is... Ah, she fell asleep in the river pool.  
**Ellen:** She really did.  
**Ellen:** Just like she said she would, she's sleeping so peacefully. Let's go wake her up, Saaya\!  
**Sayaka:** Okay\!  
**Ellen:** Kaoru-\! It's time to wake up now-\! We're all going down the water slide-\!  
**Kaoru:** Whoa-\!\? What's going on\!\?  
**Sayaka:** I'm glad. I think I'll have a lot to tell Mai about the pool.

## [Shinsengumi - Sayaka: Start]: A Sudden Acting Offer
**Kofuki:** Hey, why're we stopping by this place anyway?  
**Sayaka:** ...I've been here before.  
**Mirja:** That's correct. They said they were experiencing trouble, and made a polite appeal, or rather, a request to us.  
**Kofuki:** Ooh, there's more aradama-chan here\!\? Well aren't we lucky\!   
**Mirja:** No, it isn't that kind of trouble. They requested a stuntman for their film.  
**Kofuki:** Huh?  
**Sayaka:** ...Stuntman?  
**Mirja:** That's right.  
**Assistant Director:** Ah, it's a good thing you toji girls are here. A strange rumor started up that aradama show up in our studio, and it's been giving us problems... Serious problems.  
**Assistant Director:** They say there's a high chance of people getting hurt doing stunts here if any aradama come out. Stuntmen are turning us down... All of them, in fact.  
**Kofuki:** That doesn't mean it's something you ask us to do though. I'm not doing it either.  
**Mirja:** Shichinosato Kofuki, I understand your complaint. However, this is an issue that could be considered secondary damages caused by aradama.  
**Kofuki:** Secondary damages?  
**Mirja:** Secondary damages can happen in a variety of ways. This would be considered a case of harmful misinformation.  
**Mirja:** Aradama are not commonly appearing here at the moment, but because that has happened in the past, as the director says, unfortunate rumors begin to arise.  
**Mirja:** We won't be capable of supporting them for years to come, but, whenever possible, it should be our policy to assist them.  
**Kofuki:** Damnit... Making me do the annoying jobs.  
**Sayaka:** Mai told me about it. We have to boost the image of toji.  
**Mirja:** In simpler terms, that's exactly right.  
**Assistant Director:** With that cleared up, we'd like to ask you to be our stuntman... Considering your physique, would you be able to do it?  
**Sayaka:** You want me to do it?  
**Sayaka:** I can't do anything like acting...  
**Assistant Director:** You won't need to say any lines.   
**Assistant Director:** What we want is for you to film you leaping around and jumping off rooftops. It seems like the director had seen toji fighting aradama before, and came up with the idea for this request.  
**Assistant Director:** We can't afford to delay shooting any longer, and with our lack of time, budget, and suspicious circumstances, we can't arrange to find new stuntmen, so please\!   
**Sayaka:** ...What should I do? Kofuki, Mirja...  
**Kofuki:** Do whatever you want. If you don't want to, then say no.  
**Sayaka:** ......  
**Sayaka:** If there's something I can do to help... I want to do it. I don't know if I can do it right though...  
**Assistant Director:** Thank you\! Really, thank you so much\!  
**Assistant Director:** Here, the director and film crew are waiting over this way. We can go over the details with them.  
**Kofuki:** Who'd have thought she'd end up being in a movie, huh-. Even Sayaka must be pretty shocked right about now.  
**Mirja:** I'd imagine so. Though, I was somewhat surprised that Itomi Sayaka decided on it herself.  
**Kofuki:** Well, yeah.  
**Mirja:** And also, you have a fairly caring side yourself, to stay to look after her when we aren't even sure of when the filming will end.  
**Kofuki:** That's just cause, if I went back, it's not like there's anything to do there either.   
**Mirja:** I see. At any rate, the filming should be beginning shortly.   

## [Shinsengumi - Sayaka: End]: A True to Life Take
**Film Director:** ...Action, start\!  
**Soldier Actor:** This is the Shinsengumi; we'll be taking you outlaw ronin in\! Don't think you'll get away\!  
**Sayaka:** (After they say that line... I jump.)  
**Sayaka:** Hah\!  
**Ronin A:** Kh... As if I'll go getting caught here.  
**Sayaka:** (Turn around... Face the camera, and act as though you're striking someone... One.)  
**Sayaka:** YAH\!  
**Ronin B:** Run away, run away... Everybody split up\!  
**Sayaka:** (When that person runs, chase him.)  
**Sayaka:** (Come around right in front of him, and point the tip of my sword toward him... Then done.)  
**Ronin B:** Eee\!\?  
**Kofuki:** She's actually not doing that bad.  
**Mirja:** It should be no difficulty at all for her to jump about and wield an imitation sword like that.  
**Film Director:** CUUUUUUUT\!  
**Sayaka:** ......  
**Kofuki:** Yo, nice going. What was it like? Giving that a try.  
**Sayaka:** I only... did the things they told me to do.  
**Sayaka:** It's different, from fighting against aradama or in a sparring match... It felt a little strange.  
**Mirja:** Even so, you performed it expertly. That haori fit you well too.  
**Sayaka:** I couldn't tell for myself, but that's good.  
**Mirja:** That director and assistant director made it clear they were very grateful, so it seems they thought it was a great performance.  
**Mirja:** They said they were highly impressed you were able to do those movements without the help of wires.  
**Kofuki:** And that they might come asking for your help again.  
**Sayaka:** ...I won't do this again. I was a little nervous after all.  
**Kofuki:** That's just cause nothing beats going up against aradama-chan.  
**Sayaka:** That reminds me, they said they would send us movie tickets.  
**Mirja:** All we can do now is pray the filming is finished without incident, so the film can be opened to the public.  
**Sayaka:** Mm. If this can help boost the image of toji... I'll be glad.  
**Mirja:** I'm sure you won't have to worry about that, Itomi Sayaka.  
**Kofuki:** There's nothing left to do here, so lets go home already.
