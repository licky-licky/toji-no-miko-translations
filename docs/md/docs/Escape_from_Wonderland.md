[This event came accompanied with hint cards you got for progressing through the maps. They're all at the bottom of each segment.]

  

## 1: The Photo Room
**???:** ...Kaoru, come on and wake up...  
**Kaoru:** Quit shaking me... I've got expedition duty tomorrow... I'm sleeping in until the sun sets today...  
**Ellen:** Just wake up already\!  
**Kaoru:** ......Where are we?  
**Ellen:** Good morning, Kaoru\! Now everyone's awake\!  
**Kaoru:** ...Ahh, figures you were behind this. You know, Ellen, if you're kidnapping someone, the prank's gone too far.  
**Ellen:** What led you to that conclusion\!\?  
**Ellen:** I'm not the one who did this\! When I woke up, I was just in this room too\!  
**Kaoru:** ...Wait, what. Why'd something this annoying have to go and happen.  
**Kaoru:** Did the rest of you wake up in here too?  
**Mihono:** Yeah... I remember eating with Kiyoka and Fukki, and then...  
**Kiyoka:** I felt sleepy all of a sudden... When I woke up, I was here.  
**Kofuki:** Yeah. Don't remember anything else.  
**Mirja:** Something similar happened to me. What about you, Konohana Suzuka and Tsubakuro Yume?  
**Yume:** Uhh...? Suzuka-onee-san, do you remember anything?  
**Suzuka:** Not a single thing. We all seem to have been in different circumstances, but the common factor is that none of us remember how we got here.  
**Kaoru:** Somebody's going around kidnapping toji? I bet our presid-- our old hag finally made someone snap.  
**Suzuka:** You're taking this situation in stride. Do you have experience in being kidnapped?  
**Kaoru:** Who would...? What I'm thinking is, there's two of the elite guard here.  
**Kaoru:** So they must be searching for us like crazy right about now.  
**???:** Oh no\! Oh no\! At this rate, Wonderland will be gone for good\!  
**???:** ...But, wait? Why was it going away again?  
**???:** Oh no\! Oh no\!  
**Mihono:** That voice, that's Chii-nee\!  
**Kaoru:** Chie's here... Forget searching for us, I guess we're already safe. Does that mean we can just go back to sleep now?  
**Suzuka:** We have our duties as the elite guard to consider, so I'd like to make my way out.  
**Suzuka:** And besides... Given the situation, it might be amusing to play along.  
**Mihono:** We want to get out of here fast too. We were about to go see a movie\!  
**Ellen:** Then, we're going to have to figure out how to leave this place\!  
**Ellen:** The only way out of the room is through this locked door. There has to be a key around here somewhere.  
**Mirja:** I don't see any key, however... There is a photograph on the table.  
**[Q0]:** (There is a photo of Kaoru, Mihono, Kiyoka, Kofuki, Yume, Ellen, Mirja, and Suzuka...)  
**Mirja:** On the backside there is the letter "Q"... Does it mean "Question"?  
**Yume:** Are they saying we have to answer the question if we want to leave the room?  
**Ellen:** Oh\! It's an escape room game\!  
**Yume:** The answer's easy peasy\! It's eight people\!  
**Yume:** Ehhh, why was that wrong? Wasn't the question how many people were in the picture?  
**Suzuka:** Yume, we mustn't jump to conclusions. You should think a little longer about the question before answering next time.  
**Ellen:** Hmmm... They're really making this difficult, not writing out the question.  
**Mirja:** This is only my assumption, but it's likely the answer would be too easily discovered if the full question were written out.  
**Kofuki:** Which means the answer's easy. This'll be fun; let's see Mihocchi give it a shot.  
**Mihono:** Me\!\? Umm, umm... I-Is it one of those ones where you spot the differences?  
**Mihono:** Like we compare the picture to how things are in the room now, and see if anything's different... Or something.  
**Kofuki:** Oh, that's a way better idea than I was expecting. So, what's different?  
**Kiyoka:** Hmm, it all looks the same to me...  
**Mihono:** These things usually have more than one difference, and they just keep getting harder, right?  
**Mihono:** So I think there should be one or two easy ones... Is the answer that the desk is bigger?  
**Mirja:** That seems to have been wrong?  
**Mihono:** That's weird... They gave us a photo, so I was sure they were asking what was different...  
**Kofuki:** Maybe that's a trap?  
**Kofuki:** If Chichie made this, then we've gotta see through her tricks.  
**Ellen:** This is exciting; it feels like we're getting closer to figuring it out\!  
**Ellen:** See through... What if it's that we're all awake, or that there's no photo on the table?  
**Kofuki:** There's two answers that sound good enough, Mihocchi.  
**Mihono:** Going by my intuition... The answer is, we're not asleep now\!  
**Kiyoka:** KYAA\!\?  
**Kofuki:** Why'd the lights go out... Hey\!\? Mirja's not here anymore\!  
**Kofuki:** Huh...? This is, Mirja's glasses, and a watch...?  
**Mihono:** Don't tell me... Because we got it wrong, Mirja-san got turned into glasses\!\?  
**Suzuka:** Sigh... Don't be ridiculous. It seems that, after a certain number of mistakes, one of us is eliminated.  
**Kaoru:** In that case, the time left on here is our time limit? 100 minutes... Feels like we could use it all on this question.  
**Ellen:** Don't worry. If this is an escape room game, there's sure to be some kind of hint in the room.  
**Mihono:** Did anyone see a hint anywhere?  
**Kiyoka:** No, I don't think there's any...  
**Ellen:** Really?  
**Kaoru:** Come up with something more than "Really"\!  
**Suzuka:** There's aradama\!\?  
**Kofuki:** Least they brought something to keep us from getting bored in here\! I'll take care of all of them\!  
**Yume:** No fair, Onee-san\! Let me have some too-\!  
**Suzuka:** A playing card fell out of it... Oh? Something's written on it.  
**Ellen:** There it is\!  
**Ellen:** Seems like the aradama must have taken our hint.  
**Suzuka:** The spectrum finder is still getting a reading... This won't be settled so easily.  
**Suzuka:** Let's gather all the hints we can.  
**Yume:** Aha, this is more fun than regular aradama fighting\~.  
**Hint 1:** "Don't let them get in the way of our rampage\!\"  
**Hint 2:** "If only they weren't around\!\"  
**Hint 3:** "Our natural enemy\!\"  

## 2: The Eight White Rabbits Room
**Ellen:** I get it now. The answer is... "Toji"\!  
**Yume:** Ah, a key fell down\!  
**Ellen:** Now we can move on to the next room\! Let's go see what the next question is\!  
**Mihono:** This room... It looks just like the last one, doesn't it? Maybe there's another photo lying around?  
**Kiyoka:** I don't think they would use the same question twice in a row...  
**Yume:** Onee-sans, there's two letters on top of the table.  
**Yume:** The first one has the question, and the second... What is this?  
**Letter from the White Rabbit:** Help us, Miss Toji\! Defeat the aradama, and protect Wonderland\!  
**Suzuka:** Aradama have appeared in Wonderland, and they've brought toji in to help... I suppose that's the story here.  
**Suzuka:** What does the question say?  
**[Q1]:** Two Dumptys, Five Tweedle Dums and Tweedle Dees, and six Humptys chased the eight White Rabbits.  
**Yume:** "Two Dumptys, Five Tweedle Dums and Tweedle Dees, and six Humptys chased the eight White Rabbits"...?  
**Suzuka:** Why are Humpty and Dumpty written separately...?  
**Yume:** Did you figure something out, Suzuka-onee-san?  
**Suzuka:** No... It's only that, Humpty Dumpty is one character.  
**Suzuka:** Humpty and Dumpty shouldn't be treated as two separate things...  
**Ellen:** And there's way too many people too\!  
**Ellen:** There weren't eight white rabbits, or anywhere near that many Tweedle Dees and Dums\!  
**Kiyoka:** Without the question written out, I'm at a loss... I don't know what kind of answer they want.  
**Suzuka:** ...There aren't any hints in this room either, are there.  
**Kofuki:** Does that mean there's gonna be more aradama-chan coming in here? This is the best\!  
**Kofuki:** Alright, Mihocchi\! I'll get the clues for you, so you're in charge of solving the question\!  
**Mihono:** Eh-\!\? You have to solve it with me, Fukki-\!  
**Kofuki:** We've gotta split up the work. Since you didn't help at all with the last question, you've gotta try extra hard with this one.  
**Mihono:** I-I'll try\!  
**Mihono:** Uhh... There's eight white rabbits, right? So, maybe the Humpty Dumpties made... body... doubles?  
**Kofuki:** What, like Humpty Dumpty's a ninja? You want to go with that answer?  
**Mihono:** ...Y-Yeah. Ah, we can make up to two mistakes, right?  
**Yume:** We knew that was wrong before she even said it\! Why didn't you stop her, Suzuka-onee-san?  
**Suzuka:** There's hardly a reason to get angry over one or two mistakes. So long as the final answer is correct.  
**Suzuka:** You should think up with an answer with us, Yume.  
**Yume:** I'm helping with beating the aradama, so you can answer the quiz questions, Suzuka-onee-san\!  
**Ellen:** Don't be like that, Yumecchi. I bet it'll be a lot of fun to figure it out for yourself\!  
**Yume:** Then at least give me a hint. It's too hard; I don't really get it.  
**Ellen:** Hmm, this is a tough one. We need something to set us on the right path.  
**Aradama:** GUOOOOOOO\!  
**Ellen:** Yumecchi, there's aradama\!  
**Yume:** Did they come to give us a hint\!\? HAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Kofuki:** Ah, wait up, Yume... Hey, there's none of them left for me\!  
**Yume:** That's your fault for being a slowpoke, Onee-san.  
**Kofuki:** Huhh\!\? Who're you calling a slowpoke\!\?  
**Suzuka:** And the hint... I see, so that's what they want.  
**Kiyoka:** Oh, this tells us how to answer it\! With this, we just have to...  
**Mihono:** Kiyokaaa... Even with the hint, I don't get ittt...  
**Suzuka:** You need to focus more on your studies, Asakura-san.  
**Mihono:** Uuu...  
**Ellen:** Hang in there, Mihomiho\!  
**Hint 1:** There is a hidden word.  
**Hint 2:** whiterabbit  
**Hint 3:** dumpty  
**Hint 4:** tweedledum  
**Hint 5:** tweedledee  
**Hint 6:** humptY  

## 3: The Treasure Room
**Ellen:** The answer is "Buddy"\!  
**Ellen:** [White rabbit] is "White Rabbit"\! And there were eight of them, so we pick out the eighth letter: "b"\!  
**Ellen:** If we keep picking out letters of the alphabet like that, then line them up in order, we get... Buddy\!  
**Yume:** ......  
**Suzuka:** What is it, Yume? You're pouting like something's the matter.  
**Yume:** I thought this was boring, but I'm sorta frustrated that I couldn't figure it out...  
**Yume:** I'll be the one to answer the next question, okay\!  
**Kiyoka:** In this room too, they left two letters for us. Let's see...  
**Letter from the White Rabbit:** Ahh\!\? My treasures were scattered all about\!\!  
**Kiyoka:** Treasures...? Is the question this time about finding treasures?  
**[Q2]:** MITSU TSUGU tsu ha SUI YASU no JIN ZEN GIRI ru no ya ECHI KANE ki  
**Kiyoka:** Umm, "mitsu tsugu tsu"...?  
**Yume:** Let me have it, Onee-san\! ...The heck is this\!\?  
**Mihono:** I want to see too, Tsubakuro-san\! ...Whoa, my head hurts.  
**Yume:** There's supposed to be treasures hidden in here, right? Treasures... Treasures...  
**Yume:** There aren't any treasures anywhere\!  
**Mihono:** Hang on, Tsubakuro-san\! At times like these, you're supposed to go with "tanuki", right\!  
**Yume:** Are you being serious, Onee-san? There's not even a picture of a tanuki anywhere, and there isn't even a "ta" to start with.  
**Mihono:** Ah... Uhh, th-then, let's just take out all the capitalized letters to start\!  
**Yume:** Ehh, should we really mess around with it that much?  
**Ellen:** That's one way of thinking about it. If we take out all the uppercase... Tsu ha no ru no ya ki?  
**Mihono:** Tsuha no Runoyaki? If you read it backwards... Kiya no Runohatsu?  
**Yume:** Is that a treasure?  
**Mihono:** Maybe it could be...?  
**Suzuka:** It isn't going to be so sim... Hm? Hang on...  
**Yume:** Ahhh\! Wait, stop, Suzuka-onee-san\! I'll come up with the answer, so you don't say anything\!  
**Suzuka:** ...Very well then.  
**Mihono:** Let's solve it together, Tsubakuro-san\!  
**Yume:** Why? I'll be the one to solve it, so you can just sit down, Onee-san.  
**Mihono:** Don't be like that; won't it be more fun to figure it out together?  
**Kofuki:** I've been waiting for this, aradama-chan\!  
**Mihono:** Tsubakuro-san\! We should fight the aradama too, so we can get a hint\!  
**Yume:** I can solve it on my own. Suzuka-onee-san didn't need a hint, so I don't either.  
**Kiyoka:** Hono-chan, there's the hint\! The hint for this question is...  
**Mihono:** Don't read it out loud, Kiyoka\! I'm still thinking\!  
**Mihono:** Tsuha no runoyaki, tsuha noru no yaki...  
**Yume:** Oh, I got it\!  
**Mihono:** Ahh\!\? Tsubakuro-san, don't say it\!  
**Yume:** Ehh, but if we had to wait on you, Onee-san, the time would run out.  
**Mihono:** If it comes down to this... Kiyoka\! Show me the hint\!  
**Kiyoka:** Here you go, Hono-chan.  
**Mihono:** Okay, okay... Mm? Wait, I already know there's treasures, but...  
**Ellen:** In that case, how about this hint?  
**Mihono:** Umm... Ah\! So that's how it is\! To get the answer, we just have to do this, right?  
**Hint 1:** There are three treasures.  
**Hint 2:** Toji come with what?  
**Hint 3:** Sort them out.  

## 4: The Break Room
**Yume:** The answer is "Sohayanotsuruki, Suijingiri Kanemitsu, Echizen Yasutsugu"\!  
**Ellen:** Sohayanotsuruki is Chie's, Suijingiri Kanemitsu is Yomiyomi's, and Echizen Yasutsugu is my okatana\!  
**Kaoru:** Is there some reason why it's those three?  
**Ellen:** I wonder about that...? It is interesting, but for now, let's move on forward\!  
**Kaoru:** So, in this room we've got another two letters... And next to them, some cakes.  
**Letter from the White Rabbit:** Only a little bit further to the boss\! But before that, take a quick break\!  
**Ellen:** Does that mean we can eat these cakes?  
**Mihono:** Nice-\! Which one should I have?  
**Yume:** I want this shortcake here. I'm gonna try it-\!  
**Suzuka:** Stop right there.  
**Suzuka:** I don't believe they'd leave us these cakes without some deeper reason.  
**Kofuki:** You're overthinking it. They told us we could eat them, so what's wrong with it?  
**Suzuka:** They did not say we could eat them. Mashiko-san, what is the question this time?  
**Kaoru:** It's right here.  
**[Q3]:** A: eaiohinebtehexo B: tlewtohaercherm C: ascfasttloatnto  
**Mihono:** "Eaiohinebtehexo"...  
**Kofuki:** "Tlewtohaercherm"...  
**Yume:** "Ascfasttloatnto"?  
**Kaoru:** I don't get it. Must be because I don't have enough sugar in my system. Maybe we ought to eat some cake after all.  
**Ellen:** I know\! I've got a good idea\! Let's make it a competition\!  
**Kiyoka:** A competition?  
**Ellen:** Yes\! The first person to solve the question gets to eat the cakes\!  
**Suzuka:** I don't see anything wrong with that. If we don't put some restriction on it, someone may eat the cake out from under us.  
**Yume:** ...We just have to solve the question first? Then, I'm gonna figure it out before anybody else\!  
**Mihono:** Kiyoka, let's figure it out together\! Then we can split the cakes\!  
**Kiyoka:** Okay\! I'll do my best, Hono-chan\!  
**Kaoru:** You okay with this, Ellen? These cakes are the ones from that bakery you love so much, aren't they?  
**Ellen:** Of course I am\! Rather than eating them normally, eating them after I've won them is going to make them taste that much better\!  
**Suzuka:** Now then, what connection is there between A, B, and C... Reading them in reverse... It doesn't seem to mean anything.  
**Yume:** WAAH-\! Don't do that, Suzuka-onee-san\! If you try hard to solve it, you'll figure it out right away\!  
**Suzuka:** That's the nature of the competition. I'm not about to hold back on you, you know.  
**Yume:** Suzuka-onee-san's getting serious\!  
**Suzuka:** Though, in spite of that... However I look at it, I can't find the answer.  
**Suzuka:** From the way that it's listed out, there must be some way to read it...  
**Ellen:** Hmmm, I'm not sure how though...  
**Ellen:** Judging from the previous rooms, there should be something simple we aren't getting that will make it solvable...  
**Suzuka:** Something simple...  
**Ellen:** Ah\! Eavesdropping is off limits, Hanahana\!  
**Suzuka:** Come now, don't put it so harshly. You said it loud enough for me to overhear.  
**Suzuka:** The alphabet... Removing any repeated letters... Hmm, they all seem to be wrong.  
**Kofuki:** It's aradama-chan time\!  
**Yume:** I'm going to get the hints\!  
**Mihono:** Kiyoka, we have to try too\!  
**Kiyoka:** Right\!  
**Everyone:** HAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Yume:** Umm... What is this? This hint's no good\!  
**Yume:** Onee-san, give me your hint\!  
**Kofuki:** Ahh, sure. Here.  
**Yume:** Thanks\! ...Wait, what are you supposed to do with this\!\?  
**Mihono:** Ahhhhh, Fukki, how could you... Kiyoka, what about your hint\!\?  
**Kiyoka:** Don't worry, Hono-chan\! This should be enough\!  
**Yume:** Ahh, you onee-sans can already solve it\!\? Suzuka-onee-san\!  
**Suzuka:** Oh my, are you coming to me for help?  
**Yume:** If they're going to split the cakes in half, we can do that too\!  
**Suzuka:** What am I ever going to do with you. Then, let's not waste time... Ahh, so that's how it is.  
**Hint 1:** From the start.  
**Hint 2:** In order.  
**Hint 3:** A>C>B  
**Hint 4:** Vertically.  

## 5: The Traitor Room
**Suzuka:** Yume, you may eat a piece of whichever cake you like.  
**Yume:** Huh? But we still haven't solved it yet\!\?  
**Mihono:** Konohana-san's cheating\!\?  
**Suzuka:** You do speak so poorly of me. But eating a piece of cake is the solution.  
**Kofuki:** Huh? Why's that the right answer?  
**Suzuka:** That's how it was written. If you try reading them all at once, top down from A to C to B, you'll understand.  
**Kofuki:** "Eat a slice of what is on the table to reach the next room"...  
**Kaoru:** Kaoru: If somebody'd just snuck in a bite, we would have solved this easy.  
**Mihono:** Ah, that's true...  
**Kiyoka:** B-But, in that case, we wouldn't have realized we solved it...  
**Suzuka:** Now then, let's move on to the next room. If the other letter was correct... The next may be the final room.  
**Aradama:** BUUUOOOOOOOO\!  
**Mihono:** The boss is an aradama\!\?  
**Ellen:** There's no way they'd leave aradama here as the boss\!  
**Suzuka:** Kohagura-san is right. Before we can solve that mystery, we'll have to defeat these aradama\!\!  
**Kiyoka:** The spectrum finder isn't reading anything anymore.  
**Kofuki:** What, is that all of them?  
**Yume:** They were way too weak\! I didn't get to have any fun at all.  
**Yume:** And anyway, they didn't give us a hint card either; we got a letter instead.  
**[R]:** There is a traitor among you. Listen to the white rabbit to find who can stop them\!  
**Suzuka:** This means...  
**Kiyoka:** One of us in here is a traitor...?  
**Mihono:** W-Well it's not me\!\?  
**Kofuki:** You sure about that? Chichie's the one setting this up, right? I'm thinking that makes Mihocchi the number one suspect.  
**Kiyoka:** Kofuki-san, your smile's giving it away.  
**Kofuki:** Ah, seriously\!\?  
**Mihono:** Huh? Wh-What do you mean, Kiyoka\!\?  
**Kiyoka:** It means she never actually thought you were the traitor.  
**Kiyoka:** After all, there's no way Hono-chan could keep up an act for that long, is there?  
**Mihono:** Th-That's true\! Thank goodness...  
**Yume:** Then the traitor's gotta be Suzuka-onee-san, right? Suzuka-onee-san's a good actor, isn't she?  
**Suzuka:** True, I think I could manage it. However, I am not the traitor.  
**Yume:** Are you lying...?  
**Suzuka:** I am not\! More importantly, "find who can stop them"... That part interests me.  
**Yume:** Ah, she changed the subject\! That's fishy...  
**Mihono:** Come to think of it... Konohana-san's been leading the way when it comes to solving the questions, hasn't she?  
**Mihono:** That sort of doesn't seem like something she'd do...  
**Ellen:** You're right... Now that you mention it, maybe Hanahana's acting strange... I think...  
**Suzuka:** That's because, with myself and Yume here, I decided this incident was affecting Yukari-sama\!  
**Yume:** Bringing up Yukari-sama now sounds even more fishy...  
**Suzuka:** ...It seems nothing I can say would help at this point. I'll only say this.  
**Suzuka:** I am not the traitor.  
**Yume:** Hmph. You can say whatever you want... Cause beating you is gonna solve this faster.  
**Suzuka:** That's the trouble with you... You should think things through more before you act, Yume.  
**Ellen:** You're being too aggressive\! This is just a game, okay? There's no need to get violent\!  
**Suzuka/Yume:** ......  
**Ellen:** Come on, are you listening to me\!\?  
Throughout the story so far, there are hints to the traitor's identity.

  
**Hint 1:** Combine all the answers, and what do you get?  

## 6: Escape\!
**Kaoru:** Oi, Yume. Suzuka's not the traitor.  
**Kaoru:** Isn't that right, Ellen.  
**Ellen:** ...Huh? What are you talking about?  
**Yume:** Ehh-? It's not Suzuka-onee-san?  
**Kaoru:** You're the traitor, aren't you. Ellen.  
**Kiyoka:** Umm... Isn't Ellen-san the one who can stop the traitor...?  
**Kiyoka:** By "listen to the white rabbit", it means the person who all the answers pointed to so far, right?  
**Kaoru:** See, look, the last question's the only one that's different.  
**Kaoru:** There wasn't the usual letter from the white rabbit, and the letter on the question is "R" instead of "Q".  
**Kiyoka:** Ah\! You're right... Since we're still in the escape room game, this is another part of the riddle, isn't it\!  
**Kaoru:** That's how it goes. Which means... The white rabbit didn't write the last question. It's a fake.  
**Mihono:** Huh? Then, who did write it?  
**Kaoru:** The traitor, of course.  
**Kaoru:** The question wasn't about finding who could stop the traitor, it was about discovering who the traitor is.  
**Suzuka:** ...I should have been able to see through such a simple trick, if only I were thinking more clearly.  
**Suzuka:** If the traitor is the one who wrote it... Then that makes whoever the questions indicated the most suspicious.  
**Suzuka:** Which means, she is a toji, a "buddy", owns one of the three okatana, her favorite cakes were in the room...  
**Suzuka:** It does all point to Kohagura-san.  
**Kaoru:** It's not like you could help it when the fingers were pointing at you.  
**Yume:** ...Uu, I'm sorry, Suzuka-onee-san.  
**Suzuka:** I can't blame you, in these circumstances.  
**Kaoru:** So, how'd I do?  
**Ellen:** Bingo bingo-\! You're right on the money\! The final question of the escape room game has been cleared\!  
**Ellen:** That's my Kaoru\! You stole the show right at the end\!  
**Kaoru:** Nah, I knew halfway through that you were working with whoever's running this.  
**Ellen:** Eh\!\? Since when\!\?  
**Kaoru:** Even though you got dragged into an escape room game, you were acting way less excited than you should have been.  
**Kaoru:** So, I thought that was suspicious... But I wasn't sure until we got to the cakes.  
**Kaoru:** Under normal circumstances, you would've eaten them right away.  
**Ellen:** I don't think I like how confident you are about that.  
**Kaoru:** But I'm not wrong, right?  
**Kaoru:** And you only offered to do a competition because you already knew the answer. Right?  
**Ellen:** ...I really am no match for you, Kaoru.  
**Ellen:** Now then... Here, the last key\! Kaoru, please open the door.  
**Kaoru:** I didn't think we could've been moved very far... But we're right here\!  
**Chie:** Great work, all of you\!  
**Mihono:** Ah, Mirja-san\! You were helping run this too?  
**Mirja:** Yes. Originally, I was meant to reach the third mistake early on and retire.  
**Mirja:** However... We didn't imagine that, before I could do that, you would reach three mistakes, Asakura Mihono...  
**Mirja:** Asakura Mihono, you need to have a greater sense of caution before you act.  
**Mihono:** A-Ahaha...  
**Kofuki:** What, you were here too? Which means, you actually supplied the aradama?  
**Tsugumi:** No, that was a random occurrence. We wouldn't leave out aradama for an escape room game.  
**Kaoru:** So, what was this all for anyway?  
**Chie:** Actually, some toji have been brainstorming ideas for attractions to liven up the area... This was a beta test for that.  
**Kaoru:** Just so you know, you can hire testers for those.  
**Tsugumi:** About that... Under normal circumstances, the hints were meant to be hidden in places where you can find them, but...  
**Tsugumi:** For some reason, right before the test, aradama seem to have made off with them.  
**Chie:** At that point... Ellen-san came up with a plan to get you all to help.  
**Kaoru:** So it was your fault after all\!  
**Ellen:** But it was fun, wasn't it? We have to thank Yukari-sama for allowing Hanahana and Yumecchi to join in too\!  
**Suzuka:** So you did get Yukari-sama's approval.  
**Yume:** Well, it wasn't that bad of a way to spend some time.  
**Kiyoka:** (Yukari-sama approved of this... She's actually pretty free spirited, isn't she?)  
**Mihono:** Ah, the movie\! Kiyoka, Fukki, if we leave now, we can still make it\! Let's go\!  
**Kofuki:** Oh yeah, we were gonna do that.  
**Chie:** Ah, hang on\! Here, free vouchers for the cafeteria. It's your prize for clearing within the time limit.  
**Kiyoka:** Thank you very much. If there's anything else we can do to help, let us know.  
**Chie:** Of course, you're a big help.  
**Suzuka:** Now then, Yume and I must return to our duties as the elite guard.  
**Suzuka:** Please put on the best escape room game you can.  
**Yume:** Seeya later\! It was pretty fun.  
**Chie:** Alright, the rest of us here are going to hold a strategy meeting on what to improve for the opening\!  
**Kaoru:** The rest of us here... Wait, I'm here\!\?  
**Ellen:** No complaining; come help us, Kaoru\!  
**Mirja:** Let's re-examine the beta test so we can produce an entertaining escape room game.  
**Tsugumi:** Ah, then, can we intentionally place aradama in there now? The types we can use are limited, but it's proven to work.  
**Everyone:** Out of the question\!

## [Fairytale Mihono: Start]: Off to Wonderland
**Mihono:** ......I don't get it at allll. Help me, Chii-nee...  
**Chie:** Okay, okay, which problem don't you understand?  
**Mihono:** ...From here, to here.  
**Chie:** Here to here... That's almost all of it.  
**Chie:** Mihono-chan...  
**Mihono:** Don't look at me like that, Chii-nee\! I can't help it\!  
**Mihono:** Lately I've been doing aradama suppression missions, and expedition assignments, and I had to help with the escape room game too, remember? So I haven't had any time to study\!  
**Chie:** Even if you're sure that's all there is to it, you still make me worried...  
**Mihono:** The one who's worried is me, cause I don't get any of this\! At this rate, my summer vacation is in danger of makeup classes\!  
**Chie:** Okay, okay. That's why I'm here watching you study, isn't it?  
**Chie:** Now then, first is this Japanese question. For this one...  
**Mihono:** .........guh.  
**Chie:** She fell asleep in the middle of the explanation\!\?  
**Chie:** Wake up, Mihono-chan\! We have to hurry to Wonderland\!  
**Mihono:** ...Chii-nee? Wonderland? We're done with the escape room game already...  
**Mihono:** Eh, where is this?  
**Chie:** Just how long do you plan on sleeping for, Mihono-chan?  
**Chie:** We're going on a mission to suppress aradama in Wonderland, aren't we?  
**Mihono:** An aradama suppression mission in Wonderland\!\?  
**Mihono:** ...Are you tired, Chii-nee?  
**Chie:** Okay, okay, whether you're feeling tired or anything else, just climb in that hole.  
**Mihono:** That hole...?  
**Mihono:** I have to go in here\!\? I can't even see the bottom\!\?  
**Chie:** ...What's gotten into you today? If you don't go in that hole, you can't make it to Wonderland, can you?  
**Mihono:** You're the one who's gotten into something, Chii-nee\!  
**Mihono:** If I fell down that hole, I'd die for sure\!  
**Chie:** Nobody's died going down there. You'll be fine.  
**Mihono:** And who proved that\!\?  
**Chie:** Honestly now, you can't go fussing over every little thing, you know? Now then... Have a nice trip.  
**Mihono:** ...Huh?  
**Mihono:** GYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\!\!  

## [Fairytale Mihono: End]: Which Me is the Real Me?
**Mihono:** I'M-FALL-ING-DO-WWWN--\!\!  
**Chie:** Good morning, Mihono-chan.  
**Mihono:** EEEEEEE\!\?  
**Chie:** ...Screaming like that just from seeing my face; are you trying to give me a shock...?  
**Mihono:** That's cause\! You pushed me into that hole... and I fell... Wait? Was I dreaming?  
**Chie:** Honestly now, not being able to tell a dream from reality, it's like you're having the butterfly's dream.  
**Mihono:** The butterfly's dream?  
**Chie:** It's a story about someone who dreamed that they became a butterfly, then couldn't tell if they were themselves now, or the butterfly dreaming they were themselves.  
**Mihono:** ......It sounds like a confusing story.  
**Chie:** What it means is, the Mihono-chan who's here studying now could just be a dream of the Mihono-chan who's falling forever into that hole.  
**Mihono:** Huh, that's weird......  
**Mihono:** Why'd you know I was falling forever into that hole, Chii-nee?  
**Chie:** You're so funny, Mihono-chan. Of course I'd know about that. After all--  
**Chie:** We're on our way to Wonderland to suppress the aradama, aren't we?  
**Mihono:** ...Huh?  
**Mihono:** BGYAAAAAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Chie:** Fufu, isn't this wonderful, Mihono-chan?  
**Chie:** If you don't want to study for your exams, you won't have to anymore. You can suppress aradama forever in Wonderland.  
**Mihono:** I don't want to do that either\!  
**Mihono:** Anyway, how far down does this hole go\!\?  
**Chie:** Until you think about what you've done wrong Mihono-chan.  
**Mihono:** Then, I did\! I did just now\!  
**Chie:** Did you really?  
**Mihono:** I really thought hard about what I did wrong\!  
**Mihono:** I don't want to be in the butterfly's dream anymore, Chii-nee\!  
**Chie:** KYAAA\!\?  
**Mihono:** Chii-nee\!\? You're the real Chii-nee, aren't you\!\?  
**Mihono:** Owwch\! Ith not a dweam\!\! I did it, Chii-nee...\!  
**Chie:** Are you still half asleep?  
**Chie:** Anyway, the butterfly's dream was the correct answer to the first problem. You said you didn't know, but you really did, didn't you?  
**Mihono:** Th-That's not it\! The Chii-nee inside my dream told me about the butterfly's dream...  
**Chie:** Is that so, the me in your dreams taught you about it. Then, let's do the next problem.  
**Mihono:** The me inside my dreams... Was that all it was? ......That really was just a dream, wasn't it?  
**Chie:** What are you saying? Fufufu, you're so funny, Mihono-chan.
