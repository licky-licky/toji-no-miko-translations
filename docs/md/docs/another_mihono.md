**Kanayamahime:** \.\.\.  
Had Asakura Mihono succumbed to Kagutsuchi--

  
**Mihono:** I mean, why didn't you tell me Kagutsuchi's power was this awesome before\?

**Kanayamahime:** Mihono\.\.\. That's wrong\. This is wrong\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Ahh, I want to show off how strong I am already\! I could fight the whole investigation team\!  
**Kanayamahime:** This is wrong\.\.\. That's not\.\.\. Mihono\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Nothing's wrong with it, Kanayamahime\. That's what I've got this power for, right\?

**Kanayamahime:** I am sorry\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Seriously\. I told you to stop apologizing\. If you're not gonna cut it out\.\.\. do I have to kill you too\?

**Kanayamahime:** (I must have made a mistake\. I thought to at least leave Mihono her own will, with the last of my strength\.\.\.\)  
**Mihono:** I'm just kidding\! So, stop looking like that\. Okay\?

**Mihono:** There'll be more of them, so I can just tell them again then\!  
**Mihono:** Hopefully there's somebody a little more worth killing next time\!  
**Kanayamahime:** Mihono\.\.\.   
**Kanayamahime:** I may have been wrong after all\. To keep only your will safe from Kagutsuchi\.\.\.
