## 1: Joint Training\.\.\. It Started\.\.\.
Before the start of the Renpu Heijou Joint-Training\.

  
**Suu:** \.\.\.I'm overwhelmingly out of place here\!  
**Hokuto:** Could you not start shouting out of nowhere\.  
**Suu:** But, will you\.\.\. just look around\!  
**Kofuki:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Sayaka:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Sanae:** \.\.\.\.\.  
**Suu:** Not only is there Juujou-san and Iwakura-san we met in Harajuku the other day\.\.\.  
**Suu:** There's girls like Itomi-san, who makes sure to finish any mission you give her, and that girl who loves fighting aradama way too much\.\.\. Aradama-Must-Die-Man Shichinosato-san too\!  
**Hokuto:** I told you not to be so loud\.\.\. They'll think it's rude if they hear you\. And what's Aradama-Must-Die-Man anyway\?  
**Suu:** \.\.\.That's slang for her\.  
**Suu:** She loves fighting aradama and stuff\. To where it's impossible to wrap your head around\.\.\. Isn't she sort of scary\.\.\.\?  
**Suu:** Please God, I'm begging you\.\.\. Don't put me in the same group as her\.\.\.  
**Hokuto:** You're right that there are strong fighters here from both schools, but we're only here to train together\. You're worrying too much\.  
**Hokuto:** And besides, she's another student from Renpu, the same as you\.  
**Suu:** That doesn't reassure me at a--  
**Suu:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Hokuto:** \.\.\.What is it now\? Why are you hiding behind me\?  
**Suu:** There, over there\.\.\. It's Tsubakuro-san\.\.\. and Satsuki-san, from the elite guard\.  
**Yume:** Yomi-onee-san, do I really have to be here for this too-\?  
**Yomi:** You do\. This is a part of our duties as the elite guard\.  
**Yume:** What do we have to do\?  
**Yomi:** We need to instruct everyone gathered here on the details of their training\. Though, I believe Shidou-san and Konohana-san will handle most of that\.\.\.  
**Yume:** Then, you don't need me, do you\? If I don't get to fight all the strong people I want, then I want to go home-\!  
**Suu:** (I don't want to get involved with Tsubakuro-san\.\.\. No, I don't want anything to do with anyone from the elite guard\!\)  
**Suu:** (Back then\.\.\. When we met in Okinawa, they were way too scary\.\.\.\!\)  
**Maki:** Well if it isn't Asahina Hokuto and Inami Suu\.  
**Suu:** HYAAU\!\?  
**Maki:** \? What's wrong with her\?  
**Hokuto:** Don't worry about her, Shidou-san\. Anyway, what did you need\?  
**Maki:** Nothing, just thought I'd say hi to you two\. I'm sure this training will be helpful for you\. I hope you'll make good use of it\.  
**Hokuto:** Of course; we plan on it\.  
**Maki:** It's about time for us to get started\. Good luck out there\.  
**Hokuto:** She was only saying hello\. You're too jumpy\.  
**Suu:** That was just, an irresistible force, or more like, a synergistic effect; a lot happened\.\.\.  
**Suzuka:** This training is organized to drill you on small-scale group battles, but it has one other objective\. That is--  
**Suzuka:** For you to be able to clearly convey your actions and intent to your allies in a short time, so that, even if you are partnered with someone new, you can work together to dispose of aradama\.  
**Maki:** If there's an increase in aradama appearances, the amount of missions will go up too\. In which case, you won't only be fighting with the companions you're used to\.  
**Maki:** With that situation in mind, you'll be divided into groups by lottery\. Don't go swapping your results after you draw them\.  
**Maki:** Twenty minutes after the groups are assembled, we'll carry out group battles\!  
**Suu:** (Hokuto-san, Hokuto-san\! Please let me be with Hokuto-san\!\)  
**Suu:** (Also, please don't let me be with anyone scary\.\.\.\!\!\)  
**Hokuto:** This is how it goes sometimes\.  
**Suu:** Right, I'm so glad\.\.\. God granted my prayers\!  
**Suu:** Or at least, half of them\.\.\.  
**Kofuki:** What, there's no aradama-chan here\? \.\.\.This sucks\.  
**Kiyoka:** You shouldn't say things like that\.\.\.  
**Hokuto:** I'm Asahina Hokuto, first year in the Heijou Institute's high school division\. Nice to meet you\.  
**Suu:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Hokuto:** Come on, you say yours, Suu\.  
**Suu:** I-I'm Inami Suu\.\.\. second year in Renpu Girls' School's middle school division\. Please go easy on me\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** Ah, you're in the same year as me, Inami-san\. I'm Musumi Kiyoka\. It's nice to meet you\.  
**Kofuki:** \.\.\.Do mine for me-\.  
**Kiyoka:** \.\.\.Honestly, Kofuki-san\.  
**Kiyoka:** This is Shichinosato Kofuki-san\. She's a third year in middle school\. We both work together in the Akabane swords investigation team\.  
**Hokuto:** So you two already know each other as well\. That's good then; it should be easy for us to coordinate\.  
**Kiyoka:** Right\. In this situation, what do you think we should go over first\?  
**Hokuto:** It seems, right after this, we'll be having group mock battles\. So why don't we decide on our roles in battle\? We'll start with choosing an attacker\.  
**Kofuki:** I'm not being the attacker\. There's nothing fun about going up against other people\.  
**Kiyoka:** \.\.\.Y-You can't be like that right from the get go\.  
**Kofuki:** But there's no point in teams of toji fighting each other, is there\? A toji's job is fighting aradama\.  
**Suu:** \.\.\.I-Isn't that right\?  
**Hokuto:** That's true\. There might be some logic to what you're saying\.  
**Kofuki:** Oh, nice to see you two get it\.  
**Hokuto:** However, being able to coordinate with one another is more important than anything\. That's why I won't consider this training a waste of our time\.  
**Kofuki:** If that's how you feel, then you guys can do something about this yourselves\.  
**Hokuto:** That won't do\. If you won't participate seriously, this training will lose its meaning\.  
**Hokuto:** And on top of that\.\.\. If we aren't able to coordinate during our missions, you might be injured beyond recovery\.  
**Kofuki:** \.\.\.Like I'm supposed to care\.  
**Suu:** Uhh, umm\.\.\. Why don't we all take some deep breaths and calm down first\!\?  
**Kiyoka:** \.\.\.Asahina-san is right, Kofuki-san\. If you ended up getting hurt, I'd be upset\.  
**Kofuki:** \.\.\.Tch\.  
**Kofuki:** Fine, I get it\. Let's just figure this out already\.  

## 2: Coordinating All of a Sudden Is\.\.\. Hard to Do
**Suu:** (The rule is that whichever group has the most people with utsushi removed loses, but everyone's going at it so seriously\.\.\. It's scary\.\)  
**Suu:** (\.\.\.I hope this ends soon\. But, getting cut hurts, so I don't want that to happen\.\.\.\)  
**Suu:** (So, right now, this is all I can do\.\.\.\)  
**Suu:** --You can do it, Hokuto-san\!  
**Sayaka:** HAA\!  
**Hokuto:** Kh\.\.\. She's quick\!  
**Kiyoka:** I'll be right--  
**Sanae:** I'm not letting you go, Musumi-san\!  
**Kiyoka:** Eh, when did you\.\.\.\!\?  
**Sanae:** Now's our chance\!  
**Tsugumi:** Understood\.  
**Kofuki:** You're actually taking this seriously\.\.\. Really\?  
**Tsugumi:** That's rude\. I'm fundamentally a serious person, aren't I\?  
**Tsugumi:** It would be a problem if they didn't think I was serious and our research funding was reduced-\.  
**Tsugumi:** Though, you're not my opponent now anyway, Shichinosato-san\.  
**Hokuto:** \.\.\.Suu, stand firm\!  
**Suu:** Thinking about it, they have to be coming after me, right--\!\?  
**Tsugumi:** Sorry about this\. Anyway\.  
**Suu:** NOOOOOO\!\?  
**Suu:** Even with utsushi, it still hurts\.\.\. Uuu\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** I know what you mean\.\.\. It sure hurts, doesn't it\. When you're being slashed, you can't help but flinch against it\.  
**Suu:** Ahh, I'm so glad someone here understands\! Thank you, Musumi-san\!  
**Suu:** I can't be useful at all, so I\.\.\. I'm thinking of withdrawing from this\. I feel like that's the best way for me to contribute\!  
**Kiyoka:** Eh\.\.\. P-Please, hold on a minute\!\? We'll be in trouble without you, Inami-san\!  
**Kiyoka:** And also, this is just a maybe, but\.\.\. If Kofuki-san and Asahina-san can't coordinate, then this group won't\.\.\.  
**Suu:** \.\.\.Right\.  
**Hokuto:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** If you won't cooperate some more, we won't be able to practice anything\.\.\.  
**Kofuki:** There's no aradama-chan here, so no thanks-\.  
**Kiyoka:** \.\.\.But, didn't you say you understood that before\?  
**Hokuto:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Suu:** (Ah-\.\.\. I think Hokuto-san's mad\.\.\. I'm not even the one who made her mad, but I'm feeling sort of uneasy\.\)  
**Suu:** (I wish that someone would step in and reconcile this\.\.\. Even someone from the elite guard would be fine, just, won't someone stop them\?\)  
**Yume:** Nn-\? Huh, Onee-san\?  
**Suu:** Ah, I didn't mean it after all\!  
**Yume:** Didn't mean what\?  
**Suu:** \.\.\.It's nothing\.  
**Yume:** I think I might've seen you before\. Did we meet somewhere, Onee-san\?  
**Suu:** Ehh-\.\.\. Ahh-\.\.\. Umm-\.\.\. Uhh-\.\.\.  
**Suu:** (What should I do, what should I do\.\.\. Maybe it'd be fine if I said honestly, we met last year in Okinawa\? But, but, if I pretend like she's got the wrong person, maybe she'll lose interest and go away\!\?\)  
**Yume:** I can't tell what you mean when you just say \"Uhh-\.\.\.\", Onee-san\.  
**Suu:** Th-There's no way we could have met anywhere before, Tsubakuro-sama\.\.\.  
**Yume:** Why're you calling me Tsubakuro-sama even though I'm younger\? Wait, this feels familiar for some reason\.\.\.  
**Suu:** AWAWA\.\.\.\! Umm, umm\.\.\. It looks like you elite guard are having another tough day of work, huh\!  
**Yume:** Not really-\.\.\. There's nothing to do, so I'm just bored\. It's not like I get to fight anybody strong either-\.  
**Yume:** I'm tired of this, so I'm going to go play with Yukari-sama\! Bye bye\~\.  
**Suu:** Tsubakuro-san\.\.\. You're as free spirited as ever\.\.\. I'm jealous\.\.\.  
**Announcer:** We are beginning the next match, so will the following groups please prepare straight away\.  

## 3: How Did it Come to This\.\.\.\?
**Maki:** So each group has gone through a number of battle exercises at this point\. Hm\.\.\.  
**Maki:** (Though, there's groups that are coordinating well, and those that aren't\. The difference is greater than I was expecting\.\)  
**Maki:** (Even when you gather nothing but people greatly skilled at fighting, they might not function properly as a team in some cases\.\)  
**Maki:** (Asahina and Shichinosato's coordination is going to take time to improve, won't it\.\.\.\)  
**Maki:** (Getting rid of ignorance within a unit is another part of this training's goals\. I'll watch them carefully for now\.\)  
**Suu:** We lost again, didn't we\.\.\.  
**Kofuki:** The hell, I fought like you told me to, didn't I\? And anyway, she's barely fighting worth anything either\.  
**Suu:** Ah, that's true\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** Hey\.\.\. Kofuki-san\!  
**Kiyoka:** U-Um\.\.\. Try not to let it get you down, Inami-san\.  
**Hokuto:** It's true that, with how fearful Suu is acting, I can't call her an asset to the team\.  
**Hokuto:** Even when I put her through training whenever we meet, I wouldn't say she's very enthusiastic\.  
**Suu:** Hokuto-san, even if it's true, when you say it out loud\.\.\. You're making me depressed\.  
**Hokuto:** But, you should be capable of fighting harder than that\. Shichinosato-san\.  
**Kofuki:** Yeah and, what about it\?  
**Hokuto:** I understand full well that you won't get serious unless you're fighting against aradama\.  
**Hokuto:** However, I'd hate it if this training went on like this\. We were given the chance to participate, so I don't want it to go to waste\.  
**Hokuto:** Which is why\.\.\.  
**Suu:** They did\! At first, Noa-chan and Eden-san used to be so serious about their idol activities, and apparently they got in lots of arguments over where to take their careers\.  
**Suu:** They said that, in order to decide who'd lead them, they had a bunch of battles, like, who could get the highest score in karaoke, or who could hold a smile the longest\.  
**Suu:** But, as they did that, it made them start understanding each other better\! Isn't that so idol-like\!  
**Hokuto:** I don't exactly know\.\.\. what is and isn't idol-like\. But it's true that battling can be a way to bring people together\.  
**Hokuto:** \.\.\.Let's settle this with a match\. What do you say we agree the loser will obey the winner for the remainder of this training\?  
**Kofuki:** \.\.\.Huh\?  
**Hokuto:** If you win, I won't complain\.  
**Kofuki:** Have you got muscles for brains or what\.\.\.\?  
**Kofuki:** But, fine\. If I win, then this lameass argument's done with too\.  
**Suu:** E-Eh\.\.\. Is it really okay for you to duel like this\?  
**Hokuto:** It's not a duel\. This is simply practice in the form of a standard match\. Move away\.  
**Suu:** You can't go pushing yourself too hard just because your leg injury healed\.  
**Hokuto:** Thank you\. I know\.  
**Kiyoka:** You could have just done the practice properly\.  
**Kofuki:** It's fine\.  
**Kofuki:** Let's get this started already\.  
**Hokuto:** I'm ready anytime\.  
**Kofuki:** Then I'll get right to it--\!  
**Hokuto:** You are strong\.\.\. But\!  
**Hokuto:** --HAAA\!  
**Kofuki:** Tch\.\.\.  
**Suu:** What's going to happen\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** \.\.\.Mm\.  
**Yomi:** It seems like some people have started a match on their own\.\.\.  
**Maki:** Wait, just leave them for now\. If the situation gets worse, we'll step in\.  
**Maki:** Hopefully this can bring about some kind of change in that group\.  
**Suzuka:** Maki-san, it seems a mass outbreak of aradama has occurred in Harajuku just now\.  
**Maki:** \.\.\.\!  
**Suzuka:** I only just got the report\. This joint-training has been changed to a joint-operation\. The elite guard are to direct their suppression\.  
**Maki:** Got it\. Let's hurry\!  
**Hokuto:** It seems like now's not the time for our match\.  
**Kofuki:** Sounds like a whole load of aradama-chan are out there\. Good thing I joined in on this training\.  
**Hokuto:** We'll be up against aradama, so I'll be depending on you readily\.  
**Suu:** Ahhh, why did this have to happen-\!\?
