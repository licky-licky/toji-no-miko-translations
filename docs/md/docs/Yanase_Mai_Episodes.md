## 1: Pudding Unlike This
**Kanami:** Mai-chan, we're here\~\! Today's special guest is... Mihono-chan\!  
**Mihono:** Umm. Hi, Yanase-san. Sorry if I'm being a bother.  
**Mihono:** I ran into Kanami before, and she said I should tag along, so...  
**Mai:** Don't worry, it's fine. Sorry I invited you here so abruptly, Asakura-san, Kanami-chan.  
**Mihono:** Ah, something smells really good\!  
**Kanami:** Mai-chan, you made that, didn't you\! The stuff that's all sticky and smooth\~.  
**Mai:** That's right. I can't believe you figured it out already, Kanami-chan. I made pudding, but actually...  
**Mai:** Ah, you should try some first\! I just hope it turned out alright.  
**Kanami:** Everything you make turns out great, Mai-chan\!  
**Mai:** ...R-Right.  
**Mihono:** ...Yanase-san? What's wrong? You look upset about something.  
**Mai:** Sorry, it's nothing\! Here, come on inside\!  
**Mihono:** Whoa, it looks delicious. You sure I can eat this\!\?  
**Mai:** Of course. If you're sure you want some, go right ahead.  
**Kanami:** No one in the world wouldn't want your cooking, Mai-chan\! Anyway, I'm digging in-\!  
**Mihono:** Me too\! Down the hatch-\!  
**Kanami:** Mhmmm, ahh...  
**Mihono:** It's... It's too yummy\!  
**Mai:** Thank goodness. But, um... Was there anything else that you noticed about it?  
**Kanami:** It's just really tasty.  
**Mihono:** Yeah, it's so tasty\!  
**Mai:** Th-Thank you. But, let's see, for example, if it tastes like anything you've tried before...  
**Mai:** Like, maybe, a certain shop's pudding...  
**Kanami:** Anything I've tried? Umm... Mihono-chan, what do you think?  
**Mihono:** I don't really... Go out shopping much, so I don't know. But, Yanase-san, I feel like your pudding's better than anything I could buy?  
**Kanami:** Yeah, I feel the same\! I've never had anything like it. Mai-chan, your pudding's amazing\!  
**Mai:** ...A-Ahaha, thank you.  
**Kanami:** Mai-chan? Something's bothering you, isn't it?  
**Mai:** It's not a big deal... This was just a bit of a failure.  
**Mihono:** Eh, how\!\?  
**Mai:** To tell the truth, I was trying to copy the pudding from a shop I love.  
**Kanami:** A shop Mai-chan loves... "Plumeria"?  
**Kanami:** Ahh... Mmm? Now that you mention it, it tastes sort of alike, I think?  
**Mihono:** (Ughh, I can't believe I said I don't go out much...)  
**Mai:** No, don't worry about it, Kanami-chan... After all, it'd be strange if I could copy a famous chef's pudding so easily.  
**Mai:** My little sisters, they told me they wanted to be able get the same taste at home. So I kept on practicing time and time again, and kept going to eat the real thing to compare, and I used all the same materials, just as fresh...\!  
**Mihono:** Yanase... San?  
**Mai:** I tried heating with different intensity, and steaming it differently, and lots of different containers. But why, even though I keep on trying... No, I just can't get it to taste any good.  
**Mai:** I love cooking sweets so much, but in the end I'm just an amateur...  
**Kanami:** You're frustrated, huh, Mai-chan.  
**Mai:** Eh, you can tell...?  
**Mihono:** It's kind of hard not to notice, I think?  
**Mai:** Oh no, I'm sorry. I just got carried away.  
**Kanami:** It's alright. I almost never get to see you like this, after all.  
**Mai:** Eh?  
**Kanami:** You're usually so calm and composed, and it feels like you can do anything. But seeing you act like this is pretty cute too. Right, Mihono-chan?  
**Mihono:** Yeah, I feel like my image of Yanase-san changed a little\!  
**Mai:** Eh... Really...?  
**Kanami:** Hey, do you want to try this again, Mai-chan? I'll sample it as much as you want. You'll join in too, right, Mihono-chan?  
**Mihono:** Yeah, if you'll let me, I'll try some anytime. Today's was good too\! I mean it; it was really yummy\!  
**Mai:** Asakura-san, Kanami-chan...  
**Mai:** Thank you. I'm so glad I had you two taste it.  
**Mai:** I'm a little depressed, but I'll keep on trying... I'll challenge it again, I promise\!  
**Kanami:** Yeah\! I'm looking forward to it. But if you mess up, that's okay. It just means we get to eat even more\!  
**Mihono:** I think I'd be happy with that too?  
**Mai:** Geez, cut it out, you two. Next time I'll get it right for sure\! ...Fufu.  

## 2: What is Femininity?
**Mai:** What should I do with these? I made too many cookies. Kanami-chan would be able to eat them all, but... She isn't back yet.  
**Kiyoka:** Thank goodness, I got this month's edition. I have to get back to my room and read the latest report-  
**Mai:** Eh\!\?  
**Kiyoka:** Kyaa\!  
*the two collide*

  
**Mai:** Oww... S-Sorry. I was lost in thought.  
**Kiyoka:** No, I wasn't looking where I was going...\! I'm so sorry\!\!  
**Mai:** Um, you're Musumi-san, right? Are you hurt? This magazine... It's yours, isn't it? Here.  
**Kiyoka:** Thank you so much\! And I really am sorry. You're... Yanase-san, aren't you?  
**Mai:** Yes. From Minoseki.  
**Kiyoka:** Ahhhh\!\! Yanase-san, when I bumped into you just now, did those...\!\?  
**Mai:** Oh my. The cookies... They got crushed, didn't they? But please, don't worry about it.  
**Kiyoka:** I'm so sorry, were they a present from someone? I'll buy you replacements.  
**Mai:** Oh, these are just something I made myself. Really, it's not worth fussing over.  
**Kiyoka:** Eh\!\? You mean those are handmade\!\? They look so cute...  
**Mai:** They might be a little broken, but would you like to try them?  
**Kiyoka:** Can I\!\?  
**Kiyoka:** These are delicious...\! Can you share the recipe with me, Yanase-san?  
**Mai:** Recipe? ...I don't really use them. I just go with what feels right when I'm cooking.  
**Mai:** More importantly, Musumi-san, there's crumbs getting on your magazine...\! Here, lay this handkerchief on top of it.  
**Mai:** Ah, that's right. Take a tissue as well, so you can wipe your hands.  
**Kiyoka:** ...You're so feminine, Yanase-san.  
**Mai:** Eh?  
**Kiyoka:** I'm jealous...\! I could never be so considerate, and cooking without a recipe would just be impossible for me...  
**Mai:** It's not like that. Baking things is just my hobby. When I'm cooking, I can really lose myself in it, and when I'm done, I like seeing others enjoy it.  
**Mai:** What about you, Musumi-san? What do you do in your spare time?  
**Kiyoka:** Eh, me...? Reading, is about all I do.  
**Mai:** Reading? What kind of books do you read?  
**Kiyoka:** L-Love stories, mostly. And, I read magazines... Like this one.  
**Mai:** Is that so. Let me see... "The Number 1 Must Buys This Season, Introducing Kamo Chinami's Mix and Match Technique"...  
**Kiyoka:** This report is always so handy. If you pick out whatever appears in here, it can make any outfit look cuter.  
**Kiyoka:** It's a big help in picking out accessories, for example, or, i-if I ever go on a date, what to wear...  
**Mai:** R-Really? Musumi-san, you seem so... Mature.  
**Kiyoka:** Eh....? Yanase-san, are you not interested in this kind of thing?  
**Mai:** I-I never really thought about it much.  
**Kiyoka:** I don't know that much about it myself. I just think, whenever I'm going out, that I should be a little fashionable. If someone ever thinks I'm cute, well...  
**Kiyoka:** That'd be wonderful.  
**Mai:** Somehow, I feel like... You're already pretty wonderful, Musumi-san. Talking to you like this, it's like you're sparkling.  
**Mai:** It's normal for girls to be interested in wearing cute clothes, isn't it? But I'm clueless when it comes to this...  
**Kiyoka:** In that case, Yanase-san\! I'll lend you this magazine\!  
**Mai:** Eh?  
**Kiyoka:** If you read it, I'm sure you'll feel much better about fashion. Think of it as a thank you for these cute cookies.  
**Kiyoka:** I really wish I could make you cookies like these as thanks, but it seems too difficult for me...  
**Mai:** Musumi-san... Thank you. But, isn't this this month's issue? You can give it to me after you're through reading it.  
**Mai:** Oh, before then... If you're interested, how about we bake cookies together next time?  
**Mai:** It doesn't have to be cookies either. We can make all sorts of cute sweets that'll get you all worked up.  
**Kiyoka:** Eh\!\? You don't mind me joining you?  
**Mai:** Of course not. When it comes to making sweets, I have some experience. And, next time...  
**Mai:** I'd like it if you shared with me some of your magazines.  
**Kiyoka:** That sounds great\! I'll bring all kinds with me\!  
**Mai:** Fufu. Then, until next time. It's a promise.  

## 3: As a Toji
**Chie:** Mihono-chan, Kiyoka-chan\! It seems like... We managed to deal with all the aradama.  
**Chie:** It's all thanks to the help of our reinforcement. I'm Setouchi Chie. And you are...?  
**Mai:** Yanase Mai, from Minoseki. I'm a classmate of Asakura-san... Of Mihono-chan.  
**Mihono:** You saved us-\! Thanks, Mai. That's Minoseki's tournament rep for you; you were awesome back there\!  
**Mihono:** Ahhh, oh yeah\! Musumi-san, are you okay?  
**Kiyoka:** Yes... Um, sorry, I'm just... I'm not very good at fighting...  
**Kiyoka:** Kya\! Another aradama\!  
**Chie:** Still...\!\? Yanase-san, our teammates should be returning any minute, so could you help us a little longer?  
**Mai:** Of course\!  
**Chie:** Minoseki's representative... I can see why. Even against those aradama, your posture never faltered, and your swordsmanship stayed clean.  
**Mihono:** See? I told you she's good, Chii-nee.  
**Mai:** Th-Thank you.  
**Mihono:** And, on top of that, she's a super rich girl. She's got a butler and everything\!  
**Kiyoka:** A butler... That sounds kind of amazing.  
**Kiyoka:** B-But wait, then why are you a toji? It's a dangerous position. For a high class girl like you...  
**Mihono:** You're right, it's a little weird. But being a toji is a really respectable position, isn't it? Maybe her family wanted her to do it or something.  
**Mai:** ...I decided to become a toji and worked towards it on my own.  
**Mai:** It's dangerous work, but it also keeps everyone safe. So I wanted to try it.  
**Mai:** Luckily, I was capable of using an okatana, and one of them accepted me.  
**Chie:** You sound so responsible. At least, I wouldn't expect that from a middle schooler.  
**Mihono:** Why're you looking at me, Chii-nee.  
**Kiyoka:** But, aren't you scared?  
**Mai:** I do get scared. Though, when I grip my okatana, all those feelings fade away.  
**Mai:** I train with that in mind, and somehow I manage.  
**Mihono:** That's so cool, Mai. It's like you have a totally different kind of strength than Kanami.  
**Chie:** You have to try your best too, Mihono-chan. Starting with your concentration... Right?  
**Mihono:** Ahaha... I need to work on that, huh...  

## 4: Late Night Cookies
**Mai:** Excuse me...  
**Mai:** Umm... Itomi Sayaka-chan...? I'm Yanase Mai, a second year middle schooler at Minoseki Academy. Could I talk to you for a little while...?  
**Sayaka:** ......  
**Mai:** Uh, well, I heard you fought with the runaway Kanami-chan and Juujou-san...  
**Sayaka:** ...They escaped. Because I lost.  
**Mai:** So Kanami-chan's safe... What a relief.  
**Mai:** ...Ah, s-sorry? I really shouldn't be saying that to you.  
**Sayaka:** ...It's just the truth that I lost.  
**Mai:** But isn't that why you're being confined to this room...?  
**Sayaka:** ...Because I failed my orders, after all.  
**Mai:** ......  
**Mai:** ...Sayaka-chan, there's a cut on your cheek.  
**Mai:** You really shouldn't leave that alone. Is it okay if I put a band-aid on it?  
**Sayaka:** Mm...  
**Mai:** There... That should do it. And, if you'd like, have some of these\!  
**Sayaka:** ...?  
**Mai:** I made too many cookies. Do you like sweets, Sayaka-chan?  
**Sayaka:** ...Mm. Ah, um, yes...  
**Mai:** Great. Then, I'd be happy if you had some.  
**Sayaka:** Happy...?  
**Mai:** Anyway, if they find me here, I'll get in trouble, so I'd better go now.  
**Mai:** Thank you for talking to me. I'll see you later.  
**Sayaka:** ...Mm...  
**Sayaka:** ......  
**Sayaka:** ...(crunch crunch).  
**Sayaka:** ...It's good.  

## 5: Are You Fine with That?
**Mai:** ...Sigh.  
**Hashima Ema:** Yanase-san.  
**Mai:** Ah... President?  
**Ema:** Those two will be alright.  
**Ema:** Though, of course you'd be worried. She's your best friend, after all.  
**Mai:** After what happened, there's been so much on my mind.  
**Mai:** I'm worried about Kanami-chan. At the same time, I'm sure if anyone can get through this, it's Kanami-chan.  
**Mai:** But...  
**Ema:** There's something else bothering you, isn't there?  
**Mai:** I just, don't know what to think anymore. How should I go on as a toji after this?  
**Mai:** I don't have Kanami-chan's pure love for swordfighting. I don't have the drive to get stronger like her.  
**Mai:** This may sound imprudent, but... I don't have the resolve Juujou-san must have had to turn her blade on Origami Yukari-sama either.  
**Mai:** Being a toji means keeping everyone safe, and I came this far because I thought of it as a commendable job.  
**Mai:** But... Is that really enough?  
**Ema:** I don't think there's anything wrong with you advancing through a sense of pride. But you're feeling uncomfortable with that now, aren't you, Yanase-san?  
**Ema:** Hmm, then... In that case, I think you're a little mistaken in what you said.  
**Mai:** In what I said?  
**Ema:** Truthfully, it's not about this being a commendable job, but because you wanted to become a toji who could protect others. And you're wondering if that desire alone is enough. Am I wrong?  
**Mai:** ...\!  
**Ema:** There are those with a deep love of swordfighting, and those who hide strong convictions. Comparatively, your desire might not seem like much. Not enough to risk your life over.  
**Ema:** If that's what's bothering you, I think I understand.  
**Mai:** ...You might be right. But, I'm not sure. I can't tell if what I aspired to be was simply because I thought it was praiseworthy.  
**Mai:** Seeing Kanami-chan and Juujou-san, I can't help but think I was being naive...  
**Mai:** I'm wondering, if I should really continue with this...  
**Ema:** Fufu. Don't worry.  
**Mai:** President...?  
**Ema:** I can't say for sure whether you should continue.  
**Mai:** You can't say...?  
**Ema:** That's right. However, don't belittle your desires. That's where all your strength is born from.  
**Ema:** Yanase-san. You don't have to rush. Collect your thoughts, and have faith in yourself. When the time comes, you'll clearly see the path you should follow again.  
**Ema:** With that, I need to leave for the night.  
**Mai:** President...  
**Mai:** ...I understand. I'll try having a little more faith in myself.

## [Misogi- Mai: Start]: My First Shock
--After being accepted to Minoseki Academy.

  
**Minoseki Academy Teacher:** Alright, this might be your first swordfighting lesson after entering Minoseki Academy, but...  
**Kanami:** I know\! I'm really excited for it\!  
**Mai:** (That girl, her name was... Etou-san, wasn't it? So she was looking forward to our swordfighting lessons that much...)  
**Minoseki Academy Teacher:** Looks like we've got a lively one with us. To start us off, we'll have you learn what your classmates are capable of.  
**Minoseki Academy Teacher:** You'll be fighting against everyone... But first, pair up with the person next to you\!  
**Kanami:** I'll be in your care, Yanase-san\!  
**Mai:** S-Sure, likewise.  
**Mai:** (We'll have to fight each of our classmates? Which would mean, I'll have to think about how to conserve my energy...)  
**Minoseki Academy Teacher:** Now then... Begin\!  
**Kanami:** ......  
**Mai:** (Wait, she's not attacking?)  
**Mai:** (That's sort of a let-down. With how she was acting, I thought she'd come straight at me as soon as we began...)  
**Kanami:** I'm ready anytime.  
**Mai:** (Her stance is... Seigan. It's so orthodox that there doesn't seem to be any scheme behind it. There's no need for tricks like that in our very first lesson anyway.)  
**Mai:** (In which case... I'll go\!)  
**Mai:** YAAAAH\!  
**Kanami:** -\!  
**Mai:** ...Eh\!\?  
**Mai:** (She dodged it... And so easily too...)  
**Kanami:** There's hardly any wasted movements... You love swordfighting too, don't you, Yanase-san\!  
**Kanami:** Show me more of your swordsmanship\!  
**Minoseki Academy Teacher:** That's enough\!  
**Mai:** Pant, pant...  
**Mai:** (I wasn't any match for her at all... Etou-san, just who are you...)  
**Kanami:** Yanase-san, you're so strong\!  
**Mai:** You too, Etou-san...  
**Kanami:** Just call me Kanami\!  
**Mai:** (There's somebody... This amazing here... Etou... Kanami...)  
**Mai:** Kanami-chan...  
**Kanami:** Yeah, Mai-chan\!  
**Mai:** -\!  
**Mai:** Etou... Kanami-chan...  
**Friend A:** Mai's been together with Kanami all the time lately, hasn't she?  
**Mai:** ...Eh?  
**Friend B:** Ah, I was thinking the same thing. Ever since that swordfighting lesson, right?  
**Friend A:** Well, Kanami was pretty amazing.  
**Mai:** Th-That's only because... See, Kanami-chan may be strong, but, don't you think she's unsafe in some ways? Like, she might prioritize swordfighting over her own well being...  
**Friend B:** You say that, but isn't the truth that you just wound up having a crush on her?  
**Mai:** I do not\!\! Don't go making assumptions like that\!\!  

## [Misogi- Mai: End]: The Name of This Feeling is Admiration
**Friend A:** Eh, Mai...?  
**Mai:** I-I'm sorry\! There's something the teacher asked me to take care of\!  
**Kanami:** ...  
**Mai:** ...Sigh.  
**Mai:** (Why did I get so upset when she said that... I'd better... apologize to her, shouldn't I...)  
**Mai:** (But... I don't understand it myself, why I reacted like that... I could tell right away she was only joking...)  
**Mai:** But, Kanami-chan...  
**Kanami:** You called?  
**Mai:** K-Kanami-chan\!\? Why are you...?  
**Kanami:** Actually... I saw what happened before. And then, I followed you here.  
**Kanami:** If it's alright with you, you can talk it over with me, okay?  
**Mai:** ...Thank you, Kanami-chan.  
**Kanami:** Why'd you get so mad? Can I ask you that?  
**Mai:** That's because...  
**Mai:** (I can't exactly tell her it's because they asked if I liked you, can I...)  
**Mai:** It was my fault. They were only teasing me a little, but I got seriously upset...  
**Kanami:** ...Was it because, they made fun of something important to you?  
**Mai:** Eh?  
**Kanami:** When I think, "If it were me, what would I get mad if someone made fun of?", it's got to be swordfighting of course\!  
**Mai:** Fufu, I could see that, Kanami-chan.  
**Mai:** (But then... That means, I got upset because Kanami-chan is important to me?)  
**Kanami:** And also... If somebody made fun of somebody you respect, you'd feel bad too, wouldn't you?  
**Mai:** Someone you respect... Yeah, respect\! That's it, Kanami-chan\!  
**Mai:** Thank you for letting me talk this over with you\!  
**Kanami:** Sure\! Wait, huh? Thinking back, I feel like I was the one doing all the talking...  
**Mai:** Still, that's fine\! I'm going to go apologize to them\!  
**Mai:** I'm sorry\!  
**Friend A:** No, we're the ones who should be saying sorry. We were being sort of insensitive.  
**Friend B:** We were. But, I didn't think that you actually did like Kanami... We'll do what we can to support you two, Mai\!  
**Mai:** Eh\!\? Th-That's not it\! You misunderstand\!  
**Friend A:** ...It's not?  
**Mai:** That's right. Kanami-chan, she's the first opponent I didn't think I could beat in swordfighting, so I respect her a lot.  
**Mai:** But, when you teased me about it... I think that's why I couldn't help but get angry all of a sudden.  
**Friend A:** So that's what it was. It happens, huh.  
**Mai:** We might be the same age, but... Kanami-chan was just so much stronger. That's why... Someday, I'd like to be about as strong as Kanami-chan.  
**Friend B:** She definitely is. We'll have to work real hard ourselves-.  
**Mai:** Mmhm\! Let's all work hard enough that we won't lose to Kanami-chan\!

## [Dress - Mai: Start]: Nene's Madness
**Kaoru:** Gulp, gulp, gulp... Phwaa\! Gimme another glass of grape juice\!  
**Nene:** Ne-\!  
**Mai:** Kaoru-chan, I think you've had enough grape juice...  
**Kaoru:** Don't stop me\! Cause you know, there's a life of taking the overnight bus north to south and back waiting for me ahead\!  
**Kaoru:** How'm I supposed to get through that without drinking this\!  
**Nene:** Nene\!  
**Mai:** Still...  
**Kaoru:** Hey, Mai... Have you ever rode on an overnight bus?  
**Mai:** I haven't...  
**Kaoru:** See? It's a place where you can never get a good sleep, you'll get woken up at every service area, your strength gets worn down hour after hour...  
**Mai:** Kaoru-chan... Are you drunk?  
**Kaoru:** Who gets drunk off grape juice\! But I can't make it if I don't drink\!  
**Mai:** I-I see.  
**Kaoru:** Ahh... It's good.  
**Kaoru:** This big piece of chicken too, and that roast beef I had before, they used some pretty high grade meat, right?  
**Nene:** Ne-?  
**Kaoru:** Nn? Nene, you want this meat? You can't, it's mine.  
**Nene:** Ne\!  
**Kaoru:** I'm the one who got it, so it's my meat\!  
**Nene:** Ne-...  
**Kaoru:** Anyway, that dress looks good on you, Mai.  
**Mai:** Thank you, Kaoru-chan. You look good in yours too.  
**Kaoru:** What, this? They didn't have many dresses in my size, y'know-.  
**Mai:** They didn't?  
**Kaoru:** Yeah. They had a whole bunch in the size just above mine though.  
**Nene:** NE--------\!  
**Mai:** Kyaa\!  
**Kaoru:** Nene stole my meat\!\?  
**Nene:** Ne\!  
**Kaoru:** Stop it, Nene\! That's my meat\!  

## [Dress - Mai: End]: Dress Close Call
**Kaoru:** Hey\! Gimme my meat back\!  
**Nene:** Ne-?  
**Mai:** K-Kaoru-chan, it's not that important...  
**Mai:** Ah, could you tell me which table you got that from? I'll get some more for you.  
**Kaoru:** That's not gonna work\! That was the last of the meat there\!  
**Mai:** Oh dear-...  
**Kaoru:** And Nene, he knew that, and he still went after my meat\!  
**Nene:** Nene-\!  
**Mai:** S-Still, if you want meat, there's plenty of other kinds laid out...  
**Kaoru:** But that's the last of that kind of meat\!  
**Mai:** Ah...  
**Kaoru:** Kukuku, I've got you cornered now, Nene...  
**Kaoru:** Okay, time to choose. You gonna give my meat back... Or aren't you? If you give it back now, I'll forgive you...?  
**Nene:** Nenenenenenenene\!  
**Kaoru:** Ah-\! You jackass, you ate it all in one go\!  
**Nene:** Ne?  
**Mai:** I think it's a little late to be playing innocent, Nene...  
**Kaoru:** You're getting it now, Nene\!  
**Nene:** Ne-\!  
**Mai:** Kyaa\!  
**Kaoru:** You dumbass\! Don't go jumping at Mai\!  
**Nene:** Ne\!\?  
**Kaoru:** We're safe... That was close. You know better than that; if you'd jumped on her just after eating, you'd get her dress dirty.  
**Nene:** Ne-...  
**Mai:** Thank you... Kaoru-chan. Nene-chan, I'll wipe your mouth for you.  
**Nene:** Ne-\!  
**Kaoru:** Can I leave Nene with you? I'm going to go get some meat.  
**Mai:** Sure, that's fine with me.  
**Kaoru:** Then, I'm off... This time, I'd better get some for Nene so he won't steal mine.  
**Mai:** ...So she says. Isn't that good for you, Nene-chan?  
**Nene:** Ne\!

## [Marching - Mai: Start]: Minoseki's Marching Band
**Mai:** Excuse me.  
**Ema:** I've been waiting to see you, Yanase-san.  
**Ema:** Actually, we've gotten a request for the Minoseki Academy's toji to perform in a marching band.  
**Mai:** A marching band... Like, one that plays wind instruments?  
**Ema:** Yes, that kind of marching band. And, that's where I'd like you to be the drum major... In other words, you'll be the conductor of the band.  
**Mai:** You want me to do that...?  
**Ema:** Yes. I think it would be a good experience for you. How do you feel about it?  
**Mai:** ......  
**Mai:** (A conductor... Can I really do it? I'm not so sure, but... the president must be suggesting this because she's sure I can.)  
**Mai:** ...Alright then. I'll take on the role of the drum major\!  
**Mai:** So now, we'll begin practicing.  
**Mai:** ......  
**Kanami:** (Here I do it like this, and then like this... Okay\!)  
**Mihono:** (Here's where I move over here...)  
**Nagae Futaba:** Hey\!\?  
**Mihono/Futaba:** UWAH\!\?  
**Futuba:** Why'd you run into me-\!\?  
**Mihono:** S-Sorry-\!  
**Mai:** Are you okay, Mihono-chan, Nagae-san\!\?  
**Mihono:** I'm fine. And anyway, sorry, Mai. I screwed up again.  
**Mai:** It's alright; we still have time. I'll stick with you, so let's practice lots, okay?  
**Mihono:** Sure\!  
**Mai:** That's enough practicing for today. You did great, everyone\!  
**Everyone:** Good work-\!  
**Mihono:** Ahh, I'm beat\! Let's go get something sweet to eat, Mai, Kanami\!  
**Kanami:** Yeah, okay.  
**Mai:** Ah, sorry, Mihono-chan. I have something to take care of...  
**Mihono:** Oh... That's too bad.  
**Kanami:** We'll see you tomorrow then, Mai-chan\!  
**Mai:** Sure\!  
**Mihono:** Wanna come too, Futaba-?  
**Futaba:** I'll pass\!  
**Mai:** Everyone's gone, so now I need to do my own practice.  
**Mai:** ......  
**Mai:** (They're all practicing their hardest. I have to try even harder too\!)  
**Mai:** --I messed up\! I won't make it like this... One more try\!  
**Mihono:** Ughh, I messed up a bunch, Kanamiii. I made a lot of trouble for Mai too.  
**Kanami:** But still, you've gotten a lot better, Mihono-chan.  
**Mihono:** You think so\!\?  
**Kanami:** Yeah\!  
**Mihono:** Then, that's good to hear\! She's taught how to do a whole lot, so I want to make sure the main performance is a success for sure.  
**Kanami:** Mai-chan's trying so hard for this. I'm sure she's probably practicing right now too.  
**Mihono:** ...Ah, if she's teaching me this stuff, that must mean she practiced it enough to learn it that well herself.  
**Mihono:** ...Sorry, Kanami\! I'm going to go back and practice with Mai too\!  
**Kanami:** I had a feeling you'd say something like that\! I'll go with you.  
**Mihono:** Okay\!  

## [Marching - Mai: End]: What They Saw
At the marching band's main performance.

  
**Mai:** ......  
**Kanami:** Mai-chan?  
**Mai:** Ah, Kanami-chan...  
**Kanami:** Feeling nervous?  
**Mai:** ...Just a bit.  
**Kanami:** It'll go fine.  
**Mai:** You're right. Everyone tried so hard during practice, after all...  
**Kanami:** That's why we'll definitely pull this off.  
**Mai:** ...  
**Mai:** How can... you be so sure?  
**Kanami:** That's cause everybody knows by now. Just how much effort you've been putting into this.  
**Mai:** How much I have...?  
**Kanami:** Yeah. You've been trying so hard that it made everybody else work even harder.  
**Mai:** They did...  
**Kanami:** That's why I just know this'll go great. So let's have fun with it\!  
**Mai:** Okay\!  
**Fukuda Sawano:** (There's so many people here to watch. Though, if we just do it like we practiced...)  
**Futaba:** (Yeah, yeah, all that practice is paying off\!)  
**Mihono:** (Here's where I have to not bump into Futaba... Okay\!)  
**Kanami:** (You can really tell how much everybody practiced\! I'm not about to let them show me up either\!)  
**Mai:** (That's amazing...\! Everyone's performance is even better than what they could do in practice\!)  
**Mai:** Nice work, everyone\! Our performance was fantastic\!  
**Mihono:** That was so nerve-wracking\!  
**Futaba:** So many people came to see us\!  
**Sawano:** It looked like they were even broadcasting it online.  
**Mihono:** Ehh\!\?  
**Kanami:** Mai-chan, everybody sent you messages.  
**Mai:** Eh? Ah, you're right\! I got a message from Sayaka-chan saying, "That was great."  
**Mai:** And there's ones from Ellen-chan and Kaoru-chan and everyone too... Fufu.  
**Kanami:** See, I told you we'd pull it off.  
**Mai:** You did, Kanami-chan\!

## [Swimsuit 20 - Mai: Start]: Am I Being... A Bit Overly Helpful?
**Mai:** Sayaka-chan. Are you getting things ready for tomorrow? If you'd like, I can help you?  
**Sayaka:** I got ready yesterday. I put what I needed in my bag, just in case.  
**Mai:** Sayaka-chan, that's great\!  
**Sayaka:** I also made sure to put in my swimsuit and a change of clothes. Should I bring a swim ring too?  
**Mai:** If you want one to go down the river, it sounds like the campsite will rent them to you, so I think you'll be fine without.  
**Mai:** It'll be easier for you if you have less to bring along.  
**Mai:** (I can't help myself from wanting to look after Sayaka-chan, but since she's a serious girl, she can at least get the preparations done on her own.)  
**Sayaka:** Then, I won't bring it. I'm really looking forward to tubing down the river tomorrow. I want to do it with you.  
**Mai:** Mm, let's do it together. I'm sure it'll be fun and feel great.  
**Sayaka:** And also, I'm looking forward to eating your cooking at the camp. I might not eat breakfast before we leave.  
**Mai:** You should at least eat breakfast before we go. Though, I'm glad to hear you're excited for my cooking.  
**Sayaka:** Okay, I will. What will you make?  
**Mai:** Since Chie-san is going along with us, I talked with her, and we'll basically be doing a barbecue.  
**Mai:** We can't do anything too elaborate with it, after all.  
**Mai:** I think you'll have fun and it would be even tastier if you try barbecuing some meat and vegetables yourself, Sayaka-chan.  
**Sayaka:** I don't know how to cook... But, I'll try it.  
**Mai:** You'll be fine. I'll be there with you, and I know you can do it.  
**Mai:** And then, we also talked about using a big iron plate and making enough yakisoba for everyone.  
**Mai:** So long as we bring noodles, we can make it with the ingredients from the barbecue.  
**Sayaka:** ......  
**Sayaka:** ...From talking about food, I started feeling a little hungry.  
**Mai:** I know what you mean. Talking like this makes you feel hungry, doesn't it?  
**Mai:** But, it's probably best if you don't eat this late.  
**Sayaka:** Mm... I'll hold off. I have to brush my teeth soon.  
**Mai:** In that case, I'll be going back to my room.  
**Sayaka:** I'll see you tomorrow. Goodnight, Mai.  
**Mai:** Mmhm, goodnight.  
**Sayaka:** Ah... Wait.  
**Mai:** Hm? What is it?  
**Sayaka:** Tomorrow... If you can, I want you to call me when you wake up... I'm not sure I can wake up on my own.  
**Sayaka:** ...Is that okay?  
**Mai:** That's fine. I'll give you a call. And, if that doesn't wake you up, I'll come get you up myself.  
**Sayaka:** Please do that. Thanks.  

## [Swimsuit 20 - Mai: End]: Swim Ring Tubing\!
**Mihono:** That was good-. Why is it that meat tastes so much better eating under a big blue sky?  
**Mihono:** Ah, and of course, the yakisoba you and Mai made was really yummy too, Chii-nee\!  
**Chie:** I'm glad you liked it. Ah, Mihono-chan. If you want to go play, you have to wait a little after you eat, alright?  
**Mihono:** I know that much-\!  
**Mai:** What did you think, Sayaka-chan? How was the meat you cooked yourself?  
**Sayaka:** It was tasty. But, I wasn't sure how much to grill it at first, so I burnt some.  
**Mai:** I know what you mean. There were times I burned things when I first started cooking. I was worried I might undercook it.  
**Sayaka:** You did it too, Mai? I want to try doing this again. With Kaoru next time.  
**Mai:** It would be nice to come again when Kaoru is free.  
**Mai:** Now that we've eaten, why don't we take a short break and then go to the river?  
**Mai:** It seems like there's places where the river hardly flows at all, and you can just leisurely float along.  
**Sayaka:** That sounds like Kaoru would like it.  
**Mai:** That's true. If Kaoru-chan were here, I could see her relaxing with Nene-chan.  
**Sayaka:** Tubing on the river. I was looking forward to it so much, after we finished talking last night, I couldn't fall asleep right away. I want to hurry and do it.  
**Mai:** Kyaaaa\!  
**Sayaka:** Just then\! The water was moving a little faster...\!  
**Mai:** Y-Yeah. There's a pretty big difference in speed at some points of the river, isn't there.  
**Sayaka:** Sometimes it slows down, and sometimes it speeds up a little\!  
**Mai:** Mmhm... It's like a ride at an amusement park...\!  
**Sayaka:** It's really... fun\!  
**Mai:** When the water splashes you, it feels nice and cool.  
**Sayaka:** Wahh-\!\?  
**Mai:** Are you alright, Sayaka-chan\!\?  
**Sayaka:** I'm fine. The swim ring just started sinking a little.  
**Mai:** Ah... You scared me.  
**Mai:** Oh, the tubing attendant is there. It looks like that's the end.  
**Sayaka:** ......  
**Mai:** Hey, Sayaka-chan? Do you want to go one more time? Tubing back down the river.  
**Sayaka:** I was just thinking I wanted to go again.  
**Sayaka:** Mai... You're amazing.  
**Mai:** Fufu. But Sayaka-chan, that's because your face is saying you wanted to do it even more.  
**Mai:** Besides, I had a lot of fun doing it too.

## [Stage Girl - Mai: Start]: Two Triangles
**Kanami:** I can't wait to spar with all these stage girls\! If I pass this up, I'll never get another chance like it.  
**Kanami:** Honestly, ever since we came here and I saw them fighting aradama, I've wanted to spar with them-.  
**Mai:** You said the same thing back when you first saw Hiyori-chan at the tournament, didn't you, Kanami-chan.  
**Kanami:** Ehehe.  
**Hiyori:** You did? Though it sounds just like something you'd do.  
**Kanami:** Ah, Hiyori-chan. What's up?  
**Hiyori:** What do you mean, "What's up?" You're the one who said to meet here so we could spar now.  
**Kanami:** Oh yeah\! Then, let's get right to it\! I'll catch up with you later, Mai-chan\~.  
**Mai:** Okay. Be sure not to get hurt, you two.  
**Mai:** ......  
**Mahiru:** Mai-chan?  
**Mai:** Tsuyuzaki-san? Did you need something?  
**Mahiru:** Nothing in particular, but, I was watching you with Kanami-chan. You seem close.  
**Mai:** We sure are. As soon as we met in middle school, we were fast friends. We spend lots of time together, in classes and in the dorms.  
**Mahiru:** Just like Karen-chan and I. Since the start of high school, we've always been together as roommates\! Though now there's three of us, since Hikari-chan moved in.  
**Mahiru:** What about Hiyori-chan? Her uniform is different, so she's from a different school, isn't she?  
**Mai:** We got to know Hiyori-chan during an incident at the tournament in our second year, and we've been friends ever since.  
**Mai:** It all started with Kanami-chan befriending Hiyori-chan.  
**Mahiru:** So that's what happened.  
**Kanami:** Mai-chaaan, Tsuyuzaki-saaan\! There's some aradama, so come over here\!  
**Mai:** We should go.  
**Mahiru:** Okay\!  
**Aradama:** GGGIIII\!  
**Mai:** Tsuyuzaki-san, one of the aradama went that way\! Could you get it\!  
**Aradama:** GGIIIII\!  
**Mahiru:** It's a little... scary, but I'll do it\!  
**Mahiru:** EIIIIIII\!\!  
**Mahiru:** There\! Home run\!  
**Mahiru:** It looks like we just finished cleaning up the aradama too.  
**Mai:** The aradama's really gone... You're incredible, Mahiru-san.  
**Mahiru:** It sort of looked like a ball, so I just gave it a good whack on reflex.  
**Mai:** That was only by reflex...?  
**Mai:** And not just that, but how you casually twirled around that weapon of yours like a baton as you fought...  
**Mai:** The way you moved... I think I could use it as reference in future fights.  
**Mahiru:** It's sort of embarrassing hearing you talk like that, Mai-chan.  
**Mahiru:** But, would it really be helpful learning from me?  
**Mai:** I'd like to give it a try. Will you teach me how?  
**Mahiru:** Mmm, but even if I teach you how to twirl a baton, it's not very useful for fighting, is it? I just somehow make it work...  
**Mahiru:** I know\! Mai-chan, could we try training like we're really fighting?  
**Mai:** Of course, if that's alright with you.  
**Mahiru:** Then, let's do it over there.  
**Mahiru:** I love the shining stage, but I love seeing you shine even more. I want to dance with you forever, in a duet going round and round. 99th generation, Tsuyuzaki Mahiru.  
**Mai:** That line just now had such a stylish ring to it.  
**Mahiru:** Ehehe, thank you. It makes me happy, hearing you say that. I get the feeling we're sort of alike, Mai-chan.  
**Mai:** We're alike?  
**Mahiru:** But we can talk about that after\!  
**Mahiru:** Fighting might be more of your specialty, but come try me, Mai-chan\!  
**Mai:** Here I come\!  
**Mahiru:** Ah, but I would appreciate it if you'd go a little easy on me after all.  

## [Stage Girl - Mai: End]: I Love Seeing You Shine Even More
**Mahiru:** Phew... I worked up a good sweat.  
**Mahiru:** How was that? I hope it was helpful getting to see it up close at least.  
**Mai:** It was. Though, I don't know if I'll be able to put it into practice straight away.  
**Mahiru:** It would be difficult to use your okatana the same way I use my weapon, wouldn't it.  
**Mai:** I think it's incredible enough that you can use that weapon like a baton, Tsuyuzaki-san\!  
**Mahiru:** You keep flattering me so much, Mai-chan\~.  
**Mai:** Ah, by the way. Before we started training, you told me the two of us were alike?  
**Mahiru:** Yeah, about that. I sort of had the feeling that the relationship between you, Kanami-chan, and Hiyori-chan was similar to us.  
**Mahiru:** I told you earlier, but, I'm roommates with Karen-chan, and I love her and we've always been together.  
**Mahiru:** But then... When we were in our second year of high school, Hikari-chan, Karen-chan's childhood friend, transferred in.  
**Mai:** Now that you say that, it does feel a little alike.  
**Mahiru:** At the time... I felt like Hikari-chan was stealing Karen-chan away from me... I felt really anxious for a while...  
**Mahiru:** That's why, I know I'm being a busybody, but I was kind of worried about how things are for you.  
**Mai:** Thank you for your concern. Though, I'm fine. Kanami-chan and Hiyori-chan are both close friends of mine.  
**Mahiru:** I'm glad to hear it. Sorry, for asking you something so weird.  
**Mai:** Not at all.  
**Mahiru:** Ahh, even though I'm the older one here, I'm acting kind of presumptuous. You really feel more reliable, Mai-chan.  
**Mai:** That's not true; I'm still working on that myself.  
**Mai:** Since we came to this world, you've worried about the troubles we're having more times than I can remember.  
**Mai:** You're like our reliable big sister.  
**Mahiru:** Well, I am a big sister. I have a little sister and brother at home. Maybe it's because of them, but I always find myself wanting to help others.  
**Mai:** Ah, I have two little sisters myself.  
**Mahiru:** We're the same\~.  
**Mahiru:** I don't mind going out of my way to help people, or I guess I should say, I just feel like I need to do something.  
**Mahiru:** I used to help even more with Karen-chan in the past. Like helping her get out of bed in the mornings.  
**Mai:** I can't help myself from taking care of things for my friends either. Though, sometimes they say I'm being overprotective...  
**Mahiru:** Hmmm, but, if the person you're helping isn't bothered by it, isn't it alright?  
**Mai:** That's how I feel\!  
**Kanami:** Good work, you two-.  
**Karen:** Mahiru-chan, you sorta look like you're getting along with Mai-chan. What were you talking about?  
**Mahiru:** About how we tend to look after others, and how we're a little bit a like.  
**Hiyori:** Now that you mention it, you might be similar to each other.  
**Hikari:** But when it comes to looking after others, I think you overdo it some.  
**Mahiru:** If you could keep everything in order yourself, Hikari-chan, I wouldn't argue. Can you?  
**Hikari:** Nn...  
**Karen:** I want you to help with that, Mahiru-chan. Without you around, our room would look like a disaster zone.  
**Mahiru:** You and Hikari-chan should make sure to tidy up after yourselves, Karen-chan\~.  
**Kanami:** Hey, Mai-chan. I've got something I want to ask from you.  
**Mai:** Like what? I'm all ears.  
**Kanami:** I was eating the sweets Daiba-san made earlier. And I started wanting to have some of your cookies.  
**Kanami:** When we get back, could you make some for me...?  
**Mai:** Mm, I'll make you some.  
**Kanami:** Nice-, thanks-\!
