## 1: I Miss You
**Ellen:** Kaoru, you got to see Papa and Mama at their research lab recently, didn't you\? They had a lot to say about you\! They were so happy to meet you\!  
**Kaoru:** Yeah\. They sure were something\. All full of energy\.  
**Ellen:** They're both so busy after all; they don't get a lot of free time to talk\.\.\. Mama especially said she's head over heels for you\!  
**Kaoru:** Huh\.  
**Ellen:** When it comes to engineering, Papa and Mama give even Grandpa a run for his money\!  
**Kaoru:** Ooh\.  
**Ellen:** You haven't met my grandpa yet, have you\? I want to show you how amazing he is already\!  
**Kaoru:** Ahh\.  
**Ellen:** \.\.\.Kaoru\.\.\.\? Are you listening\?  
**Kaoru:** I'm listening\. But you keep going on and on about your family\. I'm running out of reactions\.  
**Ellen:** Come on, don't be like that\! I love my family so much, so I want to share with you all about them\~\!  
**Kaoru:** I know, so I'll keep listening until you're satisfied, okay\?  
**Ellen:** That's what I love about you, Kaoru\!  
**Ellen:** Actually, I'm going on a trip with my family soon\! It's been a while since the whole Kohagura family got together\! I'm really looking forward to it\!  
**Ellen:** Papa and Mama said they're working extra hard to make sure they get time off for it\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** Oh\! Speaking of which, Mama's calling me now\! Mind if I take it\?  
**Kaoru:** Go ahead\.  
**Ellen:** Hi Mom\! I can't wait to see you\! \.\.\.  
**Ellen:** \.\.\.\.\.\.Ah\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.OK\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.  
**Ellen:** She said the trip had to be postponed\.  
**Kaoru:** I see\.  
**Ellen:** It's not all that surprising though\. Papa and Mama have so much to work on lately\. This happens a lot\.  
**Ellen:** In fact, it was a real miracle everyone's schedules managed to free up like that\! Like all the planets aligned\!  
**Ellen:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** But, it still hurts\.\.\. I wanted to see them\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** Still, I can't be selfish\.  
**Kaoru:** I don't think it's all that selfish\.  
**Kaoru:** Ah, c'mon\. Cheer up, Ellen\. How about instead, on the day you were supposed to go on a trip, I'll go along with you to your favorite cake buffet\?  
**Ellen:** Kaoru\.\.\. You're supposed to say \"you'll take me there\"-\!  
**Kaoru:** Fine, fine\. You can eat as much as you want\. Cause you're paying\.  

## 2: Cake Buffet
**Ellen:** We're here\.\.\. We're finally here\.\.\. The caaaaake buffet---\!  
**Everyone:** Yay-\!  
**Ellen:** The pure white cream, the light and fluffy texture, the bright and juicy fruits\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** Baked and non-baked, souffle and tarts, there's every cake you can imagine\! Let's charge right in, everyone\~\!\!  
**Kaoru:** Go get your fill\.  
**Kanami:** Eh\? Kaoru-chan, are you not having any\?  
**Kaoru:** I'll watch our seats\. Ellen\~, get some coffee for me\~\.  
**Kanami:** Ellen-chan already raced in ahead of everyone\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** Tch, too late, huh\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** Anyway, I'm going too-\!  
**Kaoru:** Ah, hey\! That's where you're supposed to say \"Then, I'll get your coffee for you\~\"\!  
**Sayaka:** Can I\.\.\. Eat these\.\.\.\? Any of these\.\.\.\? All of these\.\.\.\?  
**Mai:** Mmhm, it's fine\. Eat whichever you like\.  
**Sayaka:** \.\.\.\! \.\.\.I can't choose\.\.\.  
**Mai:** Fufu\. Then, how about we pick out different types\? We can taste each other's later\.  
**Hiyori:** Who would even want to eat all these sweets to begin with\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** Hiyori-chan\! There's a chocolate mint cake over here\!  
**Hiyori:** What\!\?  
**Kanami:** We're back-\! Time to eat-\!  
**Kanami:** Whoa\!\? Ellen-chan's surrounded by an army of cakes\!  
**Ellen:** No, no\~\! I've maneuvered this army right where I want them\!  
**Hiyori:** There's no way someone could that much, is there\.\.\.\?  
**Ellen:** A piece of cake\! I could have this before breakfast\!  
**Kaoru:** She's probably gonna go back two or three times for more\.  
**Mai:** Th-That's really something\.\.\.  
**Sayaka:** \.\.\.Mai\. Did we not get enough\.\.\.\?  
**Mai:** N-No, we're fine\. I think that would be too much for even the two of us together\.  
**Ellen:** Everyone's ready, right\? So we can start eating\? Come on, hurry\! Three, two\.\.\.\!  
**Everyone:** One-\!  
**Ellen:** Burp\.\.\.\.\.\. I-I ate too much\.\.\. I can't move\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** The cause of defeat was one helping too many\.  
**Ellen:** I thought I could at least finish one of everything\.\.\. My greed got the better of me\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** Still, I can't believe you ate all that\! You really love cakes, huh, Ellen-chan\~\?  
**Mai:** Just looking at the satisfaction on her face made me start feeling happier\.  
**Ellen:** I really enjoyed it too, of course\! Eating the cakes I love with the people I love; today I'm feeling 100% happy\!  
**Ellen:** \.\.\.Just, for a little bit\.\.\. Let me rest\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** Then I'll go get some cake and coffee\.  
**Kaoru:** They're probably putting out new cakes around now, in the wake of Ellen's rampage\~\.  
**Hiyori:** You mean\.\.\. Were you just waiting around knowing this would happen\.\.\.\?  

## 3: A Few Minutes of Vacation
**Kaoru:** Finally, we're in Izu\.   
**Nene:** Ne\~\!  
**Ellen:** And the weather's so nice\! Though it feels like we could be assigned a mission right away\.  
**Kaoru:** Since we're here and all, I wanna eat some of Izu's specialties\. Ellen, do you know any\?  
**Ellen:** I'll look some up on my phone\!  
**Ellen:** \.\.\.Let's see\.\.\. Izu has a lot of fishing ports, so it seems like they sell a lot of dried fish\.  
**Ellen:** They seem to have a lot of orange farms too\. They must love picking oranges\.  
**Kaoru:** That sounds nice\.  
**Ellen:** And then, they have a local delicacy called \"Deep-Fried Dick\", apparently\.  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.What's with that suggestive name\?  
**Ellen:** Seems like they mince up locally caught mackerel and squid, add vegetables like carrots, onions, and burdock, mix it all together, and fry it in oil\.  
**Kaoru:** Sounds delicious\.\.\. I wanna eat it, but it'll be embarrassing to order\.  
**Ellen:** You're lewd, Kaoru\.  
**Kaoru:** You're the one who said it first\.  
**Ellen:** I just said what it's called\~\.  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** Oh\! Sana-sensei's calling\! Hello, what is it\?  
**Ellen:** \.\.\.Eh\? An emergency assignment\? So Kanamin and Hiyoyon made it to Izu, and we're supposed to meet up with and test them\?  
**Kaoru:** Well there goes our Izu sightseeing tour\. Only got a few minutes out of it\.  
**Nene:** Ne\~\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** There's no helping it\. Accepting those two is more important than us getting a day off\.  
**Kaoru:** Oh yeah, so what about the investigation team\?  
**Ellen:** We just have to trust they can take care of themselves\.  
**Ellen:** We have to focus on our own mission, after all\.  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.Man\. After this is over, I want a long vacation\.  

## 4: Vision of the Future
**Ellen:** Hiii-\! Myaako-\! I'm stopping by\!  
**Sasano Miyako:** \.\.\.You again\. You sure come here a lot\.  
**Ellen:** Yes\! Is it okay if I check out some of the data from the research department\?  
**Miyako:** That's fine\. If you want to continue what you were reading last time, it's on the shelf over there\.  
**Ellen:** Thanks as always\!  
**Miyako:** \.\.\.Do you keep it a secret from your partner that you come here\?  
**Ellen:** Partner\? You mean Kaoru\?  
**Ellen:** I invite her every time, but of course she always refuses, saying it \"Sounds lame\~\"\.  
**Miyako:** I see\. But isn't that normal\?  
**Ellen:** I guess\? I think Kaoru gets a little abnormally annoyed with everything though\~\.  
**Miyako:** Well, you have a real passion for researching developments into new anti-aradama technology\.  
**Miyako:** Especially \"suppression methods that don't involve the use of toji\"\. I don't think many toji in active duty would have such an interest in that field\.  
**Ellen:** \.\.\.  
**Miyako:** Do you really hate fighting that much\? Or does this\.\.\. Have something to do with Mokusa\?  
**Ellen:** \.\.\.Myaako\. No matter how alone we are, that's being too careless\.  
**Miyako:** You're right\. I'm sorry\.  
**Ellen:** I'm really glad I could be a toji\. I have the strength to keep everyone safe and happy, after all\.  
**Ellen:** But a toji's power doesn't last forever\. I won't always be able to go on like this\.  
**Ellen:** So when my power fades, I want to take the path of an engineer like my esteemed papa and mama\.  
**Ellen:** With an okatana now, and with technology someday\. That's how I'll always be able to continue fighting to protect people\!  
**Ellen:** Coming here is just laying the groundwork for that\. So if I had to say, my research here is for my own benefit\.  
**Miyako:** \.\.\.That's unexpected\. I didn't think you considered those things\.  
**Ellen:** It's the first time I've told anyone about it too\! I'm feeling sort of embarrassed\.\.\.  
**Miyako:** Really\? I see you in a different light now\.  
**Ellen:** Ooh\! If it made Myaako fall for me all over again, then it was worth revealing\.  
**Ellen:** Though, saying all that, no one knows what could happen in the future\.  
**Ellen:** It might be that, somehow, I end up being the first ever lifetime toji, you know\!  
**Miyako:** Who can say\.  
**Miyako:** \.\.\.By the way, there were some interesting results in yesterday's incident report\. Want to take a look\?  
**Ellen:** Of course\!  

## 5: The Fighting Toji-san
**Kagami Mimi:** Ah, it's Ellen\~\! Ellen, Ellen, Ellen\~\!  
**Ellen:** Wow, Mimimin\! Are you done studying for the day\?  
**Mimi:** Yeah\! All done\~\! Hey, Ellen, will you play with me again today\?  
**Ellen:** Sure thing\~\! What'd you have in mind\?  
**Mimi:** Awesome-\! I thought we could play samurai-\!  
**Ellen:** But you're so strong, Mimimin-\! Last time I was defeated\.\.\. But this time, I'll show you my true power\!  
**Mimi:** Ahaha\! You always say that, but you always end up losing\!  
**Ellen:** Fufufu\.\.\. Don't make the mistake of comparing me to last time\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** ---\!  
**Ellen:** (My spectrum finder picked something up\.\.\. It's right near the school\.\.\.\)  
**Ellen:** Sorry, Mimimin-\! Seems like I have some toji work to do\. We can settle this later, okay\?  
**Mimi:** Ehh-\!\?  
**Mimi:** Ah, then I'll go with you\! With both of us together, we can beat that aradama in no time\!  
**Ellen:** That's a great idea\. But this is work for your onee-san\. It's still a bit too early for you, Mimimin\.  
**Ellen:** The aradama's close by, so don't leave the school\. Promise me that, okay\?  
**Mimi:** 'Kay\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** Then, I'm going\! I'll be right back-\!  
**Mimi:** \.\.\.But that's so boring\. I figured Ellen would have said it's fine for me to go\.\.\.  
**Mimi:** I know\~\. I'll sneak out and beat the aradama\.  
**Mimi:** She said not to, but I bet Ellen'll be so surprised and praise me a lot\~\!  
**Mimi:** \.\.\.Ah, Ellen's over there\! Which means that bad aradama must be around too\.\.\.  
**Mimi:** \.\.\.Eh\?  
**Aradama:** GRURURUUUU\.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Mimi:** \.\.\.A-Ah\.\.\. No, don't come near me\.\.\.\!  
**Ellen:** Mimimin\!\!  
**Mimi:** Ah\.\.\. Ellen\.\.\.\!  
**Ellen:** Hide behind me\. I won't let it hurt you\.  
**Ellen:** \.\.\.\.\.\.Phew\. Mimimin, did you get hurt\?  
**Mimi:** N-No\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** Didn't you hear me say not to come\?  
**Mimi:** \.\.\.\! Sor-I'm sorry\.\.\.\!  
**Mimi:** I do so good in practice, so I thought I could fight already\.\.\. But I couldn't move a muscle\.\.\.  
**Mimi:** I'm sorry, Ellen\. Sorry I broke my promise\. Please don't hate me\.\.\.\!  
**Ellen:** Don't cry, Mimimin\. I could never hate you\.  
**Ellen:** I was just really worried\. I'm glad you're safe\.  
**Mimi:** \.\.\.You're an amazing toji, Ellen\.\.\. You looked so cool when you were fighting\.  
**Ellen:** Didn't I tell you, Mimimin\? That I'd show you my true power\~\.

## [New Year's Ellen: Start\]: Hanetsuki Competition\!
**Kanami:** The crowd of people here for their first shrine visit sure is huge\.  
**Ellen:** But it's also a part of the season here in Japan\. It's fun waiting around in all the commotion\.  
**Kaoru:** And here I thought I'd get to laze around at home through New Year's-\.  
**Nene:** Nene-\!  
**Sayaka:** Mai\.\.\. You don't have to hold my hand anymore\. I won't get lost\.  
**Mai:** Ah, that's right\. Sorry, I've been holding on all this time\.  
**Sayaka:** It's okay\.\.\. Your hand was warm\.  
**Kanami:** Hey, Hiyori-chan, what'd you pray for\?  
**Hiyori:** To be in good health\. What about you\?  
**Kanami:** Well, to meet more strong toji this year\! That's what I wished for\.  
**Hiyori:** That sounds like something you'd do, but I guess there's nothing wrong with it\.  
**Ellen:** What should we do now\? We could draw fortune slips, or get sweet sake; or a whole bunch of things\!  
**Mai:** Since I'm here at the shrine, I thought I would buy some protective charms for my family, then bring them back home\.  
**Ellen:** That sounds nice too\. Hmm, I can't make up my mind\. Isn't there some kind of special event you do at New Year's\?  
**Kaoru:** It's not really an event, but what if we do that\?  
**Kanami:** Ah\! We could play hanetsuki\! 	[Hanetsuki is a game similar to badminton, traditionally played at New Year's\]  
**Ellen:** Looks like fun\! Let's do it\!  
**Hiyori:** I'll pass\. You can have fun on your--  
**Kaoru:** Don't you know, Eternal\? Playing hanetsuki is considered an act of prayer for a girl's development\.  
**Nene:** Ne\~\?  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.\!\!  
**Kaoru:** You sure you want to miss out\? I guess it's only just a prayer, after all-\.  
**Ellen:** So then, Kanamin and I will be playing\?  
**Hiyori:** Wait, I'm playing too\.\.\.\!  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.\.\.\.Heh\.  
**Kanami:** If Hiyori-chan feels like playing, then I'll be the referee\.  
**Sayaka:** \.\.\.What will you do, Mai\?  
**Mai:** Let's see\.\.\. I'll go pick out protective charms while I still can\. If I let too much time go by, I think it'll be too crowded\.  
**Sayaka:** Then, I'll go too\.  
**Mai:** Okay\. Let's get going then\. We're going to go buy some charms for a bit, okay\?  
**Kanami:** Ah, alright\! We'll see you later, Mai-chan, Sayaka-chan\.  
**Ellen:** Getting to compete with Hiyoyon like this is making me excited\. I'm not about to lose, okay-\?  
**Hiyori:** I don't plan on losing either\.  
**Kaoru:** You can do it-\. 'Cause I'll be cheering for you-\.  
**Ellen:** Kaoru, please cheer for me too-\!  
**Kaoru:** Yeah, you can do it too, Ellen-\.  
**Kanami:** Give it your best shot, you two\~\!  
**Ellen:** Hiyoyon, here I go-\? Let's start\! There-\!  

## [New Year's Ellen: End\]: Fun Together\!
**Hiyori:** HA-\!  
**Ellen:** Not bad, Hiyoyon\! HO-\!  
**Kanami:** That's crazy\! They've been going for so long now\. Other people who came to the shrine are starting to watch too\.  
**Kaoru:** Yep, that's Hiyori alright\. It's like she's becoming one with the hagoita\. [Flat paddle used in hanetsuki\]  
**Hiyori:** Kaoru\.\.\. Could you\.\.\. Shut up-\!  
**Ellen:** How about this\? HA-\!\!  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.Kh\!  
**Kanami:** That settles it; Ellen-chan's the winner\.  
**Ellen:** I did it\! Hanetsuki's pretty fun\~, isn't it\.  
**Kaoru:** As a rule, you're supposed to draw on the loser with black ink, but we haven't got any\. Too bad\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** That reminds me, did you know about this\?  
**Ellen:** The hagoita is a tool you use for hanetsuki, but, a long time ago, it seems like it was customary to give them to girls on New Year's, as a charm to ward off misfortune\.  
**Kanami:** Huh-, so hagoita used to be used like that\.  
**Ellen:** So, Kanamin and Kaoru, are you going to be playing next\?  
**Kaoru:** Nah, I'm good\.  
**Kanami:** Ehh-\. Kaoru-chan-, come on-\.  
**Kaoru:** Visiting a crowded shrine like this takes way more out of you than I expected\. That's why, I've got to preserve my stamina, just in case\.  
**Kanami:** Ah, then to make up for it, we can have a match together some other time\! Then I can spar against you, Kaoru-chan\! Would that work\?  
**Kaoru:** Oi, why do we have to make up for it\.\.\. Fine, I'll think about it\. But only think about it\.  
**Mai:** We're back\. Are you all taking a break\?  
**Hiyori:** Yeah\. Or, actually, we might be done now\.  
**Sayaka:** You're done\.\.\. playing hanetsuki\?  
**Ellen:** If you two feel like playing, then we can keep going\. What do you think, Saaya\?  
**Sayaka:** I'm\.\.\. fine with not playing\.  
**Mai:** I agree, I think I'm fine not playing too\.  
**Ellen:** In that case, next up, should we all go draw our fortune slips for the year\?  
**Kanami:** Ellen-chan, let's go check out the food stands after that\!  
**Ellen:** I was just thinking the same thing, Kanamin\! You and I are on the same page\.  
**Sayaka:** Me too\.\.\. I'm looking forward to the food stands\.  
**Kanami:** Ehehe\. It's kind of nice, isn't it\? Doing this kind of thing\. I hope we can all have a lot more fun again this year-\.  
**Ellen:** Alll-right, let's all have another fun year together\!  

## [Summer Uniform - Ellen: Start\]: Meeting Up With Kaoru and Nene\~
**Kaoru:** Are you guys already getting into it-\?  
**Nene:** Nene\~\.  
**Ellen:** Kaoru\~\! I'm glad you made it\~\. Good work on your mission\.  
**Kaoru:** Getting R&R is something I specialize in, just as much as orders to wait on standby and break\.  
**Kaoru:** Actually, you guys haven't finished up the barbecue yet, have you\?  
**Ellen:** No problem\. We still have plenty of ingredients left-\. You and Nene can both eat your fill\.  
**Nene:** Ne-\!  
**Kaoru:** Ooh, you've got some pretty good meat here\. You really went all out\.  
**Ellen:** That's the beef that Mihomiho brought\. She said she used all her spending money\!  
**Kaoru:** Is that so\. Though, I'm not seeing Mihono herself around\?  
**Chie:** Mihono-chan and Kiyoka-chan are taking a little break after eating\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** Naonao, could you save the meat you're grilling now for Kaoru\?  
**Uraga Nao:** Sure thing\. The hard workers among us need to make sure to get enough nourishment\~\.  
**Kaoru:** The president must have me confused for a workhorse or something\. She doesn't even give me carrots either\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** We have carrots here\. Go on and eat up-\.  
**Kaoru:** No way; let me get some meat first\!  
**Ellen:** Fufu, I'm only joking\. Here you go, ready to eat\. You can have a drink too\.  
**Kaoru:** Ohh, I sorta feel bad making you getting everything for me\. Why're you doing all this anyway\?  
**Chie:** Isn't it simply that she's happy you're here, Kaoru-san\?  
**Ellen:** Hey, Chie-, don't tell her that-\.  
**Ellen:** You quit looking at me too, Kaoru\. Your meat's getting cold\.  
**Kaoru:** Then, I'll dig in\. --Ohm\!  
**Kaoru:** Sho good\.\.\.\!\? I've gotta give Mihono my thanks\.  
**Ellen:** That's the meat we all fought to get back from the aradama\. So go ahead and savor it\.  
**Kaoru:** You've been working hard too, huh\. [chew chew\]\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** I wish this kind of R&R would get turned into one of my duties too\.  
**Ellen:** That's for sure-\. We could all go have fun at lots of different places\.  
**Ellen:** Ah, you should try the ones she grilled slow at low temperature too\.  
**Kaoru:** I guess I'll have some of that then\.  
**Nene:** Nene-\!  
**Nao:** Not yet\~\. These ones need to cook a little longer\. Understand\~\?  
**Nene:** Ne\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** The barbecue boss's orders are absolute, Kaoru\.  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.R-Right\. Anyway, Mihono and Kiyoka still aren't back yet\?  
**Ellen:** They'll be back soon\. Let's all enjoy the barbecue while we wait for them\.  
**Kaoru:** Sounds like a plan-\. Ahh, this stuff really is good\.  

## [Summer Uniform - Ellen: End\]: After a Mission, You Take a Break\!
**Kaoru:** Having somebody else grill for you isn't bad, but you've gotta try barbecuing your own meat\.  
**Kaoru:** When it starts sizzling, the sound alone's enough to taste it\.  
**Nene:** Ne\~\.  
**Ellen:** That's definitely one way to enjoy it-\.  
**Kaoru:** The smell when it's grilling's good too\.  
**Ellen:** [yawn\]\.\.\. Nice weather and a full stomach\.\.\. I'm getting sleepy\.  
**Ellen:** Kohagura Ellen, now switching over to comfy mode\~\.  
**Kaoru:** Skewers are ready; you want one, Ellen\?  
**Ellen:**  Nnn\.\.\. Getting up's too much work\. I wonder if I caught this from you, Kaoru\?  
**Ellen:** Since we're always together, it must have only been a matter of time\.  
**Kaoru:** Don't blame me if you're turning into a slacker\. I'm the one wanting to slack off here\.  
**Kaoru:** So, you want one or don't you\?  
**Ellen:** What to do-\. You did go and grill it yourself, so\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** If you'll feed it to me, I'll gladly have one\. --Ahhhhn\.  
**Kaoru:** What're you talking about\.\.\. What are you, a baby bird\?  
**Ellen:** If I'm a baby bird, then you're the mama bird\.  
**Ellen:** You're good at looking after others, so you seem like you'd make a good mother, Kaoru\.  
**Kaoru:** I'm not so sure about that\. Here, it's hot, so be careful\.  
**Ellen:** Thank you\. You cooked it nicely\.  
**Kaoru:** It's not fun, but cooking's nothing much-\.  
**Ellen:** You really brought the flavor out, Kaoru\.  
**Kaoru:** Anybody could do it if they tried\.  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.Or maybe not\. The stuff Nao cooked was really good\.  
**Ellen:** [chew chew\]\.\.\. But, I like it this way\.  
**Kaoru:** Well, that's good to hear then\.  
**Kaoru:** Ahh\.\.\. Now that I've had my fill, I'm getting sleepy too\.  
**Ellen:** Want to take a nap with me\? They say \"a sleeping child is a growing child\"\.  
**Kaoru:** Don't you think you've already grown enough\?  
**Ellen:** Actually, I'm still in the middle of my growing phase\.  
**Nene:** Ne-\!\?  
**Kaoru:** You're gonna get even bigger\!\?  
**Kaoru:** So this's what they call a dangerously stratified society\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** But, back to what you were saying\. An afternoon nap doesn't sound too bad\. I wish I had the spare time to take one every day\.  
**Ellen:** Agreed\. Kaoru, don't go pushing yourself too hard, alright-\?  
**Kaoru:** You know that's not up to me-\. I'd do everything I can to get out of it\.  
**Kaoru:** Anyway, don't worry about me\. But thanks\.  
**Ellen:** Fufu, you don't have to thank me for it\. Just, no need to be shy with me\. Got it\?  
**Kaoru:** Sure\.

## [Casual '20 - Ellen: Start\]: The Pair's New Year's Eve
**Aradama:** GUOOOOO\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** They're still coming\? Oi, Aradama, could you at least take it easy on New Year's Eve\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** Kaoru, complaining to the aradama won't do you any good\. We're nearly through with this year's missions\. Let's give it one last push\!  
**Ellen:** I'm going in\! HAAAAAAAAAAAH\!  
**Aradama:** Keeeee\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** Alright, guess that's it for this year's slave labor\. Another long year jammed with work after work\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** Good job pulling through another year\! Or, that's what I'd like to say, but\.\.\. the spectrum finder is still picking something up\.  
**Kaoru:** Sigh\.\.\. Everybody else's already on their New Year's break, but we don't even get this or Obon off\.\.\.  
**Nene:** Nee\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** Kaoru, Nene, there's not much left to do, so let's try our best\! After this mission's over, there's my Papa and Mama's countdown party waiting for us\!  
**Kaoru:** Yeah, that's right\. The luxury party they rented out a huge room at a high class hotel for\.  
**Ellen:** With delicious food, and all the amazing sweets you could want\! So let's finish this mission quick, so we can make it in time for the party\.  
**Kaoru:** Well, it's true that, after all the work we've done, you'd want spend at least the very end of the year getting treated for it\.  
**Nene:** Ne-\!  
**Kaoru:** Sigh\.\.\. I can't do any more after this\. There can't be any more of them, right\?  
**Ellen:** You did great\! It seems we cleared out the aradama, so that means this year's missions are finally complete\!  
**Ellen:** If we race back to the party now, we should make it in time for the countdown\! Let's hurry\!  
**Kaoru:** Nobody's here\.\.\.  
**Nene:** Nee\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** Apparently the party ended while we were stuck in traffic\. Sorry to disappoint you, Kaoru\.  
**Kaoru:** Nah, it's fine\. This is just how things go for us cogs in the system\.\.\. It's actually the perfect New Year's for drones like us\. Come on, might as well go home and go to bed\.  
**Ellen:** Hold on a moment\! Over there, there's one table with food still laid out\!  
**Kaoru:** Ohh, you're right\! Don't tell me they left it for us\?  
**Ellen:** That's what it looks like\. There's a message card from Papa and Mama, and a New Year's Present too\.  
**Kaoru:** Present\? This envelope done up in a ribbon\? What's inside\?  
**Ellen:** It's a keycard\.  
**Kaoru:** A keycard\? And where does that get us into\?  
**Ellen:** Fufu\. That's something you can look forward to finding out later\!  
**Ellen:** Anyway, Kaoru, we might not have made it in time for the countdown, but let's celebrate New Year's\.  
**Ellen:** Let's start with a toast\! Kaoru, Nene, thanks so much for everything this past year\. I'm looking forward to spending the next year with you too\.  
**Ellen:** Cheers\!  
**Kaoru:** Fwah, I'm stuffed\. My stomach's too full to move anymore\.  
**Nene:** Nee\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** I'm glad it put you back in a better mood\!  
**Ellen:** I just got a message from Kanamin\. Wow\! So she and Hiyoyon went and did their first shrine visit\. Take a look, Kaoru; they look like they're having fun in this picture\.  
**Kaoru:** Hahah\.\.\. Those are some nice smiles\. Look at them, enjoying their New Year's break\.  
**Ellen:** There's more too\. \"We're going to the mountaintop now to see the first sunrise\. Do you and Kaoru-chan want to join us\?\"  
**Kaoru:** The first sunrise\.\.\. Sorry, but I'm dead after that mission, and, after eating that much, I don't have it in me to go out again\.  
**Kaoru:** Besides, I'm not even sure I can stay up till sunrise\. And there's just no way I'm climbing up a mountain and sitting in the cold until it comes up\.  
**Kaoru:** Seriously, the timing this year's been the worst right out the gate\.  
**Nene:** Nee\.  
**Ellen:** Come on and cheer up, Kaoru, Nene\. I've got a good idea\!  

## [Casual '20 - Ellen: End\]: The Happy New Year Plan
**Kanami:** Ellen-chan, Kaoru-chan, Happy New Year\!  
**Hiyori:** Leave it to Ellen to have a room at a fancy hotel like this for a party\.  
**Ellen:** Kanamin, Hiyoyon, thanks for coming\. And, Happy New Year to you too\.  
**Kaoru:** Oi, Ellen, it's great and all you called those two here, but we're already done with the food\.  
**Ellen:** I know\. Now that Kanamin and Hiyoyon are here, let's move on to the next attraction\!  
**Kaoru:** The next attraction\?  
**Ellen:** We'll take the keycard Papa and Mama left us and go someplace nice\!  
**Kanami:** Someplace nice\? Hiyori-chan, don't you want to go see\!  
**Hiyori:** Why not\. Since she asked us to call off our plans to see the sunrise, whatever it is must be something amazing\.  
**Ellen:** We're here\!  
**Kaoru:** And where's \"here\"\.\.\.\?  
**Ellen:** The members-only lounge on the hotel's top floor\! The sunrise you can see from up here is very beautiful\.  
**Hiyori:** So that's why\. It's hard to tell since it's still night out, but I'm sure a floor this high gets a good view of it\.  
**Kanami:** Thanks, Ellen-chan\! Now if it could only be sunrise already-\.  
**Ellen:** It's still going to take a while, so let's have some tea while we wait\! Here, Kaoru, some warm milk tea for you\.  
**Kaoru:** Fwahh\~, that's good stuff\. Sitting out in the cold until the sun came up wasn't gonna happen, but I feel like I could wait for hours like this\.  
**Kaoru:** The heater's working, the sofa's sucking me in\.\.\. Yawnn\.\.\. Getting sleepy\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** [snooze\.\.\.\]  
**Nene:** Nenee\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** Kaoru-chan fell asleep just sitting down, huh\.  
**Hiyori:** She must be tired, since she was working missions all the way to New Year's Eve\.  
**Ellen:** How about we let her sleep like this until the sunrise\.  
**Kaoru:** [sleepy breathing\.\.\.\]  
**Ellen:** Kaoru, wake up now\. The sun's just about to come up\.  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.Nn\? Feels like Ellen's voice is right in my ear\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** Ah-- I must've passed out on your lap at some point\.  
**Ellen:** Yes, you were sleeping like a baby\.  
**Ellen:** Kaoru, the sun's going to be coming up out the windows over there\. Let's go see\.  
**Kaoru:** Yeah, I'd love to go see it, but\.\.\. Between this cushy sofa and your lap, I'm feeling so cozy my body's refusing to get up\.  
**Nene:** Nee\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** Even while we're talking, I feel like I'm about to drift off again\.\.\. Sorry Ellen, for being like this first thing in the year\.  
**Ellen:** It's alright, Kaoru\. Even like this, you can still see out the window\.  
**Ellen:** Ah, looks like the sun is out\.  
**Kaoru:** You're right\. The morning sun's shining real bright\.  
**Ellen:** It's looking to be another good year\. Happy New Year, Kaoru\. Let's stay strong and give it our best this year too\.  

## [Ceremonial Dress Misogi - Ellen: Start\]: Let's Go On a Trip to Change the World\!
**Ellen:** Hmm, hm hm hm hmm\~\. Hm hmm hm hm hmm\~\! \.\.\.It's done\!  
**Ellen:** My Nene drawing is finished\! That's another one that turned out very cute\!  
**Ellen:** I'll show it to the people of the world right away\. \.\.\.Okay, it's uploaded\! Now to spread it on social media\.\.\. Wow\!  
**Ellen:** It's already getting comments\!  
**Comment 1:** \.\.\.A tanuki\?  
**Comment 2:** Maybe it's an extension cord\. That tail thing looks like it plugs in\.  
**Comment 3:** It's so crappy I can't tell what it's supposed to be\.  
**Ellen:** \.\.\.Oh, it's no good again\. Does it really look that bad\?  
**Ellen:** \.\.\.No, I can't go letting it get me down\! My art's going to show them aradama don't have to be scary\!  
**Ellen:** So I can make more friendships like Kaoru and Nene\.\.\. I'll try my hand at making a manga next\!  
**Ellen:** It's Hokkaido-\!  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.I've never traveled that cozy before in my life\. First class is insane\. I can't go back to the overnight bus after that\.\.\.  
**Nene:** Nee\.  
**Ellen:** I asked a friend and they set it up for us\!  
**Nene:** Nenene\!\?  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.I never can tell what's up with your connections\. So, what're we in Hokkaido for anyway\?  
**Ellen:** To make the world a better place-\!  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.Huh\?  
**Kaoru:** We're on vacation and there's still aradama-\!\?  
**Ellen:** Kaoru-\! One's going your way\!  
**Kaoru:** \"One's going your way\~\" Come on\! I only came with cause you said we were going on a trip to Hokkai\.\.\. do\!\!  
**Ellen:** And we are here in Hokkai\.\.\. do\!  
**Ellen:** Phew, that was the last of them now\. Nene\? Could you strike a pose there\.\.\. like, \"I beat the aradama\!\"  
**Nene:** Ne-\!  
**Ellen:** That's perfect-\! You're looking cool, Nene\!  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.Is that a sketchbook\? What're you doing now\?  
**Ellen:** Please give me some quiet here, Kaoru\! Nene, be sure not to move, okay\?  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.Well, I'm fine with whatever so long as I get a break\. Though\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** She still sucks at drawing, huh\. I can't even tell what that's supposed to be\.  

## [Ceremonial Dress Misogi - Ellen: End\]: I've Done It\!
**Ellen:** It's Okinawa-\!  
**Kaoru:** Nobody told me we were making a 2 days 1 night trip across Japan\.\.\.  
**Nene:** Ne-\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** Didn't I tell you we were on a trip to make the world a better place\?  
**Kaoru:** Just going to Hokkaido is enough of a trip\! And, what's the deal with drawing Nene doing weird poses everywhere\?  
**Nene:** Nenenene\!  
**Ellen:** Fu fu fu\. That I can't even tell you about yet, Kaoru\. You can look forward to it when we get back\.  
**Kaoru:** Is that how it is\. So, where're we going this time\? You looked up stuff for Okinawa too, didn't you\?  
**Ellen:** Unfortunately, there wasn't any news on aradama in Okinawa\. So, let's go to a Ryukyu karate dojo\!  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.What happened to making the world a better place\?  
**Kaoru:** Aghh\.\.\. Ahh\.\.\. This sucks; you didn't say anything about training on the beach\.\.\.  
**Nene:** Nee\.\.\. Neee\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** You're never going to get your black belt if that's enough to make you call it quits\! You both need more training, Kaoru, Nene\!  
**Kaoru:** I'm pretty sure I've never said I wanted a black belt\.  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.But you seem pretty good at this, Ellen\. Were you doing Ryukyu karate on top of Taisha-ryu or something\?  
**Ellen:** Yes\! It's just something I picked up in the past\.  
**Kaoru:** Where'd you pick that up\?  
**Ellen:** Huh, didn't I tell you\? A little bit before we met, I was here in Okinawa\.  
**Kaoru:** Ahh\.\.\. That sounds familiar, come to think of it\. You were helping with that what's-it-called development place, right\?  
**Ellen:** The Special Rare Metals Applications Research Institute\. I was a test operator for storm armor there\.  
**Kaoru:** So then, you must've been living around here, huh\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** Yes\! I know tons of great places to eat too\!  
**Kaoru:** Now that sounds good\. Take me somewhere you recommend\.   
**Ellen:** Sure thing\! There's so many places I want to take you to, I can't settle for just one\!  
**Ellen:** Hmm, hm hm hm hm hmm\~\. Hm hm hm hmhm, hmm\~\! \.\.\.It's done\!  
**Ellen:** It sure comes out differently after you've seen it firsthand\! Okay then\.\.\. Now to upload\!  
**Comment 1:** This week it's the tanuki's big adventure\?  
**Ellen:** \.\.\.So making a manga didn't work either\? I thought I drew it pretty well too\.\.\.  
**\?\?\?:** I don't know if it's a tanuki or what, but I really like how that little guy worked so hard to beat the aradama\.  
**Ellen:** Ah\.\.\.\.\.\.\!  
**Ellen:** I-I've done it----------\!  
**Ellen:** I-I've done it----------\!  
**Kaoru:** Seriously, if she's drawing a manga, she could've just said so\. Right\?  
**Nene:** Nene\!  
**Ellen:** Kaoru-\! Come over here for a minute-\!  
**Kaoru:** What do you want; it's late\. I was going to bed, y'know\?  
**Ellen:** This is a huge deal\!  
**Kaoru:** Can you believe her\.\.\.\?  
**Kaoru:** Nn\?  
**Comment:** The art's not great, but I like it a lot too\.  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.Dang\. Guess I didn't have to go and do that after all\.  
**Nene:** Ne-\!  

## [Police Officer - Ellen: Start\]: You Won't Get Away With Any Parking Violations\!
**Ellen:** Our first job for the aradama safety awareness campaign went smoothly, but what should we be doing next\?  
**Police PR Official:** From here, we'd like you to help with each of the other departments, so could you go see what the traffic department needs, Kohagura-san\?  
**Ellen:** I'm on it\!  
**Ellen:** I'm Kohagura Ellen, here to help\! I'll be in your care\!  
**Traffic Officer:** That's a nice upbeat attitude\! Then, if I could get right to it, I'll explain what we need your help with\.  
**Traffic Officer:** There's a lot of cars parking on the streets around here, so we're stepping up our regulation of parking violations\. Do you think you could come around as my assistant today\?  
**Ellen:** Sure thing\!  
**Traffic Officer:** Ah, looks like I've already spotted a parking violation there\. Let's go over\.  
**Ellen:** Okay\! I see, so that's a parking ticket\.  
**Traffic Officer:** If you get one of these, you'll have to pay a fine and points get deducted from your license\. There's no good that comes from it\.  
**Driver:** Ah-\! Hang on a minute\! I was only parked here for a second, so could you overlook it\?  
**Traffic Officer:** Sorry, but those are the rules\. There's signs that clearly state this is a no parking zone\.  
**Driver:** I was back in no time though; I just had to do a little shopping\. Was I bothering anybody\?  
**Traffic Officer:** This is a vital location in case an emergency vehicle needs to make a stop here\. Even if you weren't here for long, it still isn't allowed\.  
**Driver:** Tch\.\.\. You want to fill your quota that bad\? You're just tax thieves\! Who do you think's paying your salaries\.  
**Ellen:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Traffic Officer:** Okay, thanks for your cooperation\. Please drive safely now\.  
**Ellen:** They just left\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** I can't believe how rude they were\! They're the ones who broke the rules, so how can they act like that\.\.\.  
**Traffic Officer:** It's just the way it is\. We hear that stuff all the time, so I'm fine with it, but are you alright, Kohagura-san\?  
**Ellen:** I'm fine\. It was kind of a sucker punch, but\.\.\. I can tell just what you police officers have to go through\.  
**Ellen:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\?  
**Traffic Officer:** What's wrong\? Did you notice something\?  
**Ellen:** Just now, I thought I saw somebody watching us from behind that building\.\.\.  
**Traffic Officer:** Oh dear, do you think it's trouble\?  
**Ellen:** I must have imagined it\. Anyway, we have a job to do\!  
**Traffic Officer:** We managed to crack down on a lot of cars in such a short period of time\. You've been a real help, Kohagura-san, since you catch on so quick\.  
**Ellen:** Thanks a lot\. Though, I'm surprised how whenever we give someone a ticket, they're always so insulting to us\.  
**Traffic Officer:** From their perspective, we're more like sworn enemies coming out of nowhere to hit them with a fine\.  
they're suddenly getting hit with a fine, 

  
**Traffic Officer:** But, even if they hate us for it, we have to keep the town safe around here\.  
**Ellen:** It sure sounds like a tough job\.\.\. Hm\.\.\.\? I think someone's watching us after all\.\.\.  
**Traffic Officer:** I could tell just now too\. Like someone's watching from behind the trees on the side of the road\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** Someone stubbornly watching us from afar\. I wonder who would do that\.\.\.  

## [Police Officer - Ellen: End\]: The Source of the Suspicious Gaze\.\.\.
**Ellen:** Do you think it's maybe someone holding a grudge against us for giving them a ticket\.\.\.\?  
**Traffic Officer:** I can't deny the possibility\. But, even if someone holds a grudge against us, we're just doing our job\.  
**Ellen:** That's right\! I'll do what I can to help out too\. And, if it comes down to it, I'll keep you safe too\.  
**Traffic Officer:** I feel safer already\.  
**Traffic Officer:** \.\.\.\! They're watching us again\! From inside that car this time\.  
**Ellen:** In a car\? Which one\?  
**Traffic Officer:** There, the car that just stopped at the parking lot on the corner\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** Wait, that car\.\.\.\!\?  
**Traffic Officer:** We'd better not wait for them to try anything; let's question the driver\.  
**Ellen:** Wow\! Please hang on a minute\! I know that car\.\.\.\!  
**Traffic Officer:** Could I have a word with you, sir\?  
**Traffic Officer:** Can you tell us what you were doing parking your car here\?  
**Ellen:** Wow\! I knew it\! I'm sorry about all this, officer\!  
**Traffic Officer:** What's wrong, Kohagura-san\? What are you apologizing for\?  
**Ellen:** This is my\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** Grandpa\!  
**Traffic Officer:** Grandpa\.\.\. He's your grandfather\!\?  
**Friedman:** I am\. Nice to meet you\. I'm Ellen's grandfather, Richard Friedman\.  
**Ellen:** Grandpa, what are you doing here\!\?  
**Friedman:** I was having a look at you on your police duty\.  
**Ellen:** Were you also the one watching us from behind the building before too\?  
**Traffic Officer:** And from behind the trees by the side of the road\.\.\.\?  
**Friedman:** That was me\. I thought that I shouldn't go coming up to talk to you while you were working\.  
**Traffic Officer:** Is that all it was\.\.\. That's good to hear, right, Kohagura-san\?  
**Ellen:** It's a relief, but\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** Don't go doing something so misleading, Grandpa\!  
**Friedman:** Sorry, sorry\. Though, I have to say, Ellen, you look very good in that police uniform\.  
**Friedman:** And you were on top of your work too; it was like watching a real police officer go about their business\.  
**Ellen:** Grandpa\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** But still, secretly peeping on someone is against the rules\!  
**Ellen:** If you do that again, I'm giving you a ticket, Grandpa\!  
**Friedman:** Now that would be bad\. I'll get permission beforehand next time\.
