## 1: Clashing Thoughts and Feelings (1)
**Chie:** I won't forgive them... For what they did to everyone at Mokusa... I'll avenge them for sure...  
**Mirja:** I understand how you feel, but please set your personal feelings aside. Anger will only cloud your thoughts and narrow your vision.  
**Mirja:** If you can't maintain your composure, you won't be capable of your usual ability.  
**Chie:** I know that... But, it's easier said than done...  
**Mihono:** It's only natural. If Minoseki had been attacked and something awful happened to everyone, I know I'd feel the same way.  
**Mihono:** Nobody's going to be okay with the people they care about getting hurt.  
**Mirja:** I didn't say she had to be okay with it. I asked her to please keep her emotions under control.  
**Chie:** And if it were that simple...  
**Mirja:** If you can't do that, then you shouldn't go any further. Far from revenge, the most you'll accomplish is getting yourself killed.  
**Kiyoka:** Mirja-san... How is it you can always be... So level headed?  
**Mirja:** If I weren't, I would be unable to protect anyone. That goes for many people, of course, including all of you and myself.  
**Mihono:** Mirja-san's already such an adult. You're so smart and self-controlled. I wish I could be like that.  
**Mihono:** But that's impossible for me. Even when I know I shouldn't, I can't help but follow my heart...  
**Yui:** Hey, c'mon-\! Everyone just calm down\! There's no point in arguing with each other now\!  
**Yui:** Your cute faces'll get stuck like that if you keep frowning\! Cheer up\! Smile\! Let's get along\!  
**Mirja:** I am calm. I don't think we were arguing either. I was simply stating my mind.  
**Kofuki:** Anyway, whatever happens, happens. Panicking's not gonna get us anywhere. You'll just tire yourselves out here.  
**Mihono:** Aren't you panicking, Fukki? Things are getting crazy, and there's not a lot of time left.  
**Kofuki:** I told you, whatever happens, happens. Or what, is panicking gonna make us come out the other side happily ever after? Course not. So why not take it easy?  
**Mihono:** Take it easy... That doesn't sound like something you'd say... After all, you're always charging ahead.  
**Kiyoka:** You're right...  
**Kofuki:** Shuttup\! Just quit getting all worked up, alright\!  
**Yui:** But are we even going to make it? Kamakura's still super far away.  
**Chie:** We'll make it. No matter what happens, we'll make it.  
**Kiyoka:** P-Please don't let anything happen...  
**Kofuki:** Don't count on it. When it rains, it pours.  
**Aradama:** KIKIKIGGIGIGIGIGIG...  
**Yui:** Why can't life ever be easyyy\! When they say god is dead, this is what they mean\! But at least let there be a goddess out there\!  
**Mirja:** What should we do? If you don't want to waste a moment getting revenge, we could hurry on ahead and trust other toji will deal with this.  
**Yui:** Eh? But then won't ordinary people get attacked? I don't want to see any girls getting hurt\!  
**Chie:** ...You don't have to be so harsh. You know I wouldn't do something that awful.  
**Mirja:** I'm just relieved to see you haven't lost sight of your duty as a toji. Good then, let's quickly exterminate these aradama.  

## 2: Clashing Thoughts and Feelings (2)
**Mihono:** Even if we'd had more time to fight them, those were some pretty tough aradama, right?  
**Yui:** It's hard not to think they're trying to stop us from getting to Kamakura, you know?  
**Mirja:** Unexpectedly, that may in fact be the case. However, even so, that doesn't mean we'll do as they please.  
**Mirja:** By defeating all aradama we come across, we might at least throw off our enemy's plans.  
**Chie:** Agreed. We won't let them get away with this.  

## 3: As Toji (1)
**Kiyoka:** Why do they have to keep delaying us at a time like this...  
**Chie:** Even so, that doesn't mean we can ignore them. Regardless of how serious our mission is, there's nothing more important than protecting the people from aradama.  
**Chie:** As toji, we were chosen by okatana for that purpose. It's frustrating, but... That's the one thing we can't forget.  
**Mihono:** That's right... Good old Chii-nee; you said it\!  
**Mirja:** That said, we can't afford many more interruptions. All we can do is pray no more aradama appear.  
**Yui:** But like they say, if you see one, expect thirty, right?  
**Kofuki:** That's cockroaches\! But I guess it's not really wrong here either.  
**Kiyoka:** C-Cockroaches...? Ughhh\~\... Now I can't help but imagine them... My spine's tingling... So gross...  
**Yui:** Ahhn\~, sorry, Kiyoka-chan\! At times like this, you should just think of something fun\!  
**Kiyoka:** Something fun... Something fun... When this mission's over, I want to eat crepes in Harajuku... I guess...?  
**Yui:** Nice, nice\~ It's so girly\! And I'll go with you. Let's have a crepe party\!  
**Yui:** Still though, isn't what you just said a pretty serious flag?  
**Mihono:** What's a flag?ã€€Anyway, we need to keep going--  
**Aradama:** GUKIIKIKIGIGIGIIGI...  
**Mihono:** Uwah, more of them\!\!  
**Yui:** Ahaha, it was a flag alright\! Ah, Mihono-chan, that's what a flag means. Like when something gives you a bad feeling and then it happens?  

## 4: As Toji (2)
**Kiyoka:** Sigh\~\... I think there actually might have been thirty of them...  
**Kofuki:** We're seriously running short on time now... If these keeps up, we're not gonna make it, are we?  
**Mihono:** Don't worry, we'll definitely make it\!\!  
**Kofuki:** We will...? Do you know something I don't?  
**Mihono:** I do\!  
**Mirja:** I'm interested too. Please tell us.  
**Mihono:** If you give up, then it's all over. But so long as you keep trying, the chances are always greater than 0%\! That's why.  
**Kiyoka:** That's... Not exactly a reason, Hono-chan...  
**Mirja:** That's putting it lightly... Though, there is some logic to it.  
**Mirja:** If we resign ourselves to not making it, all our paths will close off. To prevent that from happening, we need to devote ourselves fully to all we can do right now.  
**Chie:** Yes, that's right.  

## 5: All We Can Do (1)
**Yui:** Nnnnnnghhhnnnhn\~\~\~\~\~\!  
**Kofuki:** Shut up, what're you moaning about? You're bringing the mood down, so keep quiet already.  
**Mihono:** Does your stomach hurt? Do you need to go to the bathroom? There's probably a convenience store nearby.  
**Yui:** Nah, that's not it... Can I ask a question real quick?  
**Mihono:** Sure, what?  
**Yui:** I'm cool with going to the Origami estate and all, but what are we going to do when we get there? I've been wondering that.  
**Yui:** Are we all supposed to fight the head of the family together?  
**Yui:** But I don't know how we can beat her, and if Mokusa has a plan, then what if we're just getting in their way?  
**Mihono:** Now that you mention it, I got so carried away I never thought about what we were going to do when we get there\!  
**Kiyoka:** Well... Aren't we going to support them?  
**Kofuki:** By doing what, exactly?  
**Kiyoka:** Like, um... Cheering them on...?  
**Mihono:** We can get them food\! You can't fight on an empty stomach, after all\!  
**Kofuki:** Great idea\! Nobody likes fighting when they're hungry\! Maybe we could find a place to pick up some stamina loaded bentos--  
**Kofuki:** --Or maybe we could find a place to get your head checked\!  
**Yui:** Nice comeback\!  
**Kofuki:** Damnit... I already learned not to expect anything from Mihocchi, but not you too, Kiyoka... Cheer them on, seriously?  
**Kofuki:** You've been spending too much time together. Maybe you caught her Mihocchitis?  
**Kiyoka:** That's rude. I'm not as bad as Hono-chan...  
**Mihono:** Hm...? Am I imagining things, or is what you just said way ruder? --Well, whatever\!  
**Chie:** ...You're just going to let that pass?  
**Mihono:** If that's how you're gonna be, Fukki, then let's see you come up with something everyone agrees with\!  
**Kofuki:** I'm just the muscle. Mirja's the brains here, right?  
**Mihono:** Ahh, you just weaseled out of it and pushed it on someone else\! Play fair, Fukki\!  
**Kofuki:** I wasn't weaseling\! And there's nothing unfair about it\!  
**Mihono:** Well, can you tell us what you're thinking, Mirja-san?  
**Mirja:** I don't mind sharing, of course, but first we should deal with the enemies in our way.  
**Aradama:** GUKIIKIKIKIGGIGIGI...  
**Kiyoka:** Th-They're here again...  

## 6: All We Can Do (2)
**Mihono:** So then, what should we be doing?  
**Mirja:** That would be as you've seen just now, with these aradama.  
**Mirja:** As we push further in to join with Mokusa, more of them will move to stop us. The forces they've gathered will now be split.  
**Chie:** Oh, a diversion strategy, right?  
**Mirja:** Yes. We'll try to get their attention as much as possible, and they'll concentrate their strength on us.  
**Mirja:** Those from Mokusa should face less needless conflict while infiltrating, and the chances of their success should rise significantly.  
**Kofuki:** So basically, we're the bait.  
**Mihono:** A diversion strategy... Okay\! If it helps Kanami, I'll cause them all kinds of trouble\!  
**Mihono:** See, there's something we can do after all\! Where there's a will, there's a way, guys\!  
**Everyone:** Yeah\!\!  

## 7: In the Nick of Time
**Mihono:** We're finally in Kamakura. Did we make it...? We're not too late, right?  
**Mirja:** The Origami estate is just ahead. All we can do is have faith and keep going.  
**Yui:** Ah... Hang on, everyone\! Isn't this Mokusa?  
**Chie:** What? What are you talking about?  
**Yui:** I checked my phone while we stopped just now, and-- Just look at this video, it's a live broadcast\!  
**Reporter:** The mysterious submarine that suddenly appeared in the Port of Yokosuka has declared they have an urgent announcement to make, but as of yet, have taken no action.  
**Reporter:** There is currently a state of confusion, while various theories are being speculated as to what their intent is and what this urgent announcement could be.  
**Reporter:** We will remain here commenting on the scene as the military--  
**Chie:** No doubt about it, that's Mokusa's sub. Thank goodness, it seems like we made it in time... I really wasn't sure if we would.  
**Kiyoka:** It's actually going to happen... I'm so nervous my hands won't stop shaking...  
**Kofuki:** That's not gonna make things any easier. Just loosen up.  
**Kiyoka:** You say that, but... Uuuu\~\...  
**Mihono:** When you're nervous, just write "people" on the palm of your hand, swallow it, and that's sure to calm you down\!  
**Kiyoka:** I already swallowed it... I lost count how many times... Maybe more than fifty by now...  
**Mihono:** Already tried it, huh-\! Well, I'm out of ideas.  
**Kiyoka:** That's your only tip\!\?  
**Kofuki:** Just don't worry about it.  
**Kiyoka:** Ehhhh\~\~\!\?  
**Yui:** It's okay\! I know just the thing\! It comes with a 100% guarantee to make you feel all better\!  
**Kiyoka:** Wh-What should I do?  
**Yui:** Human contact has been proven to help relax\! So\~ that's\~ why\~, when you're feeling nervous, a hug's all you need\! Come on, Kiyoka-chan\!  
**Kiyoka:** Ahaha... Maybe there's another way...  
**Chie:** Other than Kiyoka, you all seem pretty relaxed, actually.  
**Mihono:** I was feeling anxious before, but now's the time to get it together, right?  
**Mirja:** Then, let's go, to the Origami estate.  
**Mihono:** Yeah\!
