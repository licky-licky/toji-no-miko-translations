**Announcer:** Next on the news: tamayori toji\. There hasn't been a day we haven't been talking about this lately, has there\?  
**Man:** It lets the toji defeat aradama safely, doesn't it\? I don't see why they shouldn't use it more often\.  
**Woman:** There's only been more aradama after the Great Year-End Disaster, so it'd be a waste not to\.  
**Expert:** Still, tamayori toji are using aradama, aren't they\? Isn't that dangerous\?  
**Makoto:** That issue has already been resolved\. It has practically no effect on the toji themselves\.  
**Expert:** Maybe, but doesn't it feel wrong, having to wear that on their body\? Is there even a point to that\?  
**Makoto:** There is\.  
**Makoto:** By equipping noro onto themselves, a tamayori toji is able to render attacks from aradama on the same level as that noro ineffective\.  
**Makoto:** With this, it's possible to dramatically reduce the risk of injuries among toji\.  
**Expert:** I-Is that right\?  
**Makoto:** It is\.  
**Makoto:** And, of course, it provides not only defense, but also enhances their attacks\.  
**Makoto:** Okatana and noro\. A toji making use of both can prove exceptionally effective against aradama\.  
**Announcer:** That's amazing\.  
**Expert:** But, even so\.\.\.  
**Makoto:** The perception of noro as something dangerous is an outdated belief\.  
**Makoto:** We have already successfully fused aradama with toji\. I firmly believe tamayori toji will be the model of the future of toji, able to keep everyone safe\.  
**Announcer:** Well then, why don't we move to a demonstration of how incredible tamayori toji are in practice\.  
**Chie:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** Tamayori toji are yet again the focus on television today\.  
**Ellen:** Apparently grandpa offered to be on this debate they're showing\. But Makomako turned him down\.  
**Kaoru:** This whole thing reeks\. They say over and over it's safe, but weren't there people the experiments screwed up on\?  
**Mirja:** Yes, we saw it with our own eyes\.  
**Chie:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** Setouchi Chie\?  
**Chie:** Ah, I'm sorry, I wasn't listening\. What were we talking about\?  
**Ellen:** Are you doing alright, Chie\?  
**Chie:** \.\.\.I'm fine\.  
**Kaoru:** As if\. You're totally distracted\.  
**Kaoru:** For real\.\.\. I wonder what Akira's up to right about now\.

**Akira:** Yo\.  
**Hitakami Toji:** You've been hard at work, Inago-san\. Are you done with your missions for today\?  
**Akira:** I had a little free time\. So I came to check in\.  
**Akira:** \.\.\.Has anything changed\?  
**Hitakami Toji:** No, I haven't seen any changes\.  
**Akira:** It might take cutting through utsushi to stop tamayori, but I hate to leave you with this awful job\.  
**Hitakami Toji:** It doesn't bother me\. I have faith that Makoto-sama will be able to cure them\.  
**Akira:** Same here\.  
**Akira:** \.\.\.Whoa\.  
**Hitakami Toji:** Are you having vertigo\? Your face is looking pale\.\.\.  
**Akira:** You can tell\? I've been feeling kinda worn out lately\.  
**Hitakami Toji:** Please try not to push yourself too hard\. You and Toribane-san are irreplaceable to us in the Hitakami faction\.  
**Akira:** Thanks\.  
**Akira:** But, whether or not the world's gonna accept tamayori toji, right now's when it counts most\.  
**Akira:** I can't go complaining I'm tired or anything\. Gotta go out to as many places as I can and show as many toji as possible how strong tamayori toji can be\.  
**Akira:** This'll all lead back into the future of toji\.  
**Hitakami Toji:** Right\!  
**Akira:** (Though\.\.\. This tiredness is seriously no joke\. What if this's one the side effects of being a tamayori toji\.\.\.\?\)  
**Akira:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\!  
**Akira:** (Don't go getting cold feet, Inago Akira\! You know you haven't got the compatibility Mihono does\! No shit something'd happen\! This isn't anything you weren't prepared for\!\)  
**Akira:** (Just a little more\.\.\. Just hold out a little longer\! Makocchan's on TV, doing what she can\.\)  
**Akira:** (And cause of that, we've got offers lining up from people wanting to sponsor us\!\)  
**Akira:** (But that's all based on us being success cases\! So long as Yuuki and me show results, it should go fine\!\)  
**Tamayori Toji:** Ugh, urgh\.\.\.  
**Akira:** --\!  
**Hitakami Toji:** If I remove her utsushi, she'll calm down\. Please stand back, Inago-san\.  
**Akira:** \.\.\.Nah, I'll help out\.  
**Hitakami Toji:** But\.\.\.  
**Akira:** Just let me do this\.  
**Tamayori Toji:** Ina\.\.\. san\.\.\. I'm so\.\.\.rry\.\.\.  
**Akira:** You still conscious\?  
**Tamayori Toji:** Ye\.\.\.s\.\.\. Sorry for\.\.\.  
**Akira:** \.\.\.There's nothing you've got to apologize for\. We're gonna do whatever it takes to save you, so just rest for now\.  
**Tamayori Toji:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Akira:** \.\.\.Just sleep it off a little longer\. I know it won't be long\.  
**Hitakami Toji:** Thank you very much, Inago-san\.  
**Akira:** Look after them for me\.  
**Hitakami Toji:** Right\!  
**Makoto:** Akira-chan\.  
**Akira:** Huh\? What's up, Makocchan\.  
**Makoto:** It's about Yuuki-chan\.\.\.  
**Akira:** --\!\? Did something happen with Yuuki\!\?  
**Makoto:** She's caught a cold\.  
**Akira:** \.\.\.Huh\?  
**Yuuki:** [cough cough\]\.\.\. I was careless and let myself get sick\.\.\.  
**Yuuki:** I was thinking I had somehow been feeling tired lately\.\.\.  
**Makoto:** There's no need for you to worry over it, Yuuki-chan\. Please just have a nice long rest\.  
**Makoto:** Once you're better, I'll be depending on you again\.  
**Yuuki:** \.\.\.Okay\.  
**Akira:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Akira:** The hell, Yuuki\. If you're catching colds, you must've not been training enough\. You better be ready when you get better, alright\?  
**Yuuki:** \.\.\.Sure\!  
**Akira:** So, rest up now\. As far as your missions go\.\.\. I'll handle 'em\.  
**Akira:** I'm counting on you to help Yuuki bounce back, Makocchan\.  
**Makoto:** Of course; just leave her to me\.

## 7: Yomi and Akira
**Yomi:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Suzuka:** Yomi-san\? You look troubled; is something the matter\?  
**Yomi:** \.\.\.No, it's nothing\.  
**Suzuka:** Are you sure\?  
**Yomi:** Yes\.  
**Yomi:** It's a personal matter, so I'll resolve it myself\.  
**Hitakami Toji A:** There's an intruder\!  
**Yomi:** \.\.\.  
**Hitakami Toji B:** You're\.\.\. Satsuki Yomi\! Why are you trespassing here\!\!  
**Yomi:** \.\.\.I've only come to meet with a friend\.  
**Hitakami Toji B:** A friend\!\?  
**Yomi:** Please let me see Inago Akira\.  
**Akira:** I was wondering what was going on; it's you, huh\.  
**Yomi:** Akira\.  
**Akira:** It's been a while\. So, you came to see me\?  
**Yomi:** That's right\.  
**Akira:** \.\.\.Then, let's head out for a bit\. Right now\.\.\. I don't want to go making things too noisy here\.  
**Yomi:** \.\.\.Alright then\.  
**Akira:** We've walked pretty far\. So, what'd you want\?  
**Yomi:** The side effects of tamayori\.\.\. You've noticed them, haven't you\?  
**Akira:** \.\.\.  
**Yomi:** That's the underlying cause of Toribane-san's cold as well\.  
**Akira:** I'm the one who should be asking how you noticed\. What'd you do\?  
**Yomi:** I have eyes always watching around you\. I've noticed several times your and Toribane-san's eyes turning red\.  
**Akira:** Tch, well shit\.  
**Akira:** So you've seen this then\.  
**Yomi:** Please stop using aradama for combat\.  
**Akira:** You're one to talk\.  
**Yomi:** No one besides me\.\.\. should have to use this power\. Please suspend all research into tamayori toji\.  
**Akira:** I made up my mind to deal with this\. Besides, the effects aren't as bad as putting noro right in your body like myouga\.  
**Yomi:** But it is having an effect\. Are you still going to hold to those words\?  
**Akira:** Course I am\. Our leader's the one saying it's safe\.  
**Yomi:** Akira\.\.\.  
**Akira:** As buddies, I appreciate you worrying about me\. Thanks\.  
**Akira:** But, that's not happening\. This isn't enough to make me roll over and give you an \"Oh, is that right\?\"  
**Yomi:** \.\.\.Does Hitakami-san know about this\?  
**Akira:** \.\.\.Don't you dare tell Makocchan\. Don't think I won't hold a grudge just cause you're you\.  
**Yomi:** \.\.\.So she doesn't know\.  
**Yomi:** Was the reason you brought me out here also so this conversation wouldn't reach Hitakami-san's ears\?  
**Akira:** \.\.\.  
**Akira:** Since you came all the way to see me, and cause we go way back, I'll say this much\.  
**Akira:** Stay out of our business\. I'm not showing mercy to anyone who doesn't; not even you\.  
**Yomi:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Akira:** I'm glad we got a chance to talk again\. Seeya\.  
**Yomi:** \.\.\.\.\.\.Akira\. I\.\.\.
