**[New Year's Mirja:** Start] Mirja's First Shrine Visit of the Year  
**Mirja:** As one would expect, there are a great number of people out for New Year's Day. Let's all take caution so that no one gets lost.  
**Yui:** Okay\! You got it, Mirja-san\!  
**Mirja:** ...I don't see anyone besides you, Yamashiro Yui. What happened to the others?  
**Yui:** While you were talking, they all got swept away in the crowd\!  
**Mirja:** I see.  
**Mirja:** There's nothing we can do if we've already become separated. I'll notify everyone to make their first shrine visit on their own.  
**Yui:** So basically, that means I get to make my first shrine visit all alone with you?  
**Mirja:** That's how it is.  
**Yui:** Hyaa\~\! I'm so excited\~\!\!  
**Mirja:** Yamashiro Yui, I propose we take measures to avoid splitting up any further. Put out your hand.  
**Yui:** Y-You don't mean...\!\?  
**Mirja:** We'll hold hands.  
**Yui:** Ahh, give me a second, give me a second pleaseee\! I'll take my glove off right now\!  
**Yui:** Wh-What do I do about my hand sweating... Ahh, Mirja-san's hand, it's so rough... Wait, you're wearing a glove\!  
**Mirja:** Will you please wear a glove as well? Your hand will get frostbite.  
**Mirja:** After you put your glove back on, we'll get in line to visit the shrine.  
**Yui:** Wha-- You mean that line that looks like it'll for sure take an hour to get through\!\? You know that lovers always break up because of long waits in lines, don't you\!\?  
**Mirja:** We came here to make our first shrine visit, so of course I do. And also, where did you learn that statistic?  
**Yui:** From my own research\!  
**Yui:** And so, for the sake of our future together, we should go draw our fortunes first\!  
**Yui:** ...Mirja-san, isn't it kind of like we're on a date together?  Kyaa\! I said it\!  
**Mirja:** Is the short performance over now? If so, let's draw our fortune slips.	[The term Mirja uses, koshibai, literally small play, refers to plays that were too small to be performed in theaters and were traditionally held at shrines.]  
**Mirja:** Hm, mine reads "great fortune". That's how it is then.  
**Yui:** You got a great fortune, Mirja-san? Since I'm a fortune drawing pro, I'll do it too\!  
**Yui:** There-\! ...Wait, "great misfortune"\!\?  
**Yui:** Wh-Wh-Wh-What do we do about this, Mirja-san\!\?  
**Mirja:** Calm down, Yamashiro Yui. At this shrine, they have an offering box where you can deposit misfortune and great misfortune slips.  
**Mirja:** After doing that, your great misfortune is meant to turn into great strength.  
**Yui:** I'll go put my great misfortune in the box right away\!  
**Mirja:** If you run, you'll trip and fall.  
**Yui:** Don't worry\! A toji wouldn't trip-- WAGH-\!\?  
**Mirja:** Just as I was telling you... Yamashiro Yui, is your leg alright?  
**Yui:** Mirja-san is stroking my leg...\! Is this my great strength already taking effect\!\?  
**Mirja:** What are you even saying?  
**Mirja:** ...Achoo. It's getting slightly colder, isn't it. After you've deposited your great misfortune slip, let's go warm ourselves up some.  
**Yui:** Eh-\!\? You're going to warm me up... Where are you planning on taking me\!\?

## [New Year's Mirja: End]: Prayer
**Mirja:** Sweet sake truly does warm you up, doesn't it.  
**Yui:** It sure does-. Sweet sake sure does warm you up-.  
**Mirja:** ? What's the matter? You're making a strange face.  
**Yui:** This is where I want you to say something like, "You're so much more charming when you're smiling"\!  
**Yui:** You got my hopes so high-. You got my hopes so high-\! You got my hopes up that we were going to do something a lot more intense-\!  
**Mirja:** I apologize then, for not meeting your expectations.  
**Yui:** You don't have to apologize\~\! I already knew all along it wouldn't be anything like that\~\!  
**Mirja:** Alright then. Still, this sweet sake is delicious, isn't it?  
**Mirja:** Would you like another cup, Yamashiro Yui?  
**Yui:** Hey, that's no good, Mirja-san\! What are you planning on doing to me, making me drink this much\!  
**Mirja:** I'm not going to do anything, and this sweet sake is made from malted rice, without the lees of actual sake, so it won't do anything to you either.  
**Mirja:** Now then, why don't we get in line, now that it's grown shorter?  
**Yui:** Sure\! By the way, did you know this, Mirja-san? When you pray to god, it's supposed to be better if you state your name and home address, then make your wish.  
**Mirja:** Is that true? You're well informed, Yamashiro Yui.  
**Yui:** There's something I want to be granted no matter what. Whether I have to ask a god or anything for help, I'll try whatever I can.  
**Yui:** So that's why, I looked up a lot of things.  
**Mirja:** I see. I hope that wish of yours is granted then.  
**Yui:** Yeah\!  
**Yui:** By the way, Mirja-san, are you going to pray for something? I can't even picture you praying to god for anything.  
**Mirja:** I have wishes I want to be granted too. What exactly do you take me for?  
**Yui:** Eh, but you don't have any flaws or weaknesses, do you, Mirja-san? That's why, if I had to say... You're a beautiful robot girl?  
**Yui:** Ah, that sounds perfect actually\! Your eyes are shiny and all\!  
**Mirja:** Could you not treat someone like they're a robot?  
**Yui:** I'm just kidding\! More importantly, please tell me what you're going to wish for\!  
**Mirja:** For the investigation team to accomplish their duties.  
**Yui:** ...That's not really a wish, is it?  
**Mirja:** Ahh, you have a point. Thinking on it, rather than a wish, it might be more of a promise I plan to impose on myself.   
**Yui:** I like that about you too\!  
**Mirja:** I have high expectations that the investigation team will be able to become an even better team.  
**Yui:** She just kept going\!\?  
**Mirja:** I hope that this will be another good year.

## [New Year's Ellen: Start]: Hanetsuki Competition\!
**Kanami:** The crowd of people here for their first shrine visit sure is huge.  
**Ellen:** But it's also a part of the season here in Japan. It's fun waiting around in all the commotion.  
**Kaoru:** And here I thought I'd get to laze around at home through New Year's-.  
**Nene:** Nene-\!  
**Sayaka:** Mai... You don't have to hold my hand anymore. I won't get lost.  
**Mai:** Ah, that's right. Sorry, I've been holding on all this time.  
**Sayaka:** It's okay... Your hand was warm.  
**Kanami:** Hey, Hiyori-chan, what'd you pray for?  
**Hiyori:** To be in good health. What about you?  
**Kanami:** Well, to meet more strong toji this year\! That's what I wished for.  
**Hiyori:** That sounds like something you'd do, but I guess there's nothing wrong with it.  
**Ellen:** What should we do now? We could draw fortune slips, or get sweet sake; or a whole bunch of things\!  
**Mai:** Since I'm here at the shrine, I thought I would buy some protective charms for my family, then bring them back home.  
**Ellen:** That sounds nice too. Hmm, I can't make up my mind. Isn't there some kind of special event you do at New Year's?  
**Kaoru:** It's not really an event, but what if we do that?  
**Kanami:** Ah\! We could play hanetsuki\! 	[Hanetsuki is a game similar to badminton, traditionally played at New Year's]  
**Ellen:** Looks like fun\! Let's do it\!  
**Hiyori:** I'll pass. You can have fun on your--  
**Kaoru:** Don't you know, Eternal? Playing hanetsuki is considered an act of prayer for a girl's development.  
**Nene:** Ne\~?  
**Hiyori:** ...\!\!  
**Kaoru:** You sure you want to miss out? I guess it's only just a prayer, after all-.  
**Ellen:** So then, Kanamin and I will be playing?  
**Hiyori:** Wait, I'm playing too...\!  
**Kaoru:** ......Heh.  
**Kanami:** If Hiyori-chan feels like playing, then I'll be the referee.  
**Sayaka:** ...What will you do, Mai?  
**Mai:** Let's see... I'll go pick out protective charms while I still can. If I let too much time go by, I think it'll be too crowded.  
**Sayaka:** Then, I'll go too.  
**Mai:** Okay. Let's get going then. We're going to go buy some charms for a bit, okay?  
**Kanami:** Ah, alright\! We'll see you later, Mai-chan, Sayaka-chan.  
**Ellen:** Getting to compete with Hiyoyon like this is making me excited. I'm not about to lose, okay-?  
**Hiyori:** I don't plan on losing either.  
**Kaoru:** You can do it-. 'Cause I'll be cheering for you-.  
**Ellen:** Kaoru, please cheer for me too-\!  
**Kaoru:** Yeah, you can do it too, Ellen-.  
**Kanami:** Give it your best shot, you two\~\!  
**Ellen:** Hiyoyon, here I go-? Let's start\! There-\!

## [New Year's Ellen: End]: Fun Together\!
**Hiyori:** HA-\!  
**Ellen:** Not bad, Hiyoyon\! HO-\!  
**Kanami:** That's crazy\! They've been going for so long now. Other people who came to the shrine are starting to watch too.  
**Kaoru:** Yep, that's Hiyori alright. It's like she's becoming one with the hagoita. [Flat paddle used in hanetsuki]  
**Hiyori:** Kaoru... Could you... Shut up-\!  
**Ellen:** How about this? HA-\!\!  
**Hiyori:** ...Kh\!  
**Kanami:** That settles it; Ellen-chan's the winner.  
**Ellen:** I did it\! Hanetsuki's pretty fun\~, isn't it.  
**Kaoru:** As a rule, you're supposed to draw on the loser with black ink, but we haven't got any. Too bad...  
**Ellen:** That reminds me, did you know about this?  
**Ellen:** The hagoita is a tool you use for hanetsuki, but, a long time ago, it seems like it was customary to give them to girls on New Year's, as a charm to ward off misfortune.  
**Kanami:** Huh-, so hagoita used to be used like that.  
**Ellen:** So, Kanamin and Kaoru, are you going to be playing next?  
**Kaoru:** Nah, I'm good.  
**Kanami:** Ehh-. Kaoru-chan-, come on-.  
**Kaoru:** Visiting a crowded shrine like this takes way more out of you than I expected. That's why, I've got to preserve my stamina, just in case.  
**Kanami:** Ah, then to make up for it, we can have a match together some other time\! Then I can spar against you, Kaoru-chan\! Would that work?  
**Kaoru:** Oi, why do we have to make up for it... Fine, I'll think about it. But only think about it.  
**Mai:** We're back. Are you all taking a break?  
**Hiyori:** Yeah. Or, actually, we might be done now.  
**Sayaka:** You're done... playing hanetsuki?  
**Ellen:** If you two feel like playing, then we can keep going. What do you think, Saaya?  
**Sayaka:** I'm... fine with not playing.  
**Mai:** I agree, I think I'm fine not playing too.  
**Ellen:** In that case, next up, should we all go draw our fortune slips for the year?  
**Kanami:** Ellen-chan, let's go check out the food stands after that\!  
**Ellen:** I was just thinking the same thing, Kanamin\! You and I are on the same page.  
**Sayaka:** Me too... I'm looking forward to the food stands.  
**Kanami:** Ehehe. It's kind of nice, isn't it? Doing this kind of thing. I hope we can all have a lot more fun again this year-.  
**Ellen:** Alll-right, let's all have another fun year together\!

## [Valentines Suzuka: Start]: A Similar Pair?
**Mirja:** As of now, there is only one more confirmed target in the shopping mall. Do you see it on the spectrum finder?  
**Aradama:** ...Ggii.  
**Suzuka:** There it is.  
**Suzuka:** (Rather than giving chase now with the two of us, it would be more effective to form a pincer attack. If these aradama are truly after the chocolate, then it shouldn't run to the other floors, but instead to the food court.)  
**Suzuka:** (There is only one route it can take to there. Our strategy should be for Kitora Mirja to circle around, and--)  
**Mirja:** I'll circle around to the food court\! Konohana Suzuka, you drive the aradama forward. As a precaution, I'll contact Kohagura and Tsubakuro as I move.  
**Suzuka:** \!  
**Suzuka:** Good, I won't object to that.  
**Suzuka:** Destroying them is most important, however--  
**Aradama:** ...GGGIII-\!  
**Suzuka:** It won't make it so easy, will it.  
**Suzuka:** Though, even if you run, I'll guide your every move.  
**Aradama:** GSHAA---\!  
**Mirja:** Just as planned. It's coming directly here.  
**Mirja:** However, I won't so lenient as to let such a mindless charge through\!  
**Suzuka:** Well done.  
**Mirja:** Bringing it down was nothing. You had the more difficult role of guiding it here.  
**Suzuka:** It might have been on the run, but that aradama would have only gone to where the chocolate is located, so it was hardly a challenge.  
**Mirja:** I see. Though, shouldn't you have been able to bring that aradama down?  
**Suzuka:** There are many things left unconfirmed about these aradama, so I decided to rely on the more certain method of a pincer attack. If you hadn't proposed the idea, I would have.  
**Suzuka:** I realize we are operating in two man teams during this mission, but it's been simple to carry out with how clear each other's intentions are.  
**Mirja:** I felt the same. I can follow on your sensible instructions without hesitation. The elite guard must operate very smoothly.  
**Suzuka:** I never give detailed instructions to the elite guard.  
**Suzuka:** The primary role of the elite guard is to escort Yukari-sama, so when carrying out large scale operations, I and Maki-san will take command of our own units.  
**Mirja:** Now that you mention it, that is certainly true. Hm...  
**Mirja:** While we are on the topic of the elite guard, what sort of person is Shidou Maki? How do you see her?  
**Suzuka:** Eh? W-What do... you mean by that...?  
**Mirja:** I have somewhat of an interest in Shidou Maki myself.  
**Mirja:** I'm not sure if you are aware, but in the tournament the year before last, I was defeated by her.  
**Mirja:** As I see her, she is a straightforward toji with a single-minded strength. Every one of her strikes had great force behind it.  
**Mirja:** However, as someone who is close at her side, I was wondering if you had a different impression.  
**Suzuka:** Is that all you meant. Though, I don't think my impression differs much from yours? There's no hidden side to speak of when it comes to Maki-san.  
**Suzuka:** Well, if I had to name something, she can be quite dense at times.  
**Mirja:** Is that so? She doesn't at all give that impression when fighting.  
**Mirja:** Thank you for answering such a trivial question of mine.  
**Suzuka:** It was nothing. Now then, why don't we make our way back.

## [Valentines Suzuka: End]: The Reason Behind Her Enthusiasm
**Patissier:** Sure, that would be fine. I can teach you some relatively simple tricks to making delicious chocolate even at home.  
**Suzuka:** Thank you very much. It won't be an issue for you to teach them to me, will it?  
**Patissier:** Well, it shouldn't be a problem so long as you don't go spreading online that it was our shop that taught it to you.  
**Patissier:** We're very grateful to all you toji. You're spending your spare time helping us, aren't you?  
**Patissier:** It's probably because you're all so cute, but we're selling more chocolate this year than usual.  
**Suzuka:** Well now. In that case, I'll gladly learn what you have to teach me.  
**Patissier:** Then, we can do it after we close up for the day. But, you must be tired from your duties, so don't push yourself, okay?  
**Suzuka:** Of course; thank you for your concern.  
**Ellen:** We're back-\! I had a pretty exciting experience, fighting with Yumecchi out there.  
**Yume:** Really? I was just fighting like I normally do\~.  
**Ellen:** You were really leading the way with how we were fighting before. It seems like anyone would have a hard time keeping up with you.  
**Yume:** Ah, now that we're here, I wanna eat some cake\!  
**Ellen:** That's a good idea\! I'm a little hungry myself.  
**Yume:** What should I have today\~? Mont blanc? Or pudding a la mode... Mmm, I think I'll go with the strawberry rare cheesecake after all\~.  
**Suzuka:** Strawberry is one of your favorites, isn't it, Yume. You like Ichigo Daifuku Neko as well, don't you?  
**Yume:** Yeah, I guess it is\~.  
**Suzuka:** Once you've finished eating, can I count on you to help us with managing the shop?  
**Suzuka:** I'll go ahead and get changed first.  
**Yume:** Sure sure-. You don't have to worry about me-.  
**Suzuka:** Thank you very much for your order. We hope to see you again.  
**Yume:** Thank you very much\~...  
**Yume:** Suzuka-onee-san, is it me, or are you acting extra excited today?  
**Suzuka:** I don't think that's the case? This is how I always am.  
**Yume:** Ehh, but I feel like something's different for sure-. Ah, maybe you got a special kind of cake\!  
**Suzuka:** If I had gotten a cake like that, I would have shared it with you, Yume.  
**Yume:** Hmm, I guess you would've. Then maybe I imagined it? But still...  
**Suzuka:** (I should have expected no less from Yume... She's so perceptive when it comes to the strangest things. I think it would be fine to tell her about being taught the tricks to making chocolate though.)  
**Suzuka:** (But, until Valenties day, I cannot allow Maki-san to find out.)  
**Suzuka:** (I'm only erring on the side of caution. Sorry, Yume.)  
**Suzuka:** (I'm sure the store's products would be more delicious, but I'm a bit interested in seeing Maki-san's reaction when I tell the chocolates I gave her are homemade.)  
**Suzuka:** Though, it is Maki-san after all. I'm sure she's no stranger to homemade chocolate.  
**Yume:** What's that about Maki-onee-san?  
**Suzuka:** Nothing at all. It isn't much longer until closing time, so let's give one last effort.  
**Yume:** You really are acting kinda suspicious today, Suzuka-onee-san\~...
