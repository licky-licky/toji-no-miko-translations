## 1: Let's Throw a Party
After the escape room game was concluded\.\.\.

  
**Ellen:** Great work on the escape room game\!  
**Chie:** Thank you so much for all your help\. It was thanks to everyone's efforts that the escape room game was a huge success\!  
**Tsugumi:** I wasn't sure if things would go wrong during the beta test, but the final result went better than I expected\.  
**Kaoru:** The beta test went wrong as soon as you decided to do it like that\. Do it normally like a normal person\.  
**Mirja:** You say that, Mashiko Kaoru, but there were things that could only be learned by doing it in that format\.  
**Mirja:** It was worthwhile in its own way\. If we ever need to conduct it again, we will be counting on you\.  
**Kaoru:** Count me out\! Find someone else to be your test subjects\.  
**Chie:** Thank you for your help today as well, Yanase-san\.  
**Mai:** It was nothing\! I only helped on the day of, but after seeing how much the customers were enjoying themselves, I wish I had joined you sooner\.  
**Chie:** In that case, next time we come up with something, I'll be sure to contact you right away\.  
**Chie:** This time, we had short notice to come up with something to promote the area\.\.\. It was honestly a lot of work\.  
**Ellen:** That's it\! I just came up with something good\! Let's all throw a party\!  
**Kaoru:** A tea party, since we did Alice in Wonderland\?  
**Ellen:** Yes\! I want to make written invitations and everything\. And if everyone brings tea and sweets, I'm sure it'll be a lot of fun\!  
**Chie:** That's a great idea\.  
**Chie:** We can plan another celebration party, and invite the girls who were too busy to join us now\.  
**Ellen:** Maybe we could invite Yukari-sama too\?  
**Chie:** I think she might be a little too difficult to get a hold of\?  
**Ellen:** Maybe you're right\.\.\. That's too bad\. I just found a place that makes the tastiest cakes too\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** Huhh, a cake place you didn't already know about\? Those still exist around here\?  
**Ellen:** No, I found it at a hotel I was staying in during an expedition\.  
**Ellen:** It was so good I couldn't believe it, so I went and got the chef's phone number\!  
**Mai:** Hotel cakes\.\.\.  
**Mai:** I was thinking I could bake some cookies, but\.\.\. I suppose it would be better if we let your favorite chef handle things\?  
**Ellen:** What are you saying\!\? Everyone would love to eat your cookies, Maimai\!  
**Ellen:** In fact, I don't think it'll work if we can't get your cookies at the party\!  
**Chie:** In that case, Ellen-san will take care of the cakes, and Yanase-san will take care of the cookies\.  
**Chie:** We should all make some quick decisions on what we're bringing, so none of us bring the same thing\.  
The day of the tea party\.

  
**Mai:** Ellen-chan's incredible\.\.\. I didn't expect her to rent out such a luxurious party hall\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** It's not that big a deal, Maimai\. I managed to fit it in our budget\.  
**Sayaka:** Kaoru, is that okay for the cups\?  
**Kaoru:** Yeah\. Lay them out nicely and that should be good\.  
**Kaoru:** Anyway, can we get this started already-\? I'm starving here-\.  
**Mai:** I think it would be best if we waited to cut into Ellen's cake after everyone arrives\.\.\. But, if my cookies are enough to get you by\.  
**Kaoru:** That's plenty\. They're as good as ever\.  
**Sayaka:** I like Mai's cookies\.  
**Ellen:** My cake is plenty good too\!  
**Kaoru:** It's not a competition\. If it's a cake that you picked out, of course it'll be good\.  
**Sayaka:** Mai\.\.\. Is it okay for me to be here\? \.\.\.I didn't help with the escape room game\.  
**Mai:** Don't worry about that, Sayaka-chan\. We gave you an invitation, didn't we\?  
**Sayaka:** \.\.\.Mm\!  
**Kaoru:** Oi oi, do we really have to work a time like this\.\.\.\?  
**Aradama:** GGGIIII\.\.\.  
**Mai:** Why would there be aradama here\!\? Wait\.\.\. It's running away\!  
**Kaoru:** Hey\.\.\. Did it look like that aradama was holding something to you\?  
**Sayaka:** \.\.\.Ah\. The cups we just set out\.\.\. They disappeared\.  
**Ellen:** I don't believe it\.\.\. The teapot is gone too\! The aradama must have run off with it\.\.\.  
**Sayaka:** I worked hard to set them out\.\.\.  
**Mai:** We can get it back if we hurry, Sayaka-chan\. We still have time before the tea party begins\!  
**Sayaka:** \.\.\.Okay\!  

## 2: The March Hare's Tea Party
**Ellen:** Good, now the teapot and cups are all set out again\!  
**Sayaka:** \.\.\.It's perfect\. They're lined up pretty\.  
[stomach growls]

  
**Sayaka:** \.\.\.Mai\?  
**Mai:** Th-That wasn't me, Sayaka-chan\!\?  
**Kaoru:** That was me\.  
**Kaoru:** After the aradama and the workout, I'm so peckish I'm about to grow a beak\.\.\.  
**Sayaka:** Grow a beak\? What do you mean\?  
**Kaoru:** What, you don't know\? It's what you say when you're feeling extra hungry\.  
**Sayaka:** \.\.\.I understand\. I'm growing a beak too\.  
**Mai:** Kaoru-chan, don't lie like that to Sayaka-chan\!  
**Ellen:** Though, I am feeling hungry too\. We can start for now with a March Hare's tea party\!  
**Mai:** There are just the right amount of people, with the four of us\.  
**Kaoru:** Then, since Ellen came up with the idea, she can be the March Hare\. I'll be the sleepy Dormouse\.  
**Mai:** I can be the Mad Hatter then, and Sayaka-chan, why don't you be Alice\?  
**Sayaka:** I can be Alice\?  
**Mirja:** Itomi Sayaka is going to be Alice\? I wasn't aware of that\.  
**Ellen:** Come right on in, Mirja, Tsugumin\!  
**Mirja:** Are we late\?  
**Mirja:** I thought there was still some time left before the party, however\.\.\.  
**Tsugumi:** Hmm, from the looks of it, we walked in just as you finished preparing, and were about to start a little early\?  
**Ellen:** That's a bingo\!  
**Mirja:** That's good then\. I was looking forward to sampling Kohagura Ellen's cake\. I we were late, I don't know what I'd do\.  
**Sayaka:** Tsugumi, will you sit here\?  
**Tsugumi:** If you're offering, how can I say no\? Let's see\.\.\. Should I just leave the sandwiches I brought on the table\?  
**Ellen:** Please do, Tsugumin\.  
**Sayaka:** \.\.\.You made them, Tsugumi\? Kofuki told me, whatever you make is bad news\.  
**Tsugumi:** No need to worry\. I understand how unpopular my cooking is, so I bought these pre-made and only added one sandwich of my own\.  
**Kaoru:** That's just Russian roulette\!  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.Whoa whoa, I can't even tell these sandwiches apart\.  
**Tsugumi:** The pre-made sandwiches only have a special sauce applied to them, so there's no visible difference\.  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.I'm not eating any of the sandwiches\.  
**Mihono:** Huh\? Everyone's already here\! Chii-nee\! Hurry, hurry\!  
**Chie:** You don't have to push me, Mihono-chan\! We still have plenty of time\!  
**Kofuki:** What, you were already here\?  
**Tsugumi:** Yes\. There were some preparations I had to make\.  
**Kofuki:** Preparations\? Hey, these sandwiches look pretty good\! I'm taking one\!  
**Sayaka:** Ah, those are\.\.\.  
**Kofuki:** BFWOAGH\!\?  
**Kiyoka:** Hello\.\.\. Wait, why is Kofuki-san on the floor\!\?  
**Suzuka:** Well now, what's all the commotion about\? Did something happen\?  
**Yume:** We brought omusubi-\!  
**Ellen:** Come find a seat, Hanahana, Yumecchi\!  
**Suzuka:** Thank you for the invitation\. And for your efforts with the escape room game\. I was relieved to hear it was a success\.  
**Yume:** I heard that a whole ton of people went\.  
**Ellen:** It's all thanks to the help you gave us, Yumecchi\.  
**Ellen:** Anyway\.\.\. It's right about time\. Let's start the tea party\!  
**Ellen:** Pick up the closest drink to you, and\.\.\. Here we go\!  
**Ellen:** Cheeeers\!  
**Everyone:** Good work on the escape room game-\! Cheeeers\!
