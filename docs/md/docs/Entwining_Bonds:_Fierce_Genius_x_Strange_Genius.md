## 1: An Awkward Trip for Two\?
**Yume:** There's a hot spring at the inn we're staying at tonight, right\? I can't wait\~\! When it gets to be night, let's play cards\! And also, I brought othello too\.  
**Yomi:** Tsubakuro-san, we aren't going here to enjoy ourselves\. Why not focus on completing our mission here first\?  
**Maki:** Yomi's right\. Today we're on a joint assignment with other toji\. As the elite guard, we need to always keep in mind that we set an example for the others\.\.\.  
**Suzuka:** Though, with this many of us here, we should be able to settle this quickly\.  
**Yume:** Yeah, and since I'm here, it'll be over right away\. And besides, the other girls look like they're having fun too\.  
**Mai:** Sayaka-chan, that bento was delicious, wasn't it\? Would you like to have something sweet for dessert too\? I baked cookies, just for today\.  
**Sayaka:** Wow, there's so many\.  
**Mai:** Since I heard there would be lots of us on this overnight trip, I rolled up my sleeves making them, but maybe it was too much\.  
**Sayaka:** No, I'm glad there's so many\.  
**Mai:** Ufufu, thank you\. Would everyone from the elite guard like some too\?  
**Yume:** Can I\? Thanks\. If she's offering, we should just have snacktime with them\! I'll work extra hard after we get there, so we can do it, can't we\?  
**Maki:** I don't see why not; we should be building up our stamina right now\.\.\.  
**Maki:** This is Shidou Maki\. Did something come up\?  
**Maki:** What\!\? Understood\. We'll deal with it at once\.  
**Suzuka:** Maki-san\? What's the matter\?  
**Maki:** It sounds like there's been a large outbreak of aradama in the mountain forests here\. Every moment counts, so we should get off the train here and deal with that first\.  
**Yomi:** But, if everyone gets off here, won't we be too late to complete our primary duty with this expedition\?  
**Maki:** Right, and HQ has a proposal for that\. From here, we'll organize into two groups and carry out our missions separately\.  
**Maki:** Yume, along with Itomi Sayaka, the two of you will stay on this train to our original objective and start on the mission\.  
**Maki:** The rest of us will get off the train now and hurry to the scene\.  
**Suzuka:** Yume and Itomi-san\? Those two are being sent alone to the mission point\?  
**Mai:** Shidou-san, would it be alright for me to to be with Sayaka-chan\? Sending the two of them alone is just a little\.\.\.  
**Maki:** I'm little unsure about it myself, but HQ named them directly, so they must have something in mind\. Yume, Itomi Sayaka, what do you think\?  
**Yume:** Cause I'm so strong, it'll be easy peasy even if I do it by myself\~\. You can go with them, Sayaka-chan\.  
**Sayaka:** I can be fine if I do it by myself too\. I'll defeat the aradama quickly, then meet up with you\.  
**Yume:** Nngh\~, well I can beat them in a second, and then I'll meet up with you onee-sans faster than Sayaka-chan can\!  
**Suzuka:** Sigh\.\.\. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem they have any intention of working together to defeat them\.  
**Maki:** It's not helping my concerns, but, with each of their skills, they should be able to manage\.  
**Yomi:** We appear to have reached our stop\. Everyone, let's go\. Tsubakuro-san, I wish you luck\.  
**Mai:** Sayaka-chan, will you really be alright without me\?  
**Sayaka:** Mm\. I can do my best if I have your cookies\.  
**Mai:** Sayaka-chan\! In that case, take them all with you\! Here\! And here\! And this batch too\!  
**Sayaka:** \.\.\.It's heavy\. But, thank you for all of them\. I'll work hard\.  
**Mai:** Of course\! Do your best, Sayaka-chan\.  
**Suzuka:** You too, Yume\. Try to get along with Itomi-san\.  
**Yume:** They're gone now\.  
**Sayaka:** Mm\.\.\.  
**Yume/Sayaka:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Yume:** WAHH-\! If we just stay quiet this whole time, I'll get so bored I'll die\!  
**Yume:** I know\! I came up with something good\. Sayaka-chan, since it's just us two, wanna have a competition\?  
**Yume:** A competition\?  
**Yume:** Yeah\. A competition to see who can beat the most aradama\! I'm pretty sure I'll win, but it'll still be fun, won't it\?  
**Sayaka:** \.\.\.Okay, but, I probably won't lose\.  

## 2: Yume and Sayaka's Showdown Begins\!
**Aradama:** GUOOOOO\.\.\.  
**Yume:** Kyahaha, a whole bunch came out\! Anyway, Sayaka-chan, our competition's starting\! EIIIII--\!  
**Sayaka:** I won't\.\.\. lose either\.\.\.  
**Yume:** Not bad, Sayaka-chan\! I think I should start getting serious soon too\! YAAAAAHH\!  
**Aradama:** Keeeee\.\.\.  
**Yume:** Huh\? Is it over already\?  
**Sayaka:** It looks like it\.\.\.  
**Yume:** Ahaha, they were so weak-\! Hey, hey, how many did you beat, Sayaka-chan\?  
**Sayaka:** I think I got about fifty\.\.\.  
**Yume:** No way-\! That's how many I got\! Boo\~, so it's a draw then, huhh\. But, for sure next time, I'm not gonna lose\!  
**Sayaka:** Mm\.\.\. I won't lose either\.  
**Yume:** Hello, Maki-onee-san\? It was easy as pie over here, you know\? \.\.\.Yeah, I got it\. We'll go ahead\.  
**Sayaka:** Shidou Maki\? What did she want\?  
**Yume:** It's about our rooms at the ryokan\. The elite guard got a Japanese style room, and everyone else got a Western style room, so she said to go ahead and wait there for them\.  
**Sayaka:** Are Mai and the others not here yet\? This room is\.\.\. too big by myself\.\.\.  
**Yume:** Are those onee-sans still not hereee\? I got the cards and othello board all set up, but this is boring-\.  
**Sayaka:** Mai, she's still not here\. But, we promised\.\.\. We'd go in the hot springs together\.\.\.  
**Sayaka:** Mai's calling\. Hello\?  
**Mai:** Sayaka-chan, I'm sorry\. We safely finished eliminating the aradama, but we didn't make it in time for the last bus, so we won't be able to make it back there tonight\.  
**Sayaka:** Eh\.\.\.\?  
**Mai:** I'm sorry about this\. I know you'll be lonely by yourself, but just rest up in preparation for tomorrow, okay\?  
**Sayaka:** I understand\. Okay\.\.\. Then, bye\.  
**Sayaka:** I'm alone until morning\.\.\.  
**Yume:** Hello, Maki-onee-san\? Huh\? Stop calling over and over\? But, it's so boring being by myself\.  
**Maki:** If you're bored, then why not play with Itomi Sayaka\? Don't you think she's bored by herself too\?  
**Yume:** I can't do that, because we promised we'd settle things tomorrow morning\. If we start getting along, then it won't be a competition\!  
**Yume:** Hey, if you're busy, Maki-onee-san, then what about Yomi-onee-san or Suzuka-onee-san\? I don't care which one, so let me talk to them, okay-\?  
**Yomi:** She handed the phone to me\. Tsubakuro-san, I remembered hearing a very interesting rumor about the inn we booked\.\.\.  
**Yume:** Eh-, like what, like what\? Is it a funny story\? I wanna know\~\! Tell me\!  
**Yomi:** As the rumor goes, a ghost is said to appear in the inn you're staying at\. Have you seen it yet\?  
**Yume:** EHH---\!\? What do you mean\? Nobody said anything like that to me\! Where is it\? Where's it supposed to come out\!\?  
**Yomi:** Ah, I'm sorry, I'm being called for something, so you'll have to excuse me\. Anyway, have a nice night, Tsubakuro-san\.\.\.  
**Yume:** EHHHHH-\!\? Hang on, Yomi-onee-san\! \.\.\.\.\.\.She hung up\.  
**Yume:** W-Well, stuff like ghosts isn't scary or anything\! Cause, I'm super strong and all\. There's nothing I can't beat\.\.\. \.\.\.Ah-- But, can you beat a ghost with an okatana\?		[Minor trivia, Yume's okatana, Nikkari Ao'e, actually got its name for a legend in which it killed a ghost]  
**Yume:** I didn't notice it, but it's completely dark outside\. \.\.\.I can't take this anymore\! I don't wanna stay here all alone by myself until morning--\!  
**Yume:** Oh, I got it\! Sayaka-chan might be scared all by herself\. Since I'm so strong, I'll go and help Sayaka-chan out\.  
**Yume:** I'll bring my snacks, and my cards, and othello with me\.\.\. Okay, here I go\!  
**Yume:** Wait, th-there it is---\! The ghost----\!  
**Sayaka:** Tsubakuro Yume\? What's wrong\? Was there a ghost\?  
**Yume:** Ah-- Sayaka-chan\. Th-That's not it\! There's no way a ghost was here\! Geez-, don't scare me like that, okay\? And, what's with you\? What do you have all those snacks for\.  
**Sayaka:** Can I sleep in this room\?  
**Yume:** Huh\?  
**Sayaka:** It's lonely, being in a big room by yourself\.\.\. And, I thought\.\.\. Maybe Tsubakuro Yume was feeling the same way\.\.\. Do you want to eat Mai's cookies together\?  
**Yume:** W-Well I wasn't scared of ghosts or feeling lonely or anything, but if that's what you wanna do, then that's okay-\!  
**Yume:** (Thank goodness\. If Sayaka-chan is here with me, I should be fine\.\)  

## 3: The Result of Their Competition Is\.\.\.
**Yume:** These cookies are actually really tasty\! I feel like I could eat them forever\.  
**Sayaka:** That's good\. I think Mai will be happy to hear it too\.  
**Yume:** Hey, hey, Sayaka-chan, after we're done eating, let's play othello\! We kept getting ties in cards, but I won't lose for sure at othello\!  
**Sayaka:** Mm\. I'll try it\.\.\.  
**Sayaka:** Ah, you took a corner again\.\.\. You're tough, Tsubakuro Yume\.  
**Yume:** This much is nothing-\. Maki-onee-san and them are always training me super hard\.  
**Sayaka:** So you do things like that too\.\.\. I'm a little surprised\.  
**Yume:** Even though they're always treating me like a little kid, they never go easy on me when we're playing games-\. Really, they can be so immature it's annoying\.  
**Yume:** What about you, Sayaka-chan\? Don't the onee-sans always treat you like a little kid\?  
**Sayaka:** Ummm\.\.\. I\.\.\. It doesn't bother me at all, but the others, they say that Mai's\.\.\. She's too overprotective of me\.\.\.  
**Yume:** Hmm\. It sorta seems like we both have it hard, being the youngest, don't we\.  
**Sayaka:** Mm\.\.\. Ah, if I put this here\.\.\.  
**Yume:** No way\! You flipped that many\!\? You turned the game around in one go\. Now I don't have anywhere to put any\!  
**Sayaka:** I win\.\.\.  
**Yume:** Mmgh\.\.\. That's only cause I got a little distracted talking to you now\! We're playing again\! I'm not stopping until I win\!  
**Sayaka:** That's fine, but\.\.\. I'm a little tired\.\.\. I'll take a short rest\.\.\.  
**Sayaka:** [snooze]\.\.\.  
**Yume:** Ehh-, hey, Sayaka-chan\! Wait\.\.\. She's really asleep now\.  
**Yume:** Well, if you're gonna be like that, then I guess I'll have to let you borrow my futon\!  
**Yume:** Yawn\~, looking at Sayaka-chan while she's sleeping is making me feel sleepy too\.\.\. Nn\.\.\.  
**Sayaka:** Tsubakuro Yume, wake up\. Your phone is ringing\.  
**Yume:** It's Maki-onee-san\. What's she want\? Hello-\?  
**Maki:** Yume, take Itomi with you and head to the site of the mission\. From the sound of things, the count of aradama there now dwarfs the amount yesterday\.  
**Maki:** We're headed there too right now, but it's going to be a while before we arrive\. Could you two find a way to hold out there on your own\?  
**Yume:** Yeah, me and Sayaka-chan'll be fine\. We'll finish it up before you onee-sans even get there\. Right-, Sayaka-chan\?  
**Sayaka:** Right\.\.\. Let's go\.  
**Aradama:** GUOOOOOOOOO\!  
**Yume:** Uwah-, it's true\! There's way more of them today-\!  
**Sayaka:** This looks\.\.\. a little difficult today\.  
**Yume:** This'll be a piece of cake\. Sayaka-chan, let's have another competition to see who can beat the most again today\!  
**Sayaka:** \.\.\.\.\.\.Hey, Tsubakuro Yume\.\.\. Instead of a competition today, what if we work together\?  
**Yume:** Work together\? But, we can't tell which one of us wins if we do that\.  
**Sayaka:** We still haven't done\.\.\. the punishment game for othello last night\. So\.\.\. can I make your punishment that we have to fight together\?  
**Yume:** Nngh\.\.\. If you say so, then\.\.\. Fine, but just for today\!  
**Sayaka:** Okay\. Then\.\.\. Let's go\.  
**Yume:** I'm next\! HAAAH\!\!  
**Sayaka:** Pant\.\.\. Pant\.\.\. I can finally\.\.\. see the end of them\. Let's finish\.\.\. the last of them together\.  
**Yume/Sayaka:** YAAA-----------\!  
**Yume:** We did it-\! I thought it would be a little bit harder, but now that it's over, we beat them pretty easy, huh\.  
**Sayaka:** Mm\. It's because you were helping me, Tsubakuro Yume\.  
**Yume:** \.\.\.Then, let's do a high five\! Yaay-\!  
**Maki:** What's going on here\?  
**Mai:** Sayaka-chan and Tsubakuro-san, high fiving\.\.\.  
**Yume:** Ah-- You're late, onee-sans-\! We already took care of it with just the two of us\.  
**Suzuka:** Eh\!\? The two of you took care of all those aradama\?  
**Yume:** When we put our skills together, it was as easy as that\! See, Sayaka-chan, she's really strong\!  
**Sayaka:** No, you did a lot of the work, Tsubakuro Yume\. You really are\.\.\. very strong\.  
**Yomi:** They seem to have gotten much closer while we were away\.  
**Maki:** That's for sure\. Yesterday, she was all fired up about, \"We're having a competition\!\" Did you settle that already\?  
**Yume:** Ah-\! That's right, we were competing, weren't we\.  
**Suzuka:** Sigh, Maki-san\.\.\. Just when they were getting along, you had to go and bring that up\.\.\.  
**Yume:** Sayaka-chan, we still haven't settled our aradama competition, and I'm not gonna let you back down from othello just cause you won once\!  
**Sayaka:** Mm, I'll take your challenge as many times as you want\.  
**Mai:** Fufu, it seems like their rivalry won't be stopping anytime soon\.
