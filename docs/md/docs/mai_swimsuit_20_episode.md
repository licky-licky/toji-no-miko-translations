## [Swimsuit 20 - Mai: Start\]: Am I Being\.\.\. A Bit Overly Helpful\?
**Mai:** Sayaka-chan\. Are you getting things ready for tomorrow\? If you'd like, I can help you\?  
**Sayaka:** I got ready yesterday\. I put what I needed in my bag, just in case\.  
**Mai:** Sayaka-chan, that's great\!  
**Sayaka:** I also made sure to put in my swimsuit and a change of clothes\. Should I bring a swim ring too\?  
**Mai:** If you want one to go down the river, it sounds like the campsite will rent them to you, so I think you'll be fine without\.  
**Mai:** It'll be easier for you if you have less to bring along\.  
**Mai:** (I can't help myself from wanting to look after Sayaka-chan, but since she's a serious girl, she can at least get the preparations done on her own\.\)  
**Sayaka:** Then, I won't bring it\. I'm really looking forward to tubing down the river tomorrow\. I want to do it with you\.  
**Mai:** Mm, let's do it together\. I'm sure it'll be fun and feel great\.  
**Sayaka:** And also, I'm looking forward to eating your cooking at the camp\. I might not eat breakfast before we leave\.  
**Mai:** You should at least eat breakfast before we go\. Though, I'm glad to hear you're excited for my cooking\.  
**Sayaka:** Okay, I will\. What will you make\?  
**Mai:** Since Chie-san is going along with us, I talked with her, and we'll basically be doing a barbecue\.  
**Mai:** We can't do anything too elaborate with it, after all\.  
**Mai:** I think you'll have fun and it would be even tastier if you try barbecuing some meat and vegetables yourself, Sayaka-chan\.  
**Sayaka:** I don't know how to cook\.\.\. But, I'll try it\.  
**Mai:** You'll be fine\. I'll be there with you, and I know you can do it\.  
**Mai:** And then, we also talked about using a big iron plate and making enough yakisoba for everyone\.  
**Mai:** So long as we bring noodles, we can make it with the ingredients from the barbecue\.  
**Sayaka:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Sayaka:** \.\.\.From talking about food, I started feeling a little hungry\.  
**Mai:** I know what you mean\. Talking like this makes you feel hungry, doesn't it\?  
**Mai:** But, it's probably best if you don't eat this late\.  
**Sayaka:** Mm\.\.\. I'll hold off\. I have to brush my teeth soon\.  
**Mai:** In that case, I'll be going back to my room\.  
**Sayaka:** I'll see you tomorrow\. Goodnight, Mai\.  
**Mai:** Mmhm, goodnight\.  
**Sayaka:** Ah\.\.\. Wait\.  
**Mai:** Hm\? What is it\?  
**Sayaka:** Tomorrow\.\.\. If you can, I want you to call me when you wake up\.\.\. I'm not sure I can wake up on my own\.  
**Sayaka:** \.\.\.Is that okay\?  
**Mai:** That's fine\. I'll give you a call\. And, if that doesn't wake you up, I'll come get you up myself\.  
**Sayaka:** Please do that\. Thanks\.  

## [Swimsuit 20 - Mai: End\]: Swim Ring Tubing\!
**Mihono:** That was good-\. Why is it that meat tastes so much better eating under a big blue sky\?  
**Mihono:** Ah, and of course, the yakisoba you and Mai made was really yummy too, Chii-nee\!  
**Chie:** I'm glad you liked it\. Ah, Mihono-chan\. If you want to go play, you have to wait a little after you eat, alright\?  
**Mihono:** I know that much-\!  
**Mai:** What did you think, Sayaka-chan\? How was the meat you cooked yourself\?  
**Sayaka:** It was tasty\. But, I wasn't sure how much to grill it at first, so I burnt some\.  
**Mai:** I know what you mean\. There were times I burned things when I first started cooking\. I was worried I might undercook it\.  
**Sayaka:** You did it too, Mai\? I want to try doing this again\. With Kaoru next time\.  
**Mai:** It would be nice to come again when Kaoru is free\.  
**Mai:** Now that we've eaten, why don't we take a short break and then go to the river\?  
**Mai:** It seems like there's places where the river hardly flows at all, and you can just leisurely float along\.  
**Sayaka:** That sounds like Kaoru would like it\.  
**Mai:** That's true\. If Kaoru-chan were here, I could see her relaxing with Nene-chan\.  
**Sayaka:** Tubing on the river\. I was looking forward to it so much, after we finished talking last night, I couldn't fall asleep right away\. I want to hurry and do it\.  
**Mai:** Kyaaaa\!  
**Sayaka:** Just then\! The water was moving a little faster\.\.\.\!  
**Mai:** Y-Yeah\. There's a pretty big difference in speed at some points of the river, isn't there\.  
**Sayaka:** Sometimes it slows down, and sometimes it speeds up a little\!  
**Mai:** Mmhm\.\.\. It's like a ride at an amusement park\.\.\.\!  
**Sayaka:** It's really\.\.\. fun\!  
**Mai:** When the water splashes you, it feels nice and cool\.  
**Sayaka:** Wahh-\!\?  
**Mai:** Are you alright, Sayaka-chan\!\?  
**Sayaka:** I'm fine\. The swim ring just started sinking a little\.  
**Mai:** Ah\.\.\. You scared me\.  
**Mai:** Oh, the tubing attendant is there\. It looks like that's the end\.  
**Sayaka:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Mai:** Hey, Sayaka-chan\? Do you want to go one more time\? Tubing back down the river\.  
**Sayaka:** I was just thinking I wanted to go again\.  
**Sayaka:** Mai\.\.\. You're amazing\.  
**Mai:** Fufu\. But Sayaka-chan, that's because your face is saying you wanted to do it even more\.  
**Mai:** Besides, I had a lot of fun doing it too\.
