## [Misogi - Yui: Start\]: A Different Possibility
**Tsugumi:** Good work, Yamashiro-san\. That's all I need from you for today\.  
**Yui:** Wait, are you sure\?  
**Tsugumi:** Yes\. I need to set some aside for Shichinosato-san, after all\.  
**Yui:** Tsugumi-san, the way you look out for Kofuki-san\.\.\. It's so precious I can't get enough\!  
**Tsugumi:** Only you could describe aradama management as precious, Yamashiro-san\.  
**Tsugumi:** The reason I do this is because, if there are no aradama around, Shichinosato-san starts to get cranky\.  
**Yui:** Oh come onnn, isn't that what makes it so precious\~\? Or, are you saying you get it\?  
**Tsugumi:** Hmm, I can just never tell how you'll respond to anything\.  
**Tsugumi:** There's many types of people among the investigation team that I'm unused to dealing with, but\.\.\. Yamashiro-san, you're the most extreme of them all\.  
**Tsugumi:** Socializing is hardly my strong suit, but there's no one I've ever had as much trouble understanding as you\.  
**Yui:** That sounds like an incredible appraisal of me, doesn't it\!\?  
**Yui:** If that's how you feel, then please go ahead and learn more about me\! Read me like an open book; I'll answer any question you ask\!  
**Tsugumi:** Ah\.\.\. Then, I have one question\. I realize it's a little late to ask, but, why are you helping with my research\?  
**Yui:** Putting it bluntly, I'm doing it for the money\.  
**Yui:** I get to be together with a real beauty, and I get paid to do it\. Working as a toji is seriously the best job there is\!  
**Tsugumi:** Your expression was different before and after you said that\.\.\. Was there something about it you found hard to tell me\?  
**Yui:** Ahaha, not at all; I love a girl who's perceptive like that\.  
**Yui:** \.\.\.My little sister, she's sick\. That's why I need as much money as I can get\.  
**Yui:** But, don't you think a reason like that's sort of too heavy to bring up\? I mean, when you're fooling around with girls, it's best to keep things a little lighthearted and all\!  
**Tsugumi:** She's sick\?  
**Yui:** Ahaha, I shouldn't have told you all that\. Please just forget it\.  
**Tsugumi:** No, it's good that I was able to see a new side of you\.  
**Tsugumi:** And also, Yamashiro-san\. The experiments you're assisting us with\.\.\. Their results might one day be linked to a cure for your little sister\.  
**Yui:** Will they really\!\?  
**Tsugumi:** Speaking confidentially\.\.\. Research is progressing on whether or not noro can be used to cure diseases\.  
**Tsugumi:** In fact, there have been rumors of a successful test case\.\.\.  
**Yui:** This research can\.\.\. But, how does it work\?  
**Tsugumi:** It's only a rumor, so I'm not very clear on the details\. At most, it should still only be at the fundamental research stage\.  
**Yui:** But still\! It's possible that it could save my sister\.\.\. It might be able to save Miku, wouldn't it\?  
**Yui:** \.\.\.Hearing something like that, there's no way I can sit still about it\!  
**Tsugumi:** Then\.\.\. You might want to go and ask the elite guard about it\.  
**Yui:** The elite guard\?  
**Tsugumi:** Yukari-sama herself is involved with this research, so the people in the elite guard may know something more\.  
**Tsugumi:** Though, it's considered top secret, so I'm not sure if they will tell you\.\.\.  
**Yui:** That's enough for me\! I'm going now\!  
**Yui:** The elite guard\.\.\.  
**Yui:** I guess I'll ask Suzuka-san, since she's from Ayanokouji Martial Arts School too\.  

## [Misogi - Yui: End\]: Things Are Best the Way They Are\!
**Yui:** Hello\! Is Suzuka-san home at the moment\!  
**Suzuka:** \.\.\.This isn't my home, I'll have you know\. Was there something you needed\?  
**Yui:** Actually, there's something I wanted to talk to you about\.\.\.  
**Suzuka:** If it's a love confession, I'll refrain from hearing it\.  
**Yui:** You mean, somebody leaked my private information about how I love Suzuka-san\!\?  
**Suzuka:** Well now, was that actually true\?  
**Yui:** Ahh, so you were just kidding with me\. Here I was getting rejected before I even asked you out\.  
**Suzuka:** Don't you think it's your conduct that causes you to be treated this way\? So\? What was it you really came to see me about\?  
**Yui:** \.\.\.Do you think we could talk about this someplace else\?  
**Suzuka:** It seems this is a rather serious conversation\. \.\.\.Come with me\.  
**Suzuka:** You won't have to worry about us being overheard in here\.  
**Yui:** Thank you very much\! To tell the truth\.\.\. I heard there were experiments in treating people's illnesses with noro, and I wanted to ask you if, maybe you knew anything about it\.\.\. Or something\.  
**Suzuka:** --\!\? Where did you hear about\.\.\. No\. More importantly, why do you want to know\?  
**Yui:** Actually\.\.\. Umm, this is kind of hard for me to say, but\.\.\.  
**Suzuka:** \.\.\.It's about your sister, isn't it\.  
**Yui:** You know about her\?  
**Suzuka:** It's only natural we would gather that much information\. You haven't spoken to anyone else about this\.\.\. Have you\?  
**Yui:** N-No\! As soon as I heard about it, I came right here\.\.\.  
**Suzuka:** In that case, forget all about it\.  
**Yui:** \.\.\.\! B-But, they're researching it, aren't they\!\?  
**Suzuka:** When you have no way of knowing how long it will take before that research can be used for practical purposes, there's no point in placing your hopes on it, is there\?  
**Suzuka:** Your sister is desperately fighting to overcome her illness with modern medical care, and should be gradually getting better\.  
**Yui:** \.\.\.  
**Suzuka:** If you have any time at all to spare speaking about this with me, you should spend it visiting her instead\.  
**Suzuka:** And, you can forget all about that research\. I'm sure that\.\.\. Even if that method could make her better, you would only come to regret it\.  
**Yui:** (\.\.\.What Suzuka-san said is right\. But, still\.\.\.\)  
**Yui:** (If it can make her better, no matter what method it takes, I just want her to be healthy again\.\.\.\)  
**Mirja:** Yamashiro Yui\!  
**Yui:** Eh\?  
**Aradama:** KEEHHHHHH\!  
**Yui:** Uwah\!\?  
**Mirja:** HAAAAAH\!\!  
**Yui:** Th-Thanks for that\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.You aren't acting like your usual self, Yamashiro Yui\.  
**Mirja:** What is it you're brooding over\? Isn't your cheeriness your greatest asset\?  
**Yui:** \.\.\.I'm sorry\.  
**Mirja:** If something is bothering you, why not speak about it\? Telling someone else may lead to you finding the means to resolve it\.  
**Yui:** Then\.\.\. I heard they're researching a new kind of treatment that might cure my sister\. But, someone who knows a lot about that treatment told me I shouldn't place my faith in it\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** It's true that they say progress in the field of medical research is fierce going\. However\.\.\. Is that the only method that can cure your sister\?  
**Yui:** No\.\.\. It's going bit by bit, but she really is getting better now\.  
**Mirja:** Is that research something that will soon be available for use\?  
**Yui:** Umm\.\.\. I think they said, it was still at the stage of fundamental research\?  
**Mirja:** Then, that well informed person was right in what they said\. You can't be certain of when a medical treatment still in the stage of fundamental research will be made available\.  
**Mirja:** This is only in regards to new forms of medicine, but\.\.\. I've heard new medicines can take over a decade of research before they are made for general use\.  
**Yui:** It can take that long\!\?  
**Yui:** (If that's true, then\.\.\. Going the slow and steady way might actually be faster\.\.\.\)  
**Yui:** (I can't be getting all torn up over it now; I've got to keep going at it the best I can, for Miku's sake\!  
**Yui:** Thanks a lot, Mirja-san\! I'm past it now\!  
**Yui:** The girls of the investigation team really are the best there is\!  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.A crying child will soon be laughing, I suppose\. Well, if you've recovered your spirit, then let's leave it at that\.  
**Yui:** Right\! Yamashiro Yui's going at it in full spirit for another day\!

## [Shinsengumi - Sayaka: Start\]: A Sudden Acting Offer
**Kofuki:** Hey, why're we stopping by this place anyway\?  
**Sayaka:** \.\.\.I've been here before\.  
**Mirja:** That's correct\. They said they were experiencing trouble, and made a polite appeal, or rather, a request to us\.  
**Kofuki:** Ooh, there's more aradama-chan here\!\? Well aren't we lucky\!   
**Mirja:** No, it isn't that kind of trouble\. They requested a stuntman for their film\.  
**Kofuki:** Huh\?  
**Sayaka:** \.\.\.Stuntman\?  
**Mirja:** That's right\.  
**Assistant Director:** Ah, it's a good thing you toji girls are here\. A strange rumor started up that aradama show up in our studio, and it's been giving us problems\.\.\. Serious problems\.  
**Assistant Director:** They say there's a high chance of people getting hurt doing stunts here if any aradama come out\. Stuntmen are turning us down\.\.\. All of them, in fact\.  
**Kofuki:** That doesn't mean it's something you ask us to do though\. I'm not doing it either\.  
**Mirja:** Shichinosato Kofuki, I understand your complaint\. However, this is an issue that could be considered secondary damages caused by aradama\.  
**Kofuki:** Secondary damages\?  
**Mirja:** Secondary damages can happen in a variety of ways\. This would be considered a case of harmful misinformation\.  
**Mirja:** Aradama are not commonly appearing here at the moment, but because that has happened in the past, as the director says, unfortunate rumors begin to arise\.  
**Mirja:** We won't be capable of supporting them for years to come, but, whenever possible, it should be our policy to assist them\.  
**Kofuki:** Damnit\.\.\. Making me do the annoying jobs\.  
**Sayaka:** Mai told me about it\. We have to boost the image of toji\.  
**Mirja:** In simpler terms, that's exactly right\.  
**Assistant Director:** With that cleared up, we'd like to ask you to be our stuntman\.\.\. Considering your physique, would you be able to do it\?  
**Sayaka:** You want me to do it\?  
**Sayaka:** I can't do anything like acting\.\.\.  
**Assistant Director:** You won't need to say any lines\.   
**Assistant Director:** What we want is for you to film you leaping around and jumping off rooftops\. It seems like the director had seen toji fighting aradama before, and came up with the idea for this request\.  
**Assistant Director:** We can't afford to delay shooting any longer, and with our lack of time, budget, and suspicious circumstances, we can't arrange to find new stuntmen, so please\!   
**Sayaka:** \.\.\.What should I do\? Kofuki, Mirja\.\.\.  
**Kofuki:** Do whatever you want\. If you don't want to, then say no\.  
**Sayaka:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Sayaka:** If there's something I can do to help\.\.\. I want to do it\. I don't know if I can do it right though\.\.\.  
**Assistant Director:** Thank you\! Really, thank you so much\!  
**Assistant Director:** Here, the director and film crew are waiting over this way\. We can go over the details with them\.  
**Kofuki:** Who'd have thought she'd end up being in a movie, huh-\. Even Sayaka must be pretty shocked right about now\.  
**Mirja:** I'd imagine so\. Though, I was somewhat surprised that Itomi Sayaka decided on it herself\.  
**Kofuki:** Well, yeah\.  
**Mirja:** And also, you have a fairly caring side yourself, to stay to look after her when we aren't even sure of when the filming will end\.  
**Kofuki:** That's just cause, if I went back, it's not like there's anything to do there either\.   
**Mirja:** I see\. At any rate, the filming should be beginning shortly\.   

## [Shinsengumi - Sayaka: End\]: A True to Life Take
**Film Director:** \.\.\.Action, start\!  
**Soldier Actor:** This is the Shinsengumi; we'll be taking you outlaw ronin in\! Don't think you'll get away\!  
**Sayaka:** (After they say that line\.\.\. I jump\.\)  
**Sayaka:** Hah\!  
**Ronin A:** Kh\.\.\. As if I'll go getting caught here\.  
**Sayaka:** (Turn around\.\.\. Face the camera, and act as though you're striking someone\.\.\. One\.\)  
**Sayaka:** YAH\!  
**Ronin B:** Run away, run away\.\.\. Everybody split up\!  
**Sayaka:** (When that person runs, chase him\.\)  
**Sayaka:** (Come around right in front of him, and point the tip of my sword toward him\.\.\. Then done\.\)  
**Ronin B:** Eee\!\?  
**Kofuki:** She's actually not doing that bad\.  
**Mirja:** It should be no difficulty at all for her to jump about and wield an imitation sword like that\.  
**Film Director:** CUUUUUUUT\!  
**Sayaka:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Kofuki:** Yo, nice going\. What was it like\? Giving that a try\.  
**Sayaka:** I only\.\.\. did the things they told me to do\.  
**Sayaka:** It's different, from fighting against aradama or in a sparring match\.\.\. It felt a little strange\.  
**Mirja:** Even so, you performed it expertly\. That haori fit you well too\.  
**Sayaka:** I couldn't tell for myself, but that's good\.  
**Mirja:** That director and assistant director made it clear they were very grateful, so it seems they thought it was a great performance\.  
**Mirja:** They said they were highly impressed you were able to do those movements without the help of wires\.  
**Kofuki:** And that they might come asking for your help again\.  
**Sayaka:** \.\.\.I won't do this again\. I was a little nervous after all\.  
**Kofuki:** That's just cause nothing beats going up against aradama-chan\.  
**Sayaka:** That reminds me, they said they would send us movie tickets\.  
**Mirja:** All we can do now is pray the filming is finished without incident, so the film can be opened to the public\.  
**Sayaka:** Mm\. If this can help boost the image of toji\.\.\. I'll be glad\.  
**Mirja:** I'm sure you won't have to worry about that, Itomi Sayaka\.  
**Kofuki:** There's nothing left to do here, so lets go home already\.
