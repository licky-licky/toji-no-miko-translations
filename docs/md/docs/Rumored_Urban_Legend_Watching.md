## 1: Aradama and a Strange Rumor
**Ruiko:** Every time aradama suddenly show up, I'm hit with the feeling of, we really did get reincarnated in another world, you know?  
**Kofuki:** Wouldn't you guys have to die first to get reincarnated here?  
**Ruiko:** I mean, you're not wrong, but isn't it easier to understand that way? It sums up what's happening.  
**Mii:** I do understand what you're getting at though.  
**Maki:** By the way, Konori. Is there anything we can do to make things more comfortable for you here?  
**Mii:** No, we're fine right now. Thanks for asking. You've done so much for us. It's been a huge help.  
**Chie:** We want to look out for you too, but there might be things we've missed. So, not only you, Konori-san, but if any of you need anything, feel free to ask.  
**Yume:** Biribiri-onee-san. Show me how you make it all crackly again.  
**Mikoto:** Biribiri-onee-san, huh...  
**Mikoto:** Well, it beats being called just "Biribiri" at least.  
**Mikoto:** Since we're indoors, I'm only going to do it a little.  
**Kanami:** Isn't it kinda cool how she can manipulate electricity like that?  
**Sanae:** While we're on the topic Misaka-san can shoot electricity. Shirai-san can teleport. What kind of powers do the rest of you have?  
**Kaoru:** Those kind of powers are pretty exciting, after all. You can't help but want to see more-.  
**Mii:** My power is clairvoyance. Let's see; I could tell you what kind of cakes are inside that box.  
**Mii:** A strawberry shortcake, a cheesecake, a Mont Blanc, and a Pudding a la Mode. They each look delicious.  
**Mai:** Wow... That's amazing, you got them all right.  
**Kanami:** You're all so crazy. What kind of powers do Uiharu-san and Saten-san have?  
**Kazari:** When you look at me so expectantly, I can't help but feel like you'll be disappointed... I have the power to keep whatever I touch at a fixed temperature.  
**Kazari:** Its name is "Thermal Hand", but since I'm just a level 1, I can't do anything significant with it.  
**Ruiko:** Uiharu-. When you put it that way, it makes it hard for a level 0 like me to speak up.  
**Ruiko:** Mine's "Aero Hand", but since my level's too low, the effects of it are too weak to even see-. Sorry about that.  
**Mirja:** No, there's nothing you need to apologize for, Saten Ruiko. It's very interesting being able to learn about the Academy City you come from.  
**Kaoru:** They seriously are from out of this world.  
**Tsugumi:** I'm slightly curious about one point. Level 1, level 0; are they divided based on the power, range, duration, and so on?  
**Kuroko:** In general, it's fine to assume as much.  
**Kuroko:** There exist levels 0 through 5. And, up at the top, among the many espers, there are only seven level 5s. And, one of those seven is Misaka Mikoto-onee-sama herself\!  
**Yume:** Huh, so Biribiri-onee-san's one. Is she that great?  
**Mikoto:** ...Hey, Kuroko\! Do you have to praise me up even after coming to another world? And besides, Shokuhou's a level 5 too.  
**Kuroko:** I only ensured that everyone had a more proper image of you.  
**Kanami:** What kind of power do you have, Shokuhou-san?  
**Misaki:** My power isss--  
**Misaki:** A secret\~\. It's not the kind of ability that's any fun to show off, you know?  
**Kanami:** It isn't...? That's too bad.  
**Kaoru:** Well, everybody's got their own circumstances.  
**Mikoto:** ...Can we talk for a minute?  
**Misaki:** What abouut? I don't have that much time to spend chatting with you.  
**Mikoto:** Under no circumstances are you going to alter these people's memories or anything, right?  
**Misaki:** Sigh... Now why would I go and do that? There's no merit in it for me.  
**Mikoto:** That's fine then.  
**Ruiko:** When you toji are fighting aradama, you can jump around really far. Is that some kind of special power?  
**Maki:** We can enhance our strength like that, using our okatana as a medium.  
**Mii:** Then, is the reason aradama's attacks don't hurt you also because of your okatana?  
**Maki:** That's right. It can temporarily raise our body's endurance.  
**Chie:** As far as defense goes, there's also one more aspect to it. We can apply something called "utsushi".  
**Chie:** It's a technique that converts our bodies to something of a state of pure energy.  
**Chie:** With utsushi applied, even if we were fatally injured, when utsushi is removed, the injury is gone as well.  
**Chie:** There's still some mental damage left over though.  
**Kazari:** It's like a kind of barrier, or like a body replacement technique, isn't it\!  
**Kaoru:** Sure, let's go with that.  
**Mikoto:** From hearing about them, your toji powers... Aren't your skills pretty incredible too?  
**Mii:** They might have been developed to combat aradama, but some are awe-inspiring to see.  
**Yume:** You think so-? Isn't it way cooler if each and everybody has their own power?  
**Maki:** I think we'd both feel that way about the things we're less used to.  
**Maki:** As far as I can tell, there aren't any major issues with you living here, but I hope we can find a method of getting you back home soon.  
**Maki:** We're doing all we can to collect that metal that we sometimes find mixed in with the noro, but we haven't gotten very far. All we can do is wait for more news from the investigation.  
**Ruiko:** That reminds me...  
**Ruiko:** I don't think this has anything to do with the aradama with that metal from Misaka-san's experiment, but I did hear a sorta interesting rumor about an aradama.  
**Kazari:** You really can't stop thinking about rumors and urban legends, can you, Saten-san.  
**Kuroko:** I can't believe you would keep that up even after coming to this world. Could I ask you not to stick your neck into trouble?  
**Ruiko:** I just got curious if there were any urban legends unique to here, so I asked around a little.  
**Tsugumi:** If you've heard an interesting rumor regarding aradama, I'd be interested in knowing more too-. I do research into aradama.  
**Tsugumi:** What was this urban legend about?  
**Ruiko:** I heard that, even though aradama look like scary monsters, there's an aradama that's small and cute too...\!  
**Ruiko:** Though, the toji who told me about it hadn't actually seen it herself.  
**Ruiko:** But still, don't you just want to get to the bottom of this\!\? Is it some kind of mutant? Was it made by some mad scientist's experiment ...My imagination's running wild here\!  
**Kazari:** That's a bad habit of yours, Saten-san.  
**Tsugumi:** Hmm hmm. You're right, that is fascinating. I'd like to know the truth behind it-.  
**Mai:** Umm, isn't that...  
**Kaoru:** ......  
**Kanami:** ...\!  
**Tsugumi:** Though, I am busy, so I won't be able to chase down this mystery. How bothersome-.  
**Ruiko:** In that case, I'll get to the bottom of this one for sure\! It's not like I've got anything better to do anyway\!  
**Tsugumi:** I'll look forward to it then. Ah, but please, don't go doing anything dangerous.  
**Ruiko:** I got it-. Uiharu, starting tomorrow, we've got an important mission to hunt down the truth of an urban legend\!  
**Kazari:** Ehh-- I'm a part of this too-\!\?  
**Kanami:** When we have the time, we'll join you\! You'd be in trouble if you actually ran into an aradama.  
**Ruiko:** Thanks so much\! Whenever you're free, just come on board\!  

## 2: Chasing Urban Legends
**Ruiko:** Thanks for everything-.  
**Ruiko:** Hmm, none of the info I'm getting sounds all that convincing. Though, getting clues bit by bit is the real fun of urban legends\!  
**Kuroko:** Everyone we've asked about about a small cute aradama has given us blank stares or looks of confusion.  
**Mirja:** Aradama are inherently something to be feared. Reactions like those are only natural.  
**Mikoto:** They go on rampages and attack people after all. Are you sure this urban legend isn't just completely made up?  
**Ruiko:** You don't get it, Misaka-san. Even the fact that it might be made up is what makes hunting down the truth so romantic.  
**Sanae:** You really do love this sort of thing, don't you, Saten-san.  
**Ruiko:** More than loving it, it's like it just gets stuck in my head, I guess?  
**Kazari:** And, in the end, we all wound up going along with Saten-san's search for urban legends.  
**Mii:** It's fine, it's fine. I don't have anything else to take care of here either.  
**Mikoto:** Actually, it's strange seeing you of all people coming along. What brought this on?  
**Misaki:** If I were the only one off on my own, the toji would get overly fussy about me, wouldn't they? So. That's. All.  
**Mikoto:** (She has a point there, but the way she said it is annoying...)  
**Ruiko:** Thanks for coming along too, Iwakura-san, Kitora-san.  
**Sanae:** So long as we don't get any emergency calls, we should be fine for today.  
**Kanami:** Saten-saaan. I brought Yume-chan along to pitch in-.  
**Yume:** I don't really care about a tiny aradama, but you onee-sans looked like you're having fun.  
**Mii:** This has turned into a fairly bustling group, hasn't it.  
**Mirja:** Then, what should we do next? It might be a good idea to split into two parties.  
**Kazari:** We looked into that big discount store just now, but you don't seem have any cans of strawberry oden or strawberry monjayaki in this world...  
**Kanami:** We have a few differences, like this side has aradama and your side has special powers, but things are basically the same... So I thought, "Maybe they'll have it\!\" But, no luck...  
**Ruiko:** I thought it'd be good to split up for a bit, but Uiharu, that's what you were looking for\!\?  
**Kanami:** We were just a little morbidly curious. I wanted to know what it'd taste like.  
**Sanae:** Yeah. Uiharu-san said we just had to try it. I thought it might be tasty...  
**Yume:** Mmm, I like strawberry daifuku and stuff a lot, but oden is going too far...  
**Kazari:** It has a highly refined flavor, you know? You can't judge it from appearances alone.  
**Ruiko:** No way, it's pretty much what you'd expect\!  
**Misaki:** Might if I say somethingg?  
**Ruiko:** Don't tell me, Shokuhou-san's a fan of strawberry oden too\!\?  
**Misaki:** What are you talking about? I mean about the aradama we're searching for, of coursee.  
**Ruiko:** Did you come across something important?  
**Misaki:** If there were a cute aradama out there, wouldn't it be possible lots of people might not even recognize it as an aradamaa?  
**Mii:** Now that you mention it...  
**Mirja:** You've honed in on an interesting point, Shokuhou Misaki.  
**Mikoto:** So basically, there could be some kind cute small animal you wouldn't be able to tell was an aradama\!  
**Misaki:** Wasn't that the rumor from the start? Why do you look so happy noww?  
**Kuroko:** It is Onee-sama after all... She's surely picturing some sort of fancy aradama moving about, with an indescribable sense of excitement... What will I ever do with her.  
**Mikoto:** I-I'm not getting excited...  Can you not go making it sound weird?  
**Mikoto:** I was only thinking, maybe there's a cute frog looking aradama, okay\!  
**Yume:** Hmm, you like cute things, Biribiri-onee-san?  
**Mikoto:** ...Well, I do, a little.  
**Yume:** Then, do you like stuff like this?  
**Mikoto:** Ooh... Hey, this is cute... Are these special mascots they only sell in this world?  
**Yume:** This one's called Ichigo Daifuku Neko. It's my favorite.  
**Mikoto:** Then, I'll do you one better...  
**Mikoto:** Here's my Gekota strap\!  
**Yume:** Ahh-. So that's why you were talking about a cute frog looking aradama.  
**Mikoto:** Yep. Isn't it cute\!  
**Ruiko:** Sorry to bust in when you're getting all worked up over your favorite mascots, but... Could we get moving soon?  
**Mikoto:** Y-Yeah, sure. Let's go... Ahaha.  
**Kazari:** At any rate, we can search tomorrow for any information on sightings of strange small cute creatures.  
**Sanae:** I think it's a good idea to follow that line of thinking.  
**Kanami:** (It looks like this'll go fine without us having to do anything unnecessary to help them along. The rest just depends on Kaoru-chan's missions.)  
**Ruiko:** Let's go at it hard again tomorrow\!  
The next day--

  
**Mii:** Just from asking around, it seems like there have been sightings of a small unknown creature in the area.  
**Kuroko:** On top of that, a toji was sometimes seen bringing it around. What's going on here?  
**Chie:** ...Th-That sure is strange.  
**Ruiko:** A toji together with the aradama they're supposed to beat\! That sounds kinda sorta cool, doesn't it?  
**Ruiko:** They say mysteries invite mysteries, but that kind of combo really heats this up.  
**Kazari:** If those are the conditions, then, instead of asking people about town, I think it'd be faster if we started asking toji.  
**Ruiko:** Let's head back to Renpu Girls' Academy\! Since we're getting close to the truth, I want to give a heads up to Shokuhou-san too.  
**Mai:** Mmhm... I think that should work fine too.  
**Mai:** Umm, Chie-san and I have something to take care of, so we'll catch up with you later.  
**Chie:** That's right. If you go from here to Renpu, you shouldn't be in danger of getting attacked by any aradama either.  
**Mikoto:** Thanks for coming along with us, you two.  
**Mikoto:** Anyway, we'll see you later\!  
**Mai:** Phew... I think they're having a good time, but I feel kind of bad.  
**Chie:** I know... We're conspiring with Kaoru-san and the others on the side.  
**Misaki:** ...Even so, it's not as if you had to come all the way to get me.  
**Ruiko:** Come on, we're right at the end. From asking around campus, people said they just saw it here\!  
**Kazari:** But, would there really be an aradama at a toji school?  
**Mii:** And also... They said that a petite toji had a strange small animal riding on her head... It's quite the report.  
**Kuroko:** Then, an eyewitness also said they were headed toward the entranceway. For an urban legend... It's too specific in many ways.  
**Ruiko:** You've got to pin down the truth even with weird things like that, Shirai-san.  
**Mikoto:** We've come this far, haven't we.  

## 3: A Playful Heart and the Rumor's Truth
**Ruiko:** Ah\! Mashiko-san\!  
**Ruiko:** That strange thing riding on your head... Is that it\!  
**Kaoru:** So you made it to the truth, huh. That was faster than I was expecting.  
**Nene:** Nenene-\!  
**Mii:** The toji who got along with the aradama was you, wasn't it, Mashiko-san.  
**Kaoru:** This little guy's the guardian beast of the Mashiko family. We've been together since I was a kid.  
**Ruiko:** Then, that means Etou-san and Yanase-san and everyone must've known, right? You're close and all.  
**Mai:** Sorry for keeping quiet about it.  
**Kaoru:** But hey, it'd feel rude just handing the answer to somebody who's set on chasing it down.  
**Mikoto:** Saten-san was so excited to find the truth at that point, wasn't she?  
**Ruiko:** Well, sure-. As soon as I hear about an urban legend, I can't help it. I get caught up in this feeling, like, "Let's do this-".  
**Kanami:** We wanted to let you have some fun. So, we played along a little, alright?  
**Kanami:** We knew the truth behind the rumor wasn't going to be anything dangerous either.  
**Tsugumi:** I was the first to spur you on. I was telling the truth when I said I was interested in the aradama of the Mashiko family, but I'm sorry to instigate you like that.  
**Ruiko:** Nah, you don't have to worry about it. It was a lot of fun.  
**Ruiko:** And, if you'd just told me the truth straight away, I don't think I would have felt that excitement of getting to the bottom of this.  
**Misaki:** I only went along with you for a little, but it wasn't such a bad way of killing time, was it?  
**Ruiko:** For sure. I got to experience all sorts of things while we were investigating too.  
**Kaoru:** That's all we wanted to hear. Right?  
**Nene:** Ne\~\~\.  
**Mikoto:** It doesn't look like how I pictured it, but... This is cute too... I want touch it.  
**Kaoruko:** In a sense, your reaction was just as I pictured, Onee-sama...  
**Kazari:** What's this little guy's name?  
**Kaoru:** It's Nene.  
**Mirja:** Cases of aradama such as Nene are exceptionally rare, so I'd say none outside of Mashiko Kaoru's acquaintances would believe it. In actuality, Nene has in part become a rumor.  
**Ruiko:** This guy sure is nothing at all like the aradama we've seen so far. Let me pet him.  
**Ruiko:** --Eh, he jumped\!\?  
**Mii:** KYA. Th-That took me by surprise. It's a good thing I caught him at least.  
**Nene:** Ne\~\!  
**Kuroko:** This is... He seems to be somehow attached to you, Konori-senpai.  
**Mikoto:** You're so lucky, Konori-senpai...  
**Mii:** I'm not quite sure why that is myself.  
**Mikoto:** C-Can I try hugging him too? Nene-cha...  
**Nene:** Nene\~\!  
**Misaki:** Honestly, what's with this little guyy... Head on over to Misaka-san already.  
**Kaoru:** Well-, that's just how he is.  
**Chie:** I thought things might turn out this way, when Nene-chan came in touch with Konori-san and Shokuhou-san...  
**Mai:** Ahaha...  
**Ruiko:** Ah-. Does that mean, Nene-chan's...  
**Misaki:** Basicallyy, does that mean he's more attached to girls with bigger bust power? How unfortunate for youu, Misaka-san.  
**Mikoto:** ...\!\?\!\?  
**Kuroko:** Now, now. Onee-sama, you still have me as your partner in skinship. Please love and caress me to your heart's desire.  
**Kazari:** Ahaha... It might cause other problems, but it'd be nice if the other aradama could all be as friendly as Nene-chan here.  
**Ruiko:** Yeah. I think it'd be best if they got along like Mashiko-san and Nene-chan here.  
**Mai:** That's for sure.  
**Kaoru:** Hopefully things could end up like that someday.  
**Mii:** By the way, is there any way of getting along better with Nene-chan?  
**Ruiko:** I wanna know\!  
**Kaoru:** Fine, I guess we can try some things out-. It's not like he doesn't like you or anything, Mikoto.  
**Mikoto:** \!  
**Kaoru:** Nene, c'mere for a sec.  
**Nene:** Nene\~\.

## [Railgun - Kofuki: Start]: It's Bizarre\! The Human Aradama of Renpu Girls' Academy\!
**Ruiko:** Shichinosato-san\! Is it really true that Renpu Girls' Academy is researching human aradamas behind closed doors\!\?  
**Kofuki:** The hell are you talking about?  
**Ruiko:** It's a rumor I've been hearing from all the toji\!  
**Ruiko:** Since I like learning about urban legends, I thought you toji might have some, so I asked a bunch of people\!  
**Kazari:** I'm sorry about her, Shichinosato-san.  
**Kofuki:** Then, why'd you decide to ask me about this? I don't really care about rumors and whatever, y'know?  
**Ruiko:** Even if you aren't interested, you're still a toji at Renpu Girls' Academy, right? And also, I've heard you hang around the research labs a lot.  
**Kofuki:** Well, you're not wrong, but still, human aradama...  
**Ruiko:** It's exciting\!  
**Kofuki:** Like I'd know anything.  
**Ruiko:** What, so it was only a rumor after all-?  
**Kazari:** See, that's what I was telling you. There's no way that kind of thing would be real\!  
**Ruiko:** You say that, but, if it really was real, wouldn't you be interested, Uiharu?  
**Kazari:** In that case... I think I would, a little...  
**Kofuki:** Then, wanna go see the research labs? I was just about to head over there actually.  
**Ruiko:** Can we\!\?  
**Kofuki:** Sure, do whatever you want. Though, whatever happens when you get there, it's not my problem.  
**Ruiko:** W-Whatever happens...? Then, are there really human aradama\!\?  
**Kazari:** S-Saten-san, maybe we should just give up on this...  
**Ruiko:** It sounds interesting\! Let's go, Uiharu\!  
**Kazari:** Of course it came to this...  
**Ruiko:** ...Gulp. This is the lab from the rumors... Shichinosato-san... Wait, huh? She's not here?  
**Kazari:** She was right with us until a minute ago... Wh-Where'd she go?  
**Ruiko:** ...Maybe the toilet?  
**Kazari:** Do you think?  
**???:** Excuse me.  
**Ruiko/Kazari:** HYAAAAAAAA\!\?  
**Ruiko:** I'm sorry, it's not like we wandered in here on our own\! Shichinosato-san just led us here is all\!  
**Kazari:** This is why I told you to stop, didn't I\!  
**Tsugumi:** Really now... This was mean of you, Shichinosato-san.  
**Ruiko/Kazari:** Huh?  
**Kofuki:** Ahahahahaha\! Sorry, sorry.  
**Tsugumi:** Honestly... My name is Ban Tsugumi. You wanted to look in on our research, didn't you? Make yourselves at home.  
**Ruiko:** I-I thought you'd be mad at us...  

## [Railgun - Kofuki: End]: Take it Easy With Gathering Rumors
**Ruiko:** When you suddenly popped out at us, I was thinking, "We're gonna get turned into human aradama experiments\!\"  
**Tsugumi:** Human aradama... Ahh, it's about that rumor, isn't it.  
**Ruiko:** You know about it\!\?  
**Kazari:** Saten-san, let's stop asking them weird questions.  
**Saten:** But, we finally met someone who knows about it\!\? Aren't you curious, Uiharu?  
**Kazari:** Well, I am a little bit curious...  
**Tsugumi:** That rumor is completely made up. We don't carry out experiments fusing humans with aradama or the like here.  
**Ruiko:** So that's all-.  
**Kazari:** Then, what kind of research do you do here?  
**Tsugumi:** We gather data on aradama and toji. To put it simply, we have toji fight with aradama, and we collect the resulting data.  
**Ruiko:** Kind of like that?  
**Kofuki:** ORAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Tsugumi:** Yes, just like that.  
**Ruiko:** Is it alright for us to watch on for a while?  
**Tsugumi:** It's perfectly fine. Just, hold on...  
**Kofuki:** Alright, I'm done\!  
**Ruiko:** Hey, it looks like she just finished beating the aradama too, so let's go\!  
**Tsugumi:** Ah, please wait a moment\!  
**Tsugumi:** Uiharu-san, please stop Saten-san\! The current turn hasn't finished yet\!  
**Kazari:** Ehh\!\? S-Saten-san, hang on\!  
**Ruiko:** Huh?  
**Aradama:** SHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Kofuki:** Hey, what'd you come running in here for\!\!  
**Ruiko:** I-I thought you were finished already\!  
**Kazari:** Are you okay, Saten-san\!\?  
**Kofuki:** You two aren't supposed to be in here\! Whatever\! I'll take care of these guys fast, so just hide in the back\!  
**Ruiko/Kazari:** O-Okay\!  
**Ruiko:** Th-Thank god we're safe...  
**Kazari:** This is all because you didn't listen to Ban-san finish talking.  
**Ruiko:** ...Sorry about that.  
**Kofuki:** Take it easy with chasing these weird rumors, will you.  
**Ruiko:** Right, I'll be more careful about it from now on\!  
**Tsugumi:** ...I notice you didn't say you were going to stop.
