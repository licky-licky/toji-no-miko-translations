## 1: School Life 20 Years Ago
**Minato:** There's no sign of these aradama, huh\.  
**Yukari:** That's true\. But there's no mistaking they're in the area\.\.\.  
**Kagari:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Minato:** Wanna take a break\? At this rate, we'll be worn out by the time we do find them\.  
**Yukari:** Don't\. This amount of exercise shouldn't be enough to tire any of us, should it\?  
**Kagari:** \.\.\.  
**Minato:** But the weather's so nice\.\.\. Yawwwwn, 'scuse me\.  
**Kagari:** Get your act together, Minato-senpai\! Why are you so unmotivated\?  
**Minato:** Ehh, but I've got lots of motivation\.\.\.  
**Kagari:** Start taking this seriously\.  
**Minato:** I am though\. Ah, the spectrum meter found something\!  
**Minato:** C'mon, Yukari, Kagari\!  
**Kagari:** Ah, stay with us, Minato-senpai\!  
**Yukari:** Sigh, Minato\.\.\. Let's go, Kagari\.  
**Kagari:** \.\.\.Right\.  
The next day\.

  
**Yukari:** Finally, there you are\. So you were sleeping out here\.  
**Minato:** Nnn\.\.\. Morning, Yukari\. The sun feels so good\. Wanna join me\?  
**Yukari:** Sigh, I already expect this from you, but\.\.\. Kagari is still upset, you know\?  
**Minato:** Ehhh, but I beat the aradama and everything\.\.\.  
**Yukari:** While you ran off on your own\. What did Kagari tell you yesterday\?  
**Minato:** Uh\.\.\. That I had no motivation\. Is that really how it seems\?  
**Yukari:** I wouldn't say you aren't serious, but you do appear too apathetic\.  
**Yukari:** Suppressing aradama is an important duty\. Just knowing what you're capable of\.\.\. I can understand how Kagari feels\.  
**Minato:** You're kind of putting me on the spot here\.  
**Minato:** I said it yesterday, but it's not like I'm not motivated\. I'm taking this seriously\.  
**Minato:** I guess it's just hard to tell from how I act\?  
**Yukari:** Then make an effort to show it, if even just slightly more\.  
**Minato:** I'll give it my best shot\.  
**Minato:** Anyway, that's gonna be starting soon, isn't it, Yukari\!  
**Yukari:** That\.\.\. The inter-league tournament\?  
**Minato:** Yeah\! I wonder who's gonna be participating this year\? We'll get to fight girls we wouldn't normally get matches with\!  
**Minato:** I already can't wait\!  
**Yukari:** \.\.\.Try putting that enthusiasm into your duties\.  

## 2: What I Like
**Minato:** Excuse meee, anyone around\.\.\.\? Alright\! Let's get cooking\!  
**Minato:** Hmhmhmm\~\.  
**Minato:** Mmm\~, the cup yakisoba's good to go\! Just have to wait 3 minutes now\!  
**Minato:** Nobody can fight on an empty stomach\.  
**Minato:** It's tough training with Yukari, so I've gotta eat up first\!  
**Minato:** \.\.\.Still not ready\?  
**Minato:** One minute\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\. Two minutes\.\.\.  
**Minato:** It's a little early, but whatever\!  
**Minato:** Pour out the water, mix in the sauce\.\.\. Mmm\~\! That smell\!  
**Minato:** Time to dig i--  
**Yukari:** Minato\.\.\. Are you in here\?  
**Minato:** Geh, Yukari\!  
**Yukari:** How nice of you to greet your friend with \"Geh\"\.  
**Yukari:** Knowing you, I assumed you had forgotten our promise to train together\.\.\. But that reaction says otherwise\.  
**Minato:** D-Did I remember, or maybe I forgot, who can say\.\.\.  
**Yukari:** It doesn't matter now\. Let's go; I have some strict training for you\.  
**Minato:** Hang on\! It's my fault I was late to training\! But, before we go\.\.\. Give me enough time to eat this\!  
**Yukari:** I knew I smelled something\.\.\. Is that cup yakisoba\?  
**Minato:** Freshly made, nice and steamy, cup yakisoba\! So please\.\.\. Let it slide just this once, Yukari\.  
**Yukari:** I do know how you feel\. Cup yakisoba is the best when it's freshly made\.  
**Yukari:** It loses its taste after it cools down\.  
**Minato:** Then\.\.\.\!  
**Yukari:** However, that doesn't change your promise\. Our training should be most important to you right now, shouldn't it\?  
**Minato:** Ugh, I can't deny that\.\.\.  
**Minato:** (What should I do; at this rate the yakisoba will cool off and quickly lose its flavor\.\.\.\!\!\)  
**Minato:** (And I don't want to eat any gross yakisoba\! If it comes down to it\.\.\.\!\)  
**Minato:** Yukari\.\.\. Sorry about this\!  
**Yukari:** Mrgh\! \.\.\.(chew chew\)  
**Minato:** Alright, now's my chance\.\.\.\! (slurrrrrrrrrp\)  
**Yukari:** (gulp\) \.\.\.What are you doing, Minato\?  
**Minato:** Ahaha\.\.\. I thought you'd forgive me if I gave you a bite\?  
**Yukari:** You can't call shoving it into my mouth giving me a bite\.  
**Minato:** But it was good, right\?  
**Minato:** Have you ever had cup yakisoba since that time in middle school\.\.\. When you ran away from home\?  
**Yukari:** Actually\.\.\. I've been eating it often\.  
**Minato:** Seriously\!\?  
**Yukari:** Secretly, when I could hide it\.  
**Yukari:** It's difficult to tell anyone I'm eating cup yakisoba\.  
**Minato:** No way\.\.\. Then, next time we train together, we should get cup yakisoba too\!  
**Minato:** We'll stick with that\!  
**Yukari:** \.\.\.Good\. I'll look forward to it\.  

## 3: The Inside Story of the Enforced Regulation
**Minato:** Is this Shikishima Bank\? Somebody's supposed to be holed up in there\.  
**Policeman:** Yes, but\.\.\. Ah, did you hear about it on the news\? You shouldn't be here, it's dangerous\. Run on home\.  
**Minato:** Uhh, I caught some of the news, but I'm the toji who came on behalf of the Special Sword Administration Bureau\.  
**Policeman:** Huh\? A toji\? J-Just wait right here\!  
**Police Inspector:** You say you're the toji the Special Sword Administration Bureau dispatched\.\.\.\?  
**Minato:** That's me\.  
**Police Inspector:** You seem a little young\.\.\.  
**Minato:** Well, I am a toji, so that's pretty normal\. I'm Fujiwara Minato, a 2nd year at Renpu Middle School\.  
**Minato:** I've been sent here on behalf of the Special Sword Administration Bureau to resolve the Shikishima Bank Siege Incident\.  
**Police Inspector:** They sent a middle schooler here to fight\!\? Has the Special Sword Administration Bureau lost their minds\!\?  
**Police Inspector:** They could have at least gotten a high school student\.\.\.\!  
**Minato:** A high schooler's just 2 years older; it's not that big a difference\. And besides, the police are the ones who asked for a toji, right\? That's what I heard\.  
**Police Inspector:** The man in there is armed\. We can't let a kid like you go anywhere near\!  
**Police Inspector:** In the 30 hours since the case started, there's been one casualty after another\. We can't afford to stand by and let another happen\.  
**Police Inspector:** We'll request a change of personnel right away\. Sorry it turned out like this just after you got here, but please go home\.  
**Minato:** Ah, you don't have to do anything like that\.  
**Police Inspector:** What\?  
**Minato:** I'll be finished here in a minute\.  
**Minato:** Mannn, it was pretty crazy back then\.\.\. They kept saying \"Go home, middle schooler\!\"  
**Kagari:** \.\.\.Sigh, of course they did\. Do you understand what happened after that, Minato-senpai\?  
**Minato:** What happened\? Well I got a little famous, right\? It's not that big a deal, Kagari\.  
**Kagari:** Not a big deal\.\.\. We're talking about the Shikishima Bank Siege Incident, you know\!\?  
**Kagari:** Do you have any idea what a thrashing the media gave the police for sending a middle school girl in there\!\?  
**Minato:** Ohh, that\.  
**Minato:** I'm the one who said I was going in, so they were really barking up the wrong tree there\.  
**Kagari:** The police were hardly clear of blame either, when it seems they were hoping the criminal would let his guard down if a child came after him\.  
**Minato:** But the police officer there was really worried about me, you know\?  
**Kagari:** Likely because the officers at the scene hadn't been told what their superiors were planning\.  
**Kagari:** \.\.\.Did you know that, as a result of that incident, a regulation was put in place saying the Special Sword Administration Bureau could no longer intervene in any non-aradama related cases\?  
**Minato:** Really\?  
**Kagari:** \.\.\.\.\.\.Sighhhhh\.  
**Minato:** Please at least try to consider the repercussions of your actions, Minato-senpai\.\.\.  

## 4: Amusement Park
**Minato:** We're at the amusement park\! Yukari\! Yukari\! What do you want to ride first\?  
**Yukari:** You're getting too worked up, Minato\.  
**Minato:** But we finally got to come to the amusement park\! What's the point if we're not getting worked up\?  
**Yukari:** \.\.\.Is that how this works\?  
**Minato:** That's exactly how it works\!  
**Minato:** So, so\? What do you wanna ride, Yukari\? I think we should try the rollercoaster\!  
**Yukari:** I'll leave it up to you\. We can ride that first\.  
**Minato:** Alright-\!  
**Minato:** That was great-\! Wasn't it, Yukari\!  
**Yukari:** Yes, and because it's designed for the general public, it didn't put much burden on your body\.  
**Minato:** Yukari\.\.\. Is that really all you have to say about the rollercoaster\?  
**Yukari:** When you ask me like that, I'm not sure what kind of opinion I'm meant to have\.  
**Minato:** Hmm\.\.\. Yukari, do you have fun at amusement parks\?  
**Yukari:** I'm not sure how to respond to that\. I don't often come to places like this\.  
**Yukari:** So I'm not sure how to have fun here either\.  
**Minato:** Huh\? But don't you start getting excited just being at an amusement park\?  
**Yukari:** Do you\?  
**Minato:** You do\!  
**Minato:** Alright, today is a holiday, and you aren't here to do an inspection\. Got it\?  
**Minato:** Which means nobody's stopping you from having all the fun you want\!  
**Yukari:** \.\.\.I see\. You're right, Minato\. Please teach me how to have fun at an amusement park\.  
**Minato:** Sure thing\! Just leave it all to me\!  
**Minato:** I'll give a lecture on how to enjoy every square inch of the amusement park\!  
**Minato:** First off, we're getting back on the rollercoaster\! While we're riding this time, try letting out a big scream\!  
**Yukari:** A scream\.\.\. I'll try it\.  
**Minato/Yukari:** KYAAAAAA------\!\!  
**Yukari:** Amazing\. All I did was scream, but it was so much more exciting this time\.\.\.\! I suppose it's something you can't understand until you try it yourself\.  
**Yukari:** What will we ride next, Minato\?  
**Minato:** Okay, next up is a classic, the teacup ride\! Come on, Yukari\! I'll show you all kinds of exciting things to do\!  
**Yukari:** Good\!  

## 5: Getting Along
**Minato:** Kagari, come sleep with me\!  
**Students:** They're sleeping together\!\?  
**Kagari:** \.\.\.Minato-senpai, please refrain from saying things that others will misunderstand\.  
**Minato:** Misunderstand what\? We're friends, aren't we\? Remember, we went to that hot spring together\.  
**Students:** Hot spring\!\!  
**Kagari:** Along with Ema-senpai\.  
**Minato:** Whatever, just come take an afternoon nap with me\! I found the perfect spot\.  
**Kagari:** I'm not going to\.  
**Kagari:** \.\.\.  
**Minato:** \.\.\.  
**Kagari:** Minato-senpai, just how long do you plan on following me\?  
**Minato:** Hey, I have something to take care of over this way too, okay\?  
**Kagari:** \.\.\.  
**Kagari:** You also have some business in the training hall, Minato-senpai\?  
**Minato:** Wait\? You're going to the training hall, Kagari\? Me too\! I just felt like getting a little exercise, you know\.  
**Minato:** Then this is where we part ways\.  
**Minato:** Wait\!\? You just said, \"you also have business\", didn't you\!\?  
**Kagari:** You must have misheard me\.　  
**Kagari:** I have work to do now, as Yukari-sama's attendant\. I'll speak with you later\.  
**Minato:** Hey\!  
**Minato:** \.\.\.Nng, she's so stubborn\! But that just gets me more fired up\!  
**Minato:** Yukari\! I'm here to mess around\!  
**Yukari:** \.\.\.Minato, do you think this is a playground\?  
**Kagari:** Minato-senpai, now you're even bothering Yukari-sama\.\.\.\! What are you doing here\!\?  
**Minato:** I told you, messing around\. You should join me, Yukari\. You're gonna work yourself to death keeping this up\.  
**Yukari:** I wouldn't say I've been working myself that hard\.  
**Kagari:** That's enough\! What are you thinking, dragging Yukari-sama into this\!  
**Minato:** I just wanna get along with you, Kagari\.  
**Kagari:** \.\.\.\!\?  
**Yukari:** \.\.\.So she says, Kagari\. Why not go along with her\?  
**Kagari:** But\.\.\.  
**Minato:** Then, how about this\! Kagari and I'll have a match, and the loser has to do whatever the winner says\.  
**Kagari:** \.\.\.That's ridiculous\.  
**Minato:** Don't be like that\~\!  
**Kagari:** \.\.\.Fine, I know you won't give up anyway\. But if I win, I'm going to ask you not to follow me around anymore\!  
**Minato:** If you win\! Alright, you're on\.  
**Yukari:** \.\.\.Fufu, they get along so well\.  
**Minato Joins - Part 1:** The Sea and Mountains in April  
**Minato:** Yeaaaay\! It's the sea, it's the sea\~\! Even though it's still spring back in Kamakura, it feels like summer out here\. Now if we could just find someone selling shaved ice, this'd be perfect\~\.  
**Kagari:** Minato-senpai, I'm sure you're aware, but we came here to suppress aradama\. Not to sightsee\.  
**Yukari:** Kagari is right\. We need to eliminate the aradama first\.  
**Minato:** I knowww\.\.\.  
**Yukari:** Don't sound so depressed; it'll affect our mission\. Here, cheer up\. If we finish quickly enough, we should have spare time for recreation\.  
**Minato:** Oh yeah\! In that case, we just gotta take 'em out quick\. Alright, aradama, bring it on, wherever you are\!  
**Kagari:** The spectrum meter is reacting\.\.\. They seem to be up in the mountains\.  
**Yukari:** We'll head there at once\!  
**Kagari:** That's strange\.\.\. The spectrum meter lost track\.  
**Yukari:** Did they temporarily retreat somewhere\? Until it picks up the signal again, we should find a safe spot to rest\.  
**Minato:** Hmm\~, finding a safe spot's a good idea, but\.\.\. Where are we, anyway\? It looks like a dead end up ahead\.  
**Yukari:** We must be deep in the forest now\. We should turn back the way we came\.  
**Minato:** Huh\? That's weird\. I swear we just passed by here\.\.\.  
**Kagari:** It feels like we've been walking a great distance, but what if we've been walking in circles the whole time\?  
**Minato:** Ehh\!\? Does that mean we're lost\? When you're lost in the mountains, you're supposed to\.\.\.  
**Minato:** If we walk along a stream, it should lead us to a more open area, right\?  
**Kagari:** I see, a stream\.\.\. I heard the faint sound of running water just a moment ago; there should be one nearby\.  
**Yukari:** Wait\. It sounds like a good idea in theory, but what if following the stream led us to a waterfall or rock face\? We wouldn't be able to progress\.  
**Yukari:** If we carelessly follow the stream down, there's a possibility we could only waste our energy and put ourselves in a more precarious position\.  
**Minato:** When you put it like that, you might be right\.  
**Kagari:** How are we meant to find our way down then\.\.\.\?  
**Yukari:** If you have the stamina for it, ascending to the mountain's summit will increase your odds of finding a path back down\.  
**Minato:** Huh\. You know, even though we're the same age, it feels like there's nothing you don't know, Yukari\. I have a lotta respect for that\.  
**Kagari:** The polar opposite of Minato-senpai, who was about to irresponsibly send us down a stream\.\.\.  
**Minato:** What'd you say\!\?  
**Aradama:** KIIIIIEE\!  
**Yukari:** So they showed themselves\.\.\.  
**Kagari:** And there's a lot of them too\. How to efficiently deal with them all\.\.\.  
**Minato:** I've got a good idea for that\! Come on, follow me\!  
**Kagari:** Minato-senpai\? To where\?  
**Yukari:** \.\.\.I get it\. Kagari, follow after Minato\.  
**Minato Joins - Part 2:** Playing in the Water  
**Kagari:** Minato-senpai, the aradama are chasing us; are we not going to fight them\?  
**Minato:** Don't worry about them for now; just follow me\!  
**Yukari:** We reached the stream\. Kagari, we're going to run along it for a little longer\.  
**Kagari:** Eh\? But what about the aradama\?  
**Minato:** Keep following and wait and see\~\! Let's go\!  
**Aradama:** KIEEEEE\!  
**Aradama:** GUOOOO\!  
**Minato:** Nice, the aradama all came after us\. Okay, Yukari, Kagari, it's time to get to work\!  
**Yukari:** Understood\! We're beginning our attack\. TAAAAAAAH-\!  
**Minato:** DORYAAAAAAAA-\!  
**Kagari:** (So the plan was to lure the aradama along the stream and wipe them out all at once\.\.\. I should join in\.\.\)  
**Kagari:** HAAAAAAAAAH-\!  
**Aradama:** Kiiiie\.\.\.  
**Minato:** Awesome, that's all of them wiped out\! My plan went perfectly\~\!  
**Yukari:** That was some quick thinking, confining the aradama here with the stream\. Well done, Minato\.  
**Minato:** It was your advice before that made me come up with it\. If we were really in an pinch, I thought we could drop down the waterfall\.  
**Kagari:** (The judgment to immediately apply information you had just heard as tactics in battle\.\.\. It pains me to admit it, but Minato-senpai is good\.\.\.\)  
**Minato:** Now we can get back to the path\.\.\. Oh yeah\! We were lost, weren't we\?  
**Minato:** Grr, and I thought we could play in the ocean after finishing the aradama this fast-\!  
**Yukari:** Calm down, Minato\. I told you before\. At times like these, we only need to ascend the mountain\.  
**Minato:** Ehh, but we've been running around so much, and you want us to keep climbing\? I'm too tired to move an inch-\! I just wanna head down the mountain and fool around already-\!  
**Kagari:** If you have the energy to spare fooling around, you can make your way up this mountain\. Go on, follow Yukari-sama\.  
**Minato:** Fineee\.\.\.  
**Minato:** Ahh\~, finally, back at the beach-\! I wasn't sure if we'd really find a way down after climbing to the top of the mountain, but Yukari was right like always\~\.  
**Kagari:** And we even found the shortest path right to the beach\.\.\. Minato-senpai's desire to fool around must have been strong enough for the heavens to answer\.  
**Yukari:** At any rate, we made it safely down the mountain, so feel free to use our remaining time here as you wish\.  
**Minato:** Yesss-\! Last one in the water's a rotten egg\!  
**Kagari:** In the water\? It's still only April\. And none of us brought bathing suits\.\.\.  
**Minato:** Just go in like this\? We're all covered in mud from fighting the aradama, so we can clean off while we're at it\!  
**Minato:** See, come on in, Kagari\. Take this\!  
**Kagari:** That's cold-\! Now you've done it, Minato-senpai\. I'll show you\.\.\.  
**Yukari:** It's cold\.\.\.  
**Kagari:** Yu\.\.\. Yukari-sama\! I'm terribly sorry\! I only meant to splash Minato-senpai, but\.\.\.  
**Yukari:** Now that I'm this wet, you leave me no choice\. I'll accept this challenge\.  
**Minato:** That's the spirit, Yukari\! This is how things ought to be\! Kagari, Yukari, let's get this started-\!

## [Mahouka - Minato: Start\]: Three Lost People
**Honoka:** Heeeey\! Kanami-\? Mihono-\?  
**Honoka:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Honoka:** Nnnn, they're not answering, Shizuku\.  
**Shizuku:** Yep\. There's no mistaking it\.  
**Shizuku:** We're lost\.  
**Honoka:** Of course we are\.\.\. Sigh\. And just when they were finally able to take us out sightseeing\.\.\.  
**Shizuku:** We probably weren't separated that far from them\. We should meet up again soon\.  
**Honoka:** Yeah, you're right\.\.\. Okay\! Let's look for them\!  
**\?\?\?:** Sorry, I couldn't help but overhear you\. You're lost, right\?  
**\?\?\?:** If it's alright, want me to help you look\?  
**Honoka:** Are you sure\? Umm, you're\.\.\.\?  
**Shizuku:** Who are you\?  
**Minato:** Me\?  
**Minato:** Actually, I'm lost too\. I came here with two friends of mine, but somehow I got stuck on my own\.  
**Honoka:** Oh, I see\. Since you have an okatana, you must be a toji\.\.\. Wait\? Isn't that okatana\.\.\.\?  
**Minato:** What, Chidori\?  
**Shizuku:** Someone we know has the same okatana\.  
**Minato:** Someone you know\.\.\.\?  
**Minato:** You sure you're not mixing it up\? Chidori's my okatana\.  
**Honoka:** Really\? But, maybe there's another one of that okatana\.\.\.  
**Minato:** There isn't one\.  
**Honoka:** Huh\?  
**Shizuku:** Honoka\. We must just be just mistaken\.  
**Honoka:** \.\.\.That's probably it, Shizuku\.  
**Minato:** \.\.\.Hey, what's this girl like\? The one you think has Chidori\.  
**Honoka:** Umm\.\.\. She's bright and cheery\.\.\. Ah, she kind of feels a bit like you\.  
**Minato:** Hmm\.\.\.  
**Minato:** Alright\. In that case, like I said before, I'll help you look for them\. I want to meet this girl too\.  
**Shizuku:** You sure\?  
**Minato:** Sure thing\!  
**Honoka:** But, you're lost too, aren't you\?  
**Minato:** I'll be fine\. I figure I'll see my friends soon enough, and we might run into them when we're looking for your friends too\.  
**Honoka:** I got it\. Then, let's search together\!  

## [Mahouka - Minato: End\]: Ideal Dream
**Minato:** Hmmm, we aren't finding anybody\.  
**Honoka:** You're not wrong\.\.\.  
**Honoka:** We've been looking for a while now, but, where could they have gone\.\.\.  
**Shizuku:** Honoka\.  
**Honoka:** What is it, Shizuku\?  
**Shizuku:** The koi are swimming up\. Do you think they want food\?  
**Honoka:** What do koi eat, anyway\?  
**Minato:** Koi are omnivores, so they'll eat anything\.  
**Minato:** \.\.\.By the way, I've never seen your uniforms before\. Where's it from\?  
**Minato:** It's not a school from around here, right\?  
**Shizuku:** It's the National Magic University Affiliated First High School\.  
**Honoka:** Sh-Shizuku\!\? Was it really alright telling her\?  
**Shizuku:** We already told Mihono and the others, so why bother now\.  
**Honoka:** Ah\.\.\. You have a point\.  
**Minato:** \.\.\.Magic\?  
**Honoka:** Yes, though you might not believe us\.\.\.  
**Minato:** \.\.\.Well yeah, I'm honestly not sure I believe you\.  
**Shizuku:** But, it's true\. This world is a dream, and Honoka and I come from a different world\.  
**Minato:** \.\.\.A dream\?  
**Shizuku:** That's right\.  
**Minato:** A dream\.\.\. Wait, but\.\.\. Then, is that what's going on\?  
**Honoka:** Is what\.\.\.\?  
**Minato:** You said you knew somebody who has Chidori, right\?  
**Honoka:** Ah, yes\.  
**Minato:** Then, maybe that's the real one\.  
**Honoka:** What do you mean by that\.\.\.\?  
**Minato:** I'm saying, I'm pretty sure mine's just a dream\.  
**Shizuku:** What are you saying, all of a sudden\?  
**\?\?\?:** Minato-senpai\! Where are you-\?  
**Minato:** Ah, looks like I found a friend of mine\. Then, seeya\.  
**Minato:** I think you'll definitely run into yours soon too\.  
**Honoka:** Um, what was your name\.\.\.  
**Honoka:** \.\.\.She's already gone\.  
**Mihono:** Honoka-saaan\! Shizuku-saaan\!  
**Honoka:** Ah\.  
**Kanami:** Thank goodness, we finally found you\! We were looking all over for you two\!  
**Honoka/Shizuku:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** What's wrong\?  
**Shizuku:** Kanami, tell me your okatana's name\.  
**Kanami:** Uh, it's Chidori\.\.\.\?  
**Honoka/Shizuku:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Honoka:** Shizuku, that means\.\.\.  
**Shizuku:** Yep\. We might have seen a ghost\.
