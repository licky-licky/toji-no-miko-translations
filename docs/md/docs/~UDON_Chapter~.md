## 1: The Hero Club's Udon Trip
**TV Reporter:** Now then, for today's feature\.\.\. Here\! It's Japan's big three udon\!  
**Fuu:** Big three udon\.\.\.\!\?  
**Fuu:** There's no time to waste\!\!  
**Fuu:** I want to go eat the big three udon\!  
**Fuu:** For that cause, since Konohana-san was busy with work, I had Satsuki-san come in her place\!  
**Yomi:** I am Satsuki Yomi, third seat of the elite guard\.  
**Yomi:** The instructions I received were to treat the Heroes to udon\.\.\.  
**Yuuna:** Yes, I have a question\! What are the big three udon\?  
**Yomi:** There is a wide variety of types of udon\.  
**Yomi:** Among those, the especially famous Sanuki udon, Inaniwa udon, and Mizusawa udon are collectively called the big three udon\.  
**Itsuki:** What type of udon is it that we usually eat\?  
**Yomi:** Since you are all from Shikoku, if I were to guess, it's likely Sanuki udon\.  
**Tougou:** Sanuki\.\.\. That's right, in the past, Kagawa was once known as the Sanuki Province\.  
**Yomi:** Sanuki udon is very well known, and popular among people across the country\.  
**Fuu:** That's our udon alright\! So then, let's start by having some Sanuki udon\!  
**Yomi:** I've procured enough udon for all of you from a local shop famous for their Sanuki udon\. Here you are\.  
**Heroes:** Let's give it a try-\!  
**Fuu:** [slurrrp]\.\.\.\!\? It's\.\.\.  
**Karin:** It's good, but\.\.\. Something's different, isn't it\?  
**Sonoko:** I think it doesn't have enough body to it\~\?  
**Yomi:** I think the udon here is plenty delicious, though it may have lost some flavor compared to what you might find in its place of origin\.  
**Tougou:** What that means is, if we want to eat the true big three udon, we'll have to travel to their homelands\.  
**Yuuna:** Where does Inaniwa udon and Mizusawa udon come from\?  
**Yomi:** Inaniwa udon is from Akita, and Muzusawa udon is from Gunma\.  
**Yuuna:** Akita\? Gunma\?  
**Tougou:** Regions that once existed in Japan\. Akita was in the area known as Tohoku, and Gunma was in the area known as Kanto\.  
**Yuuna:** Hmmm\.\.\. I have a feeling we went over that in history class\!  
**Yomi:** (In history class\.\.\.\? I had been told what to expect, but they really are strange people after all\.\.\.\)  
**Sonoko:** We can always eat Sanuki udon when we go back home, but I want to eat Inaniwa udon and Mizusawa udon from their hometowns\~\!  
**Tougou:** You shouldn't be so imposing, Sonocchi\. We can't go all the way to Akita and Gunma only to eat some udon\.  
**Yomi:** We are working on a strict schedule, but that wouldn't be so unreasonable\.  
**Yomi:** If tomorrow would be fine with you, do you want to go\?  
**Fuu:** [SLURRRRRP]\! Please take us, Satsuki-san\! Tomorrow, the Hero Club sets out on their udon journey\!  
**Fuu:** Anyway, we'll have to stock up on energy\! Let's get seconds\!  
**Itsuki:** Onee-chan, that's your third\.\.\.  
The next day, the Heroes and the toji gathered before the break of dawn\.

  
**Yuuna:** Yawn\.\.\. Morning, everybody\! Isn't it fun, us all leaving this early\! Kind of like a field trip\!  
**Tougou:** Thinking of breakfast, I borrowed a kitchen and made us some botamochi\.  
**Tougou:** If anyone wants any, here you are\.  
**Sonoko:** I do I do\~\.  
**Ellen:** Oh\! Is it alright for me to have some botamochi too\?  
**Ellen:** [chew chew]\.\.\. Mmm, it's delicious\!  
**Tougou:** That golden colored hair, those blue eyes, and\.\.\. That well pronounced English\! Are you perhaps a \"westerner\"\!\?  
**Ellen:** My mama is American\. I'm Kohagura Ellen, a first year at Osafune Girls' Academy\!  
**Ellen:** I wanted to spend some time with you Heroes, so I'm tagging along on the udon tour\! Let's have some fun today\!  
**Tougou:** An American wants to try udon\.\.\.\?  
**Ellen:** Yes\! Udon tastes so good\!  
**Tougou:** No one who enjoys udon could be a bad person\.\.\. We'll welcome you along, Ellen-san\.   
**Yuuna:** Udon sure is powerful\! It even made Tougou-san fast friends with someone from America\!  
**Hiyori:** Is that really something that shocking\?  
**Yuuna:** It really is\! \.\.\.Wait, huh\? Umm\.\.\. Who are you\?  
**Hiyori:** Juujou Hiyori\.  
**Hiyori:** A friend of mine is from Gunma, but she couldn't come today because of a mission, so I came in her place to show you about Mizusawa udon\.  
**Yuuna:** Yay-, thank you\! I'm so excited to try Mizusawa udon\! Nice to meet you, Hiyori-chan\!  
**Hiyori:** Y-Yeah\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** (S-Seems like she's the type to act close from the moment you first meet\.\.\.\)  
**Yomi:** Everyone is here, so let's move out\. First, in Akita\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** Hold on, Satsuki Yomi\. The Mizusawa udon place Iwakura-san reccomends closes its doors before noon\.  
**Hiyori:** Could we go to Gunma first instead\?  
**Yomi:** If that's the case, then I understand\.  
**Hiyori:** Good then\. Now I should be able to promote Mizusawa udon like Iwakura-san wanted\.  
**Yuuna:** If the store closes before noon, then I'm really looking forward to it\!  
**Sonoko:** Come on, let's go, Gunma\!  
**Hiyori:** From the map she gave me, it should be just ahead\.\.\. Nn\? That's weird; it's closed\.  
**Itsuki:** There's a sign up\. \"As we can't restock, the store is temporarily closed\"\.\.\. Ehh\!\?  
**Ellen:** You say there's\.\.\. an aradama infestation at the local spring\?  
**Mizusawa Udon Seller:** That's right\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** Without being able to get your usual springwater, you can't open shop then, can you\.\.\.  
**Yuuna:** I won't let them get away with causing trouble for someone selling udon\! That's too mean\!\!  
**Mizusawa Udon Seller:** I'm begging you, please do something about those aradama\! If I can just get a hold of that water\.\.\. I'll treat you to the ultimate Mizusawa udon\!  
**Hiyori:** What should we do\?  
**Yomi:** The mission I was given was to escort the Heroes on their udon tour\.  
**Yomi:** And, as toji, suppressing aradama is our duty\.  
**Karin:** There's no reason to think any harder about it then\.  
**Yuuna:** That's right\! As Heroes, we can't ignore these aradama causing problems for everyone either\!  
**Tougou:** We'll defeat the aradama to bring back the Mizusawa udon\. And then we can eat it\. It's two birds with one stone\.  
**Itsuki:** After coming all this way, you can't help but be hungry for Mizusawa udon, can you\!  
**Sonoko:** Let's stop the aradama and get back the spring\~\!  

## 2: Gunma: The Ultimate Mizusawa Udon
**Yuuna:** Alriiight\! Let's go stop those aradama\! We're going to have that Mizusawa udon for sure-\!  
**Heroes:** Yeah-\!  
**Ellen:** You Heroes sure do love udon, don't you\. Is there some special reason for that\?  
**Ellen:** Don't tell me, is udon the source of your hero power\!\?  
**Fuu:** That's not completely off the mark, in the sense that we grew up eating udon\.\.\.  
**Fuu:** The source of our hero power\.\.\. That would be udon and the girl power hidden deep in our hearts\!  
**Tougou:** It's Fuu-senpai's pet theory that udon will raise your girl power\.  
**Ellen:** Girl power\.\.\. I see\! That must be why you're all so cute\!  
**Yuuna:** Hey, Hiyori-chan, what's Mizusawa udon like\?  
**Hiyori:** What makes Mizusawa udon distinct is its pale white noodles\. They're usually served as chilled zaru udon, but the dipping sauce will depend on where you eat it\.\.\. Or so I hear\.  
**Sonoko:** Pale white noodles, hmm\. This udon sounds like a real beauty\~\.  
**Hiyori:** And also, compared to your average udon noodles, it's supposed to be a little bit thicker\.  
**Itsuki:** If the noodles are thick, then it should already have plenty of body to it\.  
**Hiyori:** Ah, about that, I was told it's not as if the noodles have more body than Sanuki udon\.  
**Karin:** Hiyori, why do you keep saying \"supposed to be\" or \"I was told\" and that sort of thing\?  
**Hiyori:** I'm only passing on the information from a friend of mine who loves Mizusawa udon\.  
**Hiyori:** I don't know much about Mizusawa udon either\. So I'm looking forward to it too\.  
**Fuu:** If that's how it is, let's beat up those aradama and get some udon ASAP\!  
**Yomi:** I've sighted the aradama\. Are you prepared for battle\?  
**Yuuna:** I'm ready anytime\!  
**Yomi:** Then, let's begin\.  
**Yomi:** Now, as the spring has been safely recovered, the Mizusawa udon has been prepared\.  
**Yomi:** Here you are, everyone\. Let's begin eating\.  
**Everyone:** Let's eat-\!  
**Yuuna:** It's just like Hiyori-chan told us; these noodles are so pretty\!  
**Sonoko:** I know\~\! And this udon is so good it holds up to our udon back home\~\!  
**Tougou:** The noodles aren't quite as thick as I was expecting, so it's easy to eat\.  
**Ellen:** It's delicious\!  
**Karin:** This sesame sauce pairs with it pretty well too\.  
**Itsuki:** Yes\! It tastes very good\!  
**Fuu:** [slurrrp]-\! These cold noodles go down easy after all the exercise we just did\!  
**Fuu:** I'll have another\!  
**Fuu:** [slurrrp]-\!  
**Fuu:** With the way the taste changes, between this slightly sweet sesame sauce and the soy sauce, I feel like I could eat as many bowls as they put in front of me\!  
**Fuu:** I'll have another\!  
**Fuu:** [slurrrp]-\!  
**Fuu:** Good thing they have this tempura here as a palate cleanser\! It helps reset the appetite\!  
**Fuu:** I'll have another\!  
**Fuu:** I'll have another\!  
**Hiyori:** Y-You're going to keep on eating\.\.\.\? Where are the noodles disappearing to\?  
**Ellen:** Maybe they're being converted into hero energy\?  
**Ellen:** Either way, she has such a healthy appetite\! She's a big eating fighter\!   
**Fuu:** [slurrrp]-\! Another\!  
**Itsuki:** I'm sorry about her, Onee-chan is just\.\.\.  

## 3: Akita: The Supreme Inaniwa Udon
**Yomi:** Next is Inaniwa udon\. Our destination is Akita\.  
**Fuu:** The taste of Mizusawa udon totally lived up to the name of Japan's big three udon\. I can't wait to try Inaniwa udon too\!  
**Hiyori:** After that many extra helpings, you can still fit in more\.\.\. That's really something\.  
**Itsuki:** What is Inaniwa udon like\?  
**Yomi:** From your perspective, Inaniwa udon will be a thin type of udon\.  
**Tougou:** Thin\? Do you mean like somen\?  
**Yomi:** Yes, it would be fine to think like that\. It is a type of udon just thicker than somen\.  
**Sonoko:** A thin type of udon\.\.\. An unknown type of udon just entered the picture\~\.  
**Yomi:** I've made a reservation at the restaurant\.  
**Yomi:** I can assure you the taste will be delicious, so please look forward to it\.  
**Yuuna:** So it gets Satsuki-san's seal of approval\! How soon before we get to Akita\!  
**Karin:** Just hope the place wasn't shut down by aradama again\.  
**Tougou:** Fufu, something like that wouldn't happen twice in a row\.  
**Yomi:** Hello\. We have a reservation, under Satsuki\.  
**Inaniwa Udon Restaurant Clerk:** You must be Miss Satsuki then\. I apologize, but\.\.\. Speaking honestly, it seems aradama have appeared along our transport route, and we've been unable to restock\.\.\.  
**Karin:** Ehhh\!\? This again\!\?  
**Fuu:** Geez, this is all your fault, Karin\. You had to go and put up that weird flag\.  
**Karin:** What do you mean, flag\!\?  
**Itsuki:** Still\.\.\. Why are all these udon related places being affected by aradama\?  
**Fuu:** The aradama just don't understand the deliciousness of udon\.\.\. That's why they're making trouble for anyone selling it\!  
**Sonoko:** The enemies that come out in our world, the vertex, I've heard they'll completely ignore a bowl of udon too\~\.  
**Sonoko:** Aradama and vertex; something so inhuman can never understand the greatness of udon\~\!  
**Yuuna:** If only they could tell how delicious udon is, we might be able to come to terms with each other\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** Uh, I don't think udon is going to help us reach a mutual understanding\.\.\.  
**Fuu:** Anyway, just like in Gunma, all we have to do is stop the aradama, right\?  
**Inaniwa Udon Restaurant Clerk:** I-If you would\! Once we can restock, then we could prepare for you a supreme Inaniwa udon\!  
**Ellen:** Yes\! Let's defeat the aradama and have some tasty Inaniwa udon\!  
**Heroes:** Yeah-\!  
**Fuu:** We've been chasing the aradama for so long the sun's completely set\.  
**Itsuki:** We're on a straight trip, so it was bound to happen\.  
**Hiyori:** Come to think of it, I haven't seen Satsuki Yomi for a while\.  
**Ellen:** Oh, really\? Where could she have gone off to\?  
**Yomi:** Did she get lost\!\? That's dangerous; we have to go look for her\!  
**Hiyori:** Satsuki Yomi is a member of the elite guard\. I don't think we need to worry about her at all\.\.\.  
**Fuu:** My girl power is calling out to me\.\.\.  
**Karin:** That's just your stomach growling\.  
**Yuuna:** But, aren't you feeling hungry by now\?  
**Yomi:** In that case, have some omusubi\.  
**Hiyori:** Satsuki Yomi\!\?  
**Ellen:** Where did you go\?  
**Yomi:** I thought you would all be hungry on this lengthy mission, so while suppressing the aradama, I stopped to procure us food\. I bought them somewhere I regularly get omusubi from\.  
**Sonoko:** These are\! Such nice omusubi\! The rice is glistening\~\!  
**Yomi:** I will vouch for their taste\.  
**Itsuki:** Ah\.\.\. This is some tasty rice\.  
**Yomi:** Thank you\.  
**Karin:** The more you chew it, the sweeter it gets\.\.\. Mm, the saltiness is good enough on its own\.  
**Yomi:** You're very familiar with this, Miyoshi-san\.  
**Yomi:** You should have some too, Juujou-san, Kohagura-san\.  
**Hiyori:** Thanks\.\.\. Mm, it is good\.  
**Ellen:** I'm back at 100%\! Let's beat these aradama quick and reclaim that Inaniwa udon\!  
**Yomi:** You did good work today, everyone\. Now then\.\.\. Let's eat\.  
**Everyone:** Let's eat-\!  
**Yuuna:** Look, Tougou-san\! It's completely different from how our udon is\!  
**Tougou:** It really is like somen noodles\. But, the taste\.\.\. It tastes properly like udon\.  
**Sonoko:** It's different from the udon we're used to, but this is tasty too\~\!  
**Fuu:** Since the noodles are this thin, no matter how much you eat, it has to be low-calorie for sure\. It's very healthy\!  
**Itsuki:** I don't think that's right, Onee-chan\.\.\.  
**Karin:** Each of the big three udon tasted good, didn't they\.  
**Yomi:** About that\.\.\. Sanuki and Inaniwa are considered staples of the big three, but there are actually many candidates for the third position\.  
**Fuu:** Eh\!\?  
**Yuuna:** If there's that many candidates, that means there's that many kinds of tasty udon\!\? Nnn, I want to try them\!  
**Itsuki:** But, after today, we're all full\.\.\.  
**Fuu:** Okay-, after we get back to Kamakura, we can look up other big three udon candidates and start preparing for our next udon tour\!  
**Heroes:** Yeah-\!  
**Hiyori:** There's just no limit to your passion for udon, is there\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** It is the source of their power, after all\!

## [Yuusha 2: Hiyori: Start]: Toji and Heroes-- The Stoic Pair
**Sonoko:** We'll see you off from here\~\.  
**Kanami:** Hiyori-chan, I know your aradama mission with Karin-chan will be a bit of a long trip, but do what you can\.  
**Hiyori:** Sure, you don't have to worry\.  
**Kanami:** I wanted to come along, to see more of Karin-chan's dual wielding, but it was too much when I have a mission of my own\. That's a little disappointing\.  
**Hiyori:** As always\.\.\. You act the same towards everyone when swordfighting is involved\. Well, that's how you are\.  
**Kanami:** I mean, she can dual wield, can't she\? Yukari-sama and Shichinosato-san can do it too, but it's not something you get to see all that often, is it\?  
**Sonoko:** Nibosshi, you get along with her without fighting, okay-\? Also, here's 500 yen for snacks\.  
**Karin:** Am I going on a field trip\!\? What if they think us Heroes can't take things seriously\!  
**Sonoko:** For your snacks-- Don't you think it would be best to re-energize with some sugar when you get a break\? And also, Niboshi don't count as snacks, so don't worry about that\~\.  
**Karin:** Of course they don't\. Niboshi form a complete diet\.  
**Hiyori:** (\.\.\.Niboshi\? Niboshi, huh\.\)  
**Hiyori:** Anyway, we should leave\.  
**Karin:** That's right, we won't get anything done waiting around here talking\.  
**Kanami/Sonoko:** Have a safe trip-\!  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Karin:** \.\.\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** (At times like these, the sensible thing to do would be to find something to talk about, wouldn't it\?\)  
**Hiyori:** (In that case\.\.\. Alright\.\)  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.Hey\.  
**Karin:** \.\.\.Hey\.  
**Hiyori:** Ah, oh\. You can go ahead, Karin\.  
**Karin:** I wasn't going to say anything important\. You can say what you were going to first\.  
**Hiyori:** Alright\.\.\.\. Well, let's work together today\. I've seen the way you fight, so I don't think we'll have anything to worry about\.  
**Karin:** I made up my mind to help out, and I'll see it through\. You can rely on me\.  
**Karin:** It'll depend on how many aradama there are, but what if I soften them up, and you finish them off\? That should be the most efficient course of action\.  
**Hiyori:** That should be fine\. I was thinking of following the same plan once we got to the site\.  
**Karin:** That's good then\.  
**Hiyori:** What were you about to say before\?  
**Karin:** Would it be difficult to completely and fully eliminate all the aradama\?  
**Karin:** There are people living in the town\. And aradama appear there\.\.\. No matter how you look at it, they're living right next door to danger\.  
**Hiyori:** If we could do that, that would be for the best\. Though, unfortunately, we still haven't found an effective way of doing that\.  
**Karin:** \.\.\.So if it were possible, you would have surely done it long ago\. Sorry for asking something strange\.  
**Hiyori:** No, I don't mind\.  
**Hiyori:** You're a\.\.\. You're a kind person, Karin\. Without a second thought, you're worried for the people in our world too\. Though, everyone in the Hero Club seems that way\.  
**Karin:** I-Isn't that just normal\.\.\.\? That kind of attitude\. All of you too, if you came to our world and had the strength to fight our enemies, you'd do it, wouldn't you\?  
**Hiyori:** That's true\. I'd hope so\.  

## [Yuusha 2: Hiyori: End]: Niboshi and Chocolate Mint
**Karin:** TORYAAA-\! --HAAH\!  
**Aradama:** AAAAaaaa\.\.\.  
**Karin:** Now, Hiyori\!  
**Hiyori:** Right\! --HAAAAHH\!  
**Karin:** There don't seem to be any more aradama in sight for now, but what do you think\?  
**Hiyori:** Judging from the report, there should be a few more of them, but we don't seem likely to make contact with any more around here\.  
**Hiyori:** Why don't we move positions some while keeping on the alert\.  
**Karin:** Alright\. We should rehydrate now, while we have the opportunity\.  
**Hiyori:** Good idea\. [gulp gulp]\.\.\.  
**Karin:** I'll take some supplements too\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** \!\?  
**Hiyori:** (Just how many does she have\!\?\)  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.Hey, why are you taking so many supplements\?  
**Karin:** It's a part of keeping my body in healthy condition, of course\. If I were getting sick often, I wouldn't be able to function as a Hero\.  
**Hiyori:** You have a point, but can't you get the nutrition you need from proper meals\?  
**Karin:** \.\.\.I do eat proper meals too, whenever possible\. [crunch crunch]\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.And after supplements, you pull out niboshi\.  
**Karin:** You see, niboshi doesn't just give you calcium, but also a whole host of vitamins, DPA, and EHA\.  
**Karin:** And, since all the varieties of niboshi means you'll never get tired of it, it wouldn't be unreasonable to call it the perfect food\.  
**Hiyori:** You like niboshi, huh\. So that's why they called you \"Nibosshi\"\.  
**Karin:** Sonoko's the only one who calls me that, okay\.\.\.\!  
**Karin:** Here, do you want some too\?  
**Hiyori:** I guess I'll have some\. Prioritizing your health is just as important for a toji\.  
**Hiyori:** [crunch crunch]\.\.\. These are good\.  
**Karin:** Aren't they\? I'm glad I got paired with someone who can understand the quality of niboshi\.  
**Hiyori:** I do like Japanese foods\. I eat niboshi too, from time to time\.  
**Karin:** What's your favorite food, Hiyori\?  
**Hiyori:** That would be nimono, and\.\.\. Chocolate mint\.  
**Karin:** You said you liked Japanese foods\.\.\. I didn't expect to hear chocolate mint from you\.  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Karin:** If you think up a type of chocolate mint you'd recommend, then let me know\. I want to try it\. Before I go back to our world\.  
**Hiyori:** \! Sure, you can look forward to it\!  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.Sorry, I didn't mean to raise my voice just now\.  
**Karin:** Hiyori\.\.\. You love chocolate mint a lot, don't you\.  
**Hiyori:** I-I won't deny that\. Anyway, let's go look for the rest of the aradama\.  
**Karin:** This one is a bit bigger and more of a handful\.\.\. But, with Hiyori and I, we can manage\!  
**Hiyori:** --This is the finish\!  
**Karin:** Was that the last one\?  
**Hiyori:** Yeah\. We finished suppressing the aradama sooner than scheduled\. Thanks; it's because I had your help\.  
**Karin:** It wasn't any trouble for me to come along\.  
**Hiyori:** This one's only chocolate mint flavor convenience store ice cream, but it's pretty good\.  
**Karin:** I'll have some then\. \.\.\.Nn\!  
**Karin:** No wonder you recommended this; this is great\.  
**Hiyori:** That's good to hear\.\.\. Sometimes, you get someone making senseless comments like \"chocolate mint is toothpaste\"\.  
**Karin:** Isn't that because toothpaste is just mint flavored, and not that chocolate mint tastes like toothpaste\?  
**Hiyori:** You got it, you really get it\. It's such a relief you're one of the ones who understands, Karin\.  
**Karin:** It's not that big a deal\. Come on, we should head back soon\.  
**Hiyori:** That's true\. I still have plenty more to recommend you\. I'll give you the rest of them on the train\.  
**Karin:** Hey\.\.\. They aren't all chocolate mint, are they\?

## [Yuusha 2: Kiyoka: Start]: To Boost Up Our Girl Power\!
**Kiyoka:** This time, the two of us will be suppressing aradama as a pair\. You might not be able to rely on me for much\.\.\. But I look forward to working with you\.  
**Fuu:** That's not true at all\. I'll be counting on you, Kiyoka\.  
**Kiyoka:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** (Th-That's right\. A hero like Fuu-san might be helping to clear out the aradama\.\.\. But this is where a toji like me needs to get it together\.\.\.\!\)  
**Kiyoka:** Umm\.\.\. Then, let's give it everything we've got, Fuu-san\!  
**Fuu:** Are you maybe feeling a bit nervous today\?  
**Kiyoka:** Ah\.\.\. No, it's not like that\!  
**Fuu:** Then, that's fine, but it's not good for you to go all out all the time, alright\?  
**Fuu:** If you can't show your strength when it counts, you'll be in trouble, won't you\?  
**Kiyoka:** You're right about that\. To tell the truth\.\.\. I was feeling like I had to try even harder than usual\.  
**Fuu:** That feeling's important too\. There's not a single thing wrong with feeling that way\.  
**Kiyoka:** How is it you can be so calm, Fuu-san\? You're going through so much trouble, coming to our world and then helping us fight aradama, and yet\.\.\.  
**Fuu:** It's because I'm the leader of the Hero Club\. Who's going to follow me if I don't take everything in stride\?  
**Fuu:** Though it's not really like that\. It's hard for me to put in words, but, well\.\.\. We're the ones who decided to help out defeating the aradama, and we know we can trust you toji\.  
**Fuu:** Anyway, if things get bad, I can just weaken the aradama with my overflowing girl power, so I'll be counting on you to finish them off, Kiyoka\.  
**Kiyoka:** Your overflowing\.\.\. Girl power\!  
**Aradama:** GUGGGGGIIII\.\.\.\!\!  
**Fuu:** Ah, there they are\!  
**Kiyoka:** Let's go, Fuu-san\!  
**Kiyoka:** \.\.\.And so that's what happened\. She was a big help, getting me over my strange nervousness and finishing up our mission\.  
**Itsuki:** Onee-chan is good at picking up on things like that\.  
**Kiyoka:** Fuu-san has a strong sense of leadership, doesn't she\. It's a different from Mirja-san, but I found myself depending on her before I knew it\.  
**Kiyoka:** On top of that, she's so cool and feminine\.  
**Itsuki:** Hmmm\.\.\. I feel like you're the more feminine one, Kiyoka-san\. You know so much about fashion, and the way you accessorize is cute too\.  
**Kiyoka:** I'm not that\.\.\. I still have a long ways to go\. I also heard about Fuu-san that her cooking is her specialty\.  
**Itsuki:** Onee-chan's cooking is delicious\. She does all the chores around home too\.  
**Kiyoka:** She's incredible\.\.\. I really look up to her\. I might've wanted to have a big sister like that myself\.  
**Fuu:** What do you think, Itsuki\? About your reliable big sister you're so proud of\.  
**Itsuki:** Come on, Onee-chan\. You're letting it go to your head\.  
**Kiyoka:** Fuu-san\!  
**Fuu:** Ah, sorry for getting caught up in the moment\.  
**Kiyoka:** I\.\.\. I want to learn to be as feminine as you are, Fuu-san\! Could I ask you to give me special training to raise my girl power\.\.\.\!\?  
**Itsuki:** Ehh\.\.\.\!\? Um, Kiyoka-san\.\.\. I think it would be best if you didn't go there\. About Oee-chan's\.\.\. girl power\.\.\.  
**Fuu:** I hear your request loud and clear\. I don't know how long it will take, but I'll do all I can to help boost your girl power, Kiyoka\!  
**Kiyoka:** Ah, thank you very much\.\.\. Fuu-san\!  
**Fuu:** The road to improving your girl power is steep and perilous\. We'll start your training straight away, Kiyoka\!  
**Kiyoka:** Okay\!  
**Itsuki:** Th-They'll be fine\.\.\. Probably\?  

## [Yuusha 2: Kiyoka: End]: The Key to Raising One's Girl Power is\.\.\.
**Tougou:** Hey, Itsuki-chan\? We just ate a little while ago, so why are Fuu-senpai and Kiyoka-chan sitting in front of bowls of udon\?  
**Itsuki:** That's because\.\.\.  
**Fuu:** There's lots of things that can boost your girl power, like practicing cooking and stuff, but the most effective method is udon\!  
**Kiyoka:** Udon\!\?  
**Fuu:** That's right\. Udon is packed with all the ingredients you need for girl power\! And-, with enough girl power, you can do anything-\!  
**Kiyoka:** I-I got it\!  
**Kiyoka:** (I don't exactly understand\.\.\. why eating udon is meant to make you more feminine\. But I just have to have faith in Fuu-san for now\.\)  
**Fuu:** Now, eat up the udon that's loved by all across the nation, and raise up your girl power\!  
**Kiyoka:** Udon is loved on that kind of level in the world you came from\!\?  
**Fuu:** Sure; udon is at the very tip top of gourmet food\. Come on, while it's still hot\!  
**Kiyoka:** I-I'll give it a try\.\.\.\!  
**Fuu:** [chew chew]\.\.\. Even in this world, udon's still the best\! \.\.\.It's filling me up\!  
**Kiyoka:** Yes\.\.\. It's very tasty, isn't it\!  
**Fuu:** I think I'll just keep going on into seconds\.\.\.\?  
**Kiyoka:** [chew chew]\.\.\. A-Already\!\? I-I have to\.\.\. try harder too-\!  
**Tougou:** Ahh\.\.\. You can't do that, Kiyoka-chan\. If you try to have as many helpings as Fuu-senpai\.\.\.  
**Fuu:** Thank you for coming along to the Inubouzaki Fuu-style Girl Power Boosting Special Training\.  
**Kiyoka:** I'm sorry, but\.\.\. Fuu-san\? We ate udon and then exercised together, but I don't feel like I've gotten any more girl power yet\.\.\.  
**Fuu:** Girl power is something that exudes on its own\. You might not feel it right away, but when you do, you'll know for sure it's gone up\. Believe you me\!  
**Kiyoka:** Girl power exudes on its own\.\.\. You sure know your stuff, Fuu-san\.  
**Kiyoka:** I understand then\! Now, let's go and do a good job of suppressing aradama again today\.  
**Kiyoka:** Ah\! There's a big park nearby here\. I don't want to let the aradama come near it\.  
**Fuu:** Of course\. We wouldn't want anyone to get hurt\.  
**Fuu:** Kiyoka\! I drove it over your way\! I'm counting on you\!  
**Aradama:** \.\.\.\!  
**Kiyoka:** --HAAA\!  
**Kiyoka:** The readings from aradama in the area are gone\. It seems like that was the last one\.  
**Fuu:** Nice job-\. Toji sure are something else\. You had my eyes glued to the way you were handling that sword of yours\.  
**Kiyoka:** It's just really easy to coordinate with you, Fuu-san\. So, I sort of feel like I should be thanking you\.  
**Fuu:** You don't have to thank me or anything\. You're already doing a lot for us\. Ah, actually, mind if we stop by somewhere for a bit\?  
**Kiyoka:** Wow\.\.\. It's so pretty here\. I've never been to this park before\.  
**Kiyoka:** It's a good thing we stopped the aradama from running amok here\.  
**Fuu:** That's for sure-\. That's another thing you worked hard for, Kiyoka\.  
**Kiyoka:** That's not true\.\.\. It wasn't just because of me\.  
**Fuu:** You can't deny you're the one who defeated all those aradama today, can you\?  
**Kiyoka:** Somehow, I just felt a little less hesitant today with my swordsmanship\.  
**Fuu:** Fu fu fu, don't you get it\? That's the proof of your girl power\.  
**Kiyoka:** It is\!\?  
**Fuu:** Yep\. Now that your girl power's gone up, I'm sure you won't lose to any aradama\. Be confident in yourself, Kiyoka\.  
**Fuu:** A girl full of confidence is the strongest there is\.  
**Kiyoka:** Now that you mention it, attractive girls always seem to have a lot of confidence, don't they\.  
**Kiyoka:** Thank you for all you've done for me, Fuu-san\.  
**Fuu:** Hm\? What do you mean\?  
**Kiyoka:** You gave me all that encouragement to help me feel confident in myself\.  
**Fuu:** Ahaha-, you noticed, huh\?  
**Fuu:** (She caught my interest for some reason, so I might've gone overboard with getting in her business\.\)  
**Fuu:** Did I overdo it a little\?  
**Kiyoka:** Fufu, only when you made girl power sound so all powerful\. But, I was very glad for your help\.  
**Kiyoka:** I think I'll keep working towards bringing up my girl power from now on\!  
**Fuu:** Mmhm\. That's the spirit\. You can do it, Kiyoka\!
