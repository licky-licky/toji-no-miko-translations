## 1: For One's Conviction (1)
At that time, in Ichigaya--

  
**Maki:** It's been a while, Yomi.  
**Suzuka:** I'm glad to see you're fine.  
**Yomi:** ...So you did come after all.  
**Maki:** Come back with us. You don't need to do what President Takatsu tells you anymore.  
**Suzuka:** Yukari-sama is alive and well. Let's dedicate ourselves to her once more, as her elite guard.  
**Yomi:** ...Fufu.  
**Maki:** Yomi... Laughed?  
**Suzuka:** ...What's so funny?  
**Yomi:** Well, you and Shidou-san... You don't understand any of this.  
**Suzuka:** ...I take it, we don't need to restrain ourselves then.  
**Maki:** We will stop you, Yomi.  
**Yomi:** ............  

## 2: For One's Conviction (2)
**Yomi:** ............That should be enough.  
**Maki:** Wait, are you just going to leave, Yomi\!\!  
**Suzuka:** ...She's already gone.  
**Maki:** I know. I talked a big game, but in the end, I couldn't do anything to stop her.  
**Suzuka:** What are you despairing about? We'll have another chance. Or have you already given up on her?  
**Maki:** You're right; we can try again. Next time for sure.  
**Suzuka:** Good, that's the spirit.  
**Maki:** But still, I don't understand. Why would Yomi go that far for President Takatsu?  
**Suzuka:** I don't know the reason, but... In her eyes, I saw strong determination-- A form of conviction behind her actions.  
**Maki:** Conviction...  
**Suzuka:** But now isn't the time. I'm worried about Takirihime. Let's return to the Ministry of Defense.  

## 3: Two Princesses (1)
**Kanami:** Ayumu-chan...  
**Ayumu:** Come on, let's keep going\! Etou-san\!  
**Kaoru:** We're in a pinch, Hiyoyon. Do something.  
**Hiyori:** This isn't the time for your crap\!  
**Sayaka:** She's coming... Mai.  
**Ayumu:** Nn?  
**Hiyori:** Tagitsuhime...\!  
**Tagitsu:** Too long we've been apart. My other half.  
**Kanami:** Takirihime\!  
**Takiri:** .........  
**Tagistu:** This is your answer, then?  
**Takiri:** The potential of humans... I decided it would be unfortunate to lose.  
**Tagitsu:** How foolish.  
**Takiri:** .........  
**Tagitsu:** .........  
**Kanami:** Takirihime\!  
**Ayumu:** HAA-\!\!  
**Kanami:** Out of the way, Ayumu-chan\!  
**Ayumu:** We finally get to fight together though? I can finally match your sword, Etou-san\!  
**Ayumu:** So let's keep on fighting\!  

## 4: Two Princesses (2)
**Kanami:** Takirihime\!  
**Takiri:** .........  
**Tagitsu:** By our very nature, there is no difference in our strength. However, the humans need you unlike me...  
**Tagitsuhime:** And this is the result\!  
**Takiri:** Gagh...\!\!  
**Kanami:** Takirihime\!  
**Tagitsuhime:** Now, return to me\!  
**Kanami:** Takirihime...  
**Takiri:** Ahh... So that is how you look, Chidori girl...  
**Kanami:** Takirihime\!  
**Takiri:** I saw you... Flying freely...  
**Takiri:** Like the other name of that sword. You could even cut through lightning... Fly...  
**Takiri:** Humans... Fast... high... and... far...  
**Kanami:** Ahh... Takiri... hime...  
**Tagitsu:** That's better\!  
**Ellen:** She absorbed... Takirihime...  
**Sayaka:** No...  
**Kaoru:** Oi... What the hell do we do now...  
**Nene:** Ne...  
**Mai:** That means Tagitsuhime is even stronger...?  
**Hiyori:** Gh...\!  
**Tagitsu:** Hm...ã€€I could grow accustomed to this.  
**Tagitsu:** Ahahaha\!\!  
**Tagitsu:** With that settled, how to crush the gnats who would oppose me?  
**Tagitsu:** Know this... I have won\!  
**???:** Nahh\~\! Not yet\!  
**Hiyori:** That's...\!  
**Sayaka:** The fourth seat of the elite guard...  
**Kaoru:** Tsubakuro Yume\!  
**Yume:** ......Nihi\!  

## 5: Desire's Hold (1)
**Yui:** I'm so happy\~\! This is so fun\~\! Each and every one of you are just my type\!  
**Chie:** Yui-chan, Hana-chan, get a hold of yourselves\! We don't have any reason to fight each other\!  
**Hana:** What a weird thing to say. Of course we do.  
**Hana:** Tagitsuhime-sama is the one who will create our utopia. Anyone who would get in her way deserves only death.  
**Kiyoka:** Utopia...?  
**Hana:** It's no lie or false pretense-- A world without a shred of ugliness.  
**Kofuki:** And lemme guess, the catch is humans aren't allowed in that world either?  
**Hana:** Why do you have a problem with it? If that's what our princess decided, that makes it right.  
**Kofuki:** You're not even trying to talk sense.  
**Mihono:** Hey, seriously, what happened to you two?  
**Hana:** Nothing happened. I just couldn't take my life full of lies anymore.  
**Hana:** Living as a spy meant telling one lie to bury another. Under all that, who was I supposed to be\!\?  
**Hana:** Even though I didn't amount to anybody, the imperial guard accepted me. Even someone who was "just there" like me, the imperial guard accepted.  
**Yui:** Tagitsuhime-sama is our savior goddess. I feel sorry for all of you, not understanding how blessed it feels to fight for that goddess.  
**Mihono:** Savior...? Yui, she saved you from something?  
**Yui:** Mm... But, even if I told you about it, it wouldn't do any good.  
**Yui:** You're cute, Mihono-chan, but you can't save me. You can't do anything.  
**Mihono:** But...  
**Chie:** Is this what the noro did to you? It's clearly different from what they gave to the elite guard, though. This is just brainwashing.  
**Yui:** Shouldn't we get started already? If you go easy on us, you're going to die. So take this seriously. Okay, everyone?  
**Mihono:** ...Isn't there any other way?  
**Kofuki:** They're more than happy to fight. This is all we can do\!  
**Mirja:** This is my fault... Because of me...  
**Chie:** Mirja-san, hang in there\! Here they come\!  

## 6: Desire's Hold (2)
**Kiyoka:** Pant, pant... Th-They're strong...  
**Hana:** We've still got strength to spare, but this is all it takes to make you give in?  
**Yui:** Maybe we got a little too strong?  
**Chie:** Open your eyes, you two\! Can't you see how wrong this is?  
**Hana:** I told you, our eyes are open. And there's not a single thing wrong about it.  
**Mirja:** It's all, my fault... My miscalculation... Led to this...  
**Yui:** You've got it all wrong, Mirja-san. It's thanks to you that I got into the imperial guard. I really should be thanking you\!  
**Mirja:** Kh...  
**Kofuki:** Don't start the pity party now\! You can say sorry till it kills you later\! But right now, keep your eyes on the enemy\!  
**Yui:** Al\~right, I think it's time for round 2--  
**Hana:** Wait, Yui. They gave the order to retreat.  
**Yui:** Ehh\~, but things are finally heating up over here? How am I supposed to turn down something this delicious\~\!  
**Hana:** One last thing, Mirja-senpai. Some advice for you.  
**Hana:** As an Ayanokouji toji, you should join the imperial guard. You'll find salvation there.  
**Yui:** Yeah yeah, I know you'd make a fan\~tastic member of the imperial guard, Mirja-san. Anyway, till next time\!  
**Mihono:** Wait, you two\!\!  
**Mirja:** Why did it turn out like this...  

## 7: Secret Weapon (1)
**Yume:** YAAA-------\!  
**Tagitsu:** Tsubakuro Yume. You should be dead...  
**Yume:** Hehe, I am not that weak\!  
**Ayumu:** Protect Tagitsuhime-sama\! Drive the enemy away, quickly\!  
**Yume:** I'm not here for you losers.  
**Imperial Guard:** She might be from the old elite guard, but we can take her if we surround her\! All members, move in\!  
**Yume:** Kyahahaha\! You can be my warmup then\!  
**Ellen:** We can't let Yumecchi fight by herself either\! Let's go-\!  
**Kaoru:** I mean, won't she be fine on her own?  
**Ellen:** We\! Are\! Going\! To\! Help\!  
**Kaoru:** If you say so...  

## 8: Secret Weapon (2)
**Imperial Guard:** GYAAAA-\!\!  
**Yume:** This imperial guard of yours is a joke, you know?  
**Hiyori:** What's with that insane strength...  
**Tagitsu:** Interesting. Well done, for one half dead.  
**Yume:** I wasn't even trying though. I can't show my good side against something like that.  
**Tagitsuhime:** Enough babbling, little girl. No matter how strong, you're still human. No match for me.  
**Yume:** Then, I'll show you me at my best, Onee-san.  
**Yume:** Gegh\!\! Cough cough, cough... Urghh...  
**Sayaka:** Blood...? I didn't see her get cut.  
**Kanami:** I know. Tsubakuro-san didn't get cut. That's from...  
**Yume:** Cough cough... Why now...\!\!  
**Tagitsu:** Far from the best of shape, aren't you.  
**Tagitsu:** Mm... Having achieved my purpose of absorbing Takirihime, I have no reason to remain here.  
**Yume:** Don't... Go... Cough cough...\!\!  
**Tagitsu:** Farewell, half dead.  
**Yume:** Just when... I got to... Show everyone... How great I am... Cough cough cough...\!\!  
**Maki:** Yume\!  
**Yume:** Maki-onee-san... Suzuka-onee-san... If I just had a little longer... She got away...  
**Suzuka:** You did what you could. Rather, I'm impressed how well you did with your body in that state...  
**Maki:** ...Yume. Even if it's hard, you have to be ready for action soon. Just rest for now.  
**Suzuka:** Listen to her. We need you, Yume.  
**Yume:** Ehehe, "you need me"...? That sounds, nice... Say that again later, Suzuka-onee-san...  
**Maki:** Yanase, can I leave handling the aftermath here to you?  
**Mai:** Y-You can count on me\!  
**Suzuka:** In that case, everyone, I'm sorry, but we need to leave.  
**Ellen:** Yumecchi was amazing back there. She beat most of those noro powered toji all by herself.  
**Kaoru:** Yeah... I bet only someone like Kanami could top that.  
**Other:** Scheme in Motion  
**Yukina:** Princess... I'm told everything is ready for you.  
**Tagitsu:** I see... However, I have no interest in it.  
**Yukina:** But, Princess...\! Isn't this the perfect opportunity to show the world your beautiful figure\!  
**Yukina:** Do you know how hard I've worked to make today possible? Please, spare me some patience...  
**Tagitsu:** Hm. Then... Out of respect for your efforts.  
**Yukina:** Ahh, I'm glad to hear it...  
**Tagitsu:** Now, to make my appearance.  
**Yukina:** Of course, Princess\!
