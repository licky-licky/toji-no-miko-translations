Happy New Year! The Tojis' New Year's an...
===========================================

## 1: An Invitation to a New Year's Shrine Visit
In the middle of January.

  
**Yukina:** Why can't I be with Yukari-onee-sama\!?  
**Sana:** Sigh.  
**Yukina:** Don't sigh at me\!  
**Yukina:** January's already halfway over, you know? And still, I can count the number of hours I've spent together with Yukari-sama on just one hand\!\!  
**Sana:** But I mean like, there's nothing you can do about that, right?  
**Sana:** Missions and stuff get really busy around New Year's, and Yukari-senpai's probably got a lot going on at home.  
**Yukina:** Still, Hiiragi-san gets to be together with Yukari-onee-sama, doesn't she\!? That's not fair\!  
**Sana:** Isn't that just like something you've gotta deal with?  
**Yukina:** ......  
**Yukina:** Why would you say that? Whose side are you on, Sana?  
**Sana:** (...I'm not really on anybody's side here. I mean, like, whatever I say, I can tell this'll get really annoying.)  
**Sana:** Anyway, let's forget about all that, Yukina-senpai.  
**Yukina:** Forget about that?  
**Sana:** Yeah. I mean, I don't really have to tell you whose side I'm on, right?  
**Sana:** So like, forgetting about that... Want to do our first shrine visit or something?  
**Yukina:** Would you like to go on our first shrine visit, Yukari-onee-sama\!  
**Yukari:** Our first shrine visit... Right now?  
**Yukina:** Yes\!  
**Yukina:** You've been so busy for so long, so I thought you could also use a break... What do you say?  
**Yukari:** Sure, a break's nice sometimes.  
**Yukina:** Great\!  
**Yukari:** That'll be fine, right, Kagari?  
**Kagari:** Yes, Yukari-sama.  
**Yukina:** (Hiiragi-san\!)  
**Yukina:** (Now's your only chance to stay next to Yukari-onee-sama like that\! On our shrine visit, I'll be with Yukari-onee-sama...\!  You can just go be with Sana\!)  
**Minato:** Yukari, Kagari... Wait, Yukina and Sana? Huh; what're you doing here?  
**Kagari:** Sagami-san was just here inviting us to make our first shrine visit.  
**Minato:** Cool, our first shrine visit\! I'll go with\!  
**Yukina:** (You're bringing Minato-senpai too\!? Hiiragi-san\! Is that how badly you want to ruin my time with Yukari-onee-sama\!?)  
**Sana:** (That look on her face... She's totally getting mad at Kagari-senpai for no reason.)  
**Minato:** C'mon everybody, let's go\!  

## 2: Let's Draw Our Fortunes
**Yukari:** It figures it wouldn't be very crowded this long after New Year's. The food stalls too... I guess there won't be any.  
**Kagari:** Yes; it makes it easier to stay alert of our surroundings.  
**Yukina:** (Hiiragi-san, you're sticking right up next to Yukari-onee-sama\! You really are trying to get in my way, aren't you\!)  
**Yukina:** (But, this is where Sana comes in...)  
**Minato:** Huh, so you're the one who thought of all coming to a shrine together?  
**Sana:** Yep, that was me-.  
**Yukina:** (Why are you off having fun chatting with Minato-senpai\!? Didn't you promise to come along and help me\!?)  
**Minato:** Since we came to make our first shrine visit, let's all draw our fortunes\!  
**Sana:** Sounds good\!  
**Minato:** And whoever gets the worst fortune is buying us juice, Sana.  
**Sana:** Ehh\!?  
**Kagari:** Gambling on your fortunes is so unscrupulous.  
**Yukari:** But it does sound fun.  
**Kagari:** You're bringing Yukari-sama into this too... Minato-senpai?  
**Minato:** Huh? You're mad at me?  
**Sana:** What're you waiting for, Yukina-senpai? You're gonna get left behind?\!  
**Yukina:** Geez\! Why did things end up like this\!\!  
**Minato:** Nice; a "great fortune"\! What'd you get, Sana?  
**Sana:** You got me beat\~. Mine's just "medium fortune".  
**Yukari:** Oh. Then, mine's the worst. See.  
**Minato:** Yukari's is a plain old "fortune"\! What should I make you buy for me...  
**Sana:** Thanks for paying\!  
**Yukina:** Yukari-onee-sama won't be buying you anything\! Mine's "fortune to come"\!  
**Kagari:** Honestly... What are you all even doing.  
**Minato:** Well, what'd you get, Kagari?  
**Kagari:** ..."Great fortune".  
**Minato:** Ahaha, we're the same\!  
**Kagari:** ...  
**Yukari:** You shouldn't look so upset, getting a great fortune, Kagari... [achoo].  
**Yukari:** It's gotten a little chilly, hasn't it?  
**Yukina:** Yukari-onee-sama\!? It'd be awful if you caught a cold\! I'll go buy you something warm to drink\!  
**Sana:** ...I'll go too. Yukina-senpai on her own probably won't get anything for anybody besides Yukari-senpai.  
**Minato:** Then, I guess I'll go along. Won't you have a hard time carrying drinks for 4 people by yourself?  
**Sana:** Thanks\!  
**Yukari:** It's just the two of us now.  
**Kagari:** ...Right.  

## 3: The Two of Them
**Kagari:** It's finally quieted down.  
**Kagari:** We only came here to pay the shrine a visit, so we should do it without making such a commotion.  
**Yukari:** ...  
**Kagari:** What are you smiling for, Yukari-sama? Was there something strange about what I said?  
**Yukari:** It's not like that.  
**Yukari:** I was just thinking, even though you're complaining, you look like you're enjoying this.  
**Kagari:** That's not......  
**Kagari:** ...  
**Yukari:** Is there any reason you couldn't let yourself seem more happy about it?  
**Kagari:** That's... I've come to accept that a little, about myself.  
**Kagari:** ...I'm letting myself be too relaxed.  
**Yukari:** Huh?  
**Kagari:** I've been getting too close to Minato-senpai and the others. I'll maintain a proper distance.  
**Yukari:** Kagari...  
**Kagari:** There won't be any issues. When the time comes... I'll make sure to fulfill my duty.  
**Yukari:** That's not it, Kagari. I'm not worried about that at all.  
**Yukari:** If anything... I'm grateful toward Minato.  
**Kagari:** ...  
**Yukari:** Hey, Kagari. I just...  
**Minato:** We got drinks\!  
**Kagari/Yukari:** --\!?  
**Yukina:** Yukari-onee-sama\! Here's hot tea for you\!  
**Sana:** And I got the same for you, Kagari-senpai.  
**Kagari:** ...Thank you, Sana. I'll take it.  
**Yukari:** (Hey, Kagari. I just...)  
**Yukari:** (Wish days like today could go on for as long as possible.)  
**Yukina:** Yukari-onee-sama? Aren't you going to drink it?  
**Yukari:** Sure. Thank you, Yukina.  
**Yukina:** No problem\!\!
