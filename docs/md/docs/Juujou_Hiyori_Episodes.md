## 1: Melting Smile
**Kanami:** Oh, there's an ice cream shop over there\. I could really go for some ice cream\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.If you're dying to eat it, I don't mind joining you\.  
**Kanami:** Mm\.\.\. I don't think I'll die, so let's just pass\.  
**Hiyori:** Eh\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** Ahaha, just kidding\! Let's go\!  
**Kanami:** By the way, do you like any flavors besides chocomint, Hiyori-chan\?  
**Hiyori:** I've never thought about it\.  
**Kanami:** Then, wanna taste some of what I'm ordering\?  
**Kanami:** Excuse me\! I'll have a triple scoop with strawberry, cheesecake, and cream soda flavor\!  
**Hiyori:** I'll have a triple as well\. Make all three chocolate mint\.  
**Kanami:** You always take it to the extremes\.\.\. Here, Hiyori-chan\. Try this\.  
**Hiyori:** Mm\.\.\. This cream soda flavor is actually good\.  
**Hiyori:** Can I have some of the strawberry and cheesecake too\?  
**Kanami:** Go ahead\.  
**Hiyori:** This one, it's good too\. Mixing cheesecake and ice cream sounded like heresy, but this is actually a real winner\.  
**Kanami:** I know, right\?  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.By the way, Kanami\. Why are you aiming your phone at me\?  
**Kanami:** Welll, you just looked so cute eating ice cream that I wanted to take a video of it\.  
**Hiyori:** --Huh\!\?  
**Kanami:** When you smile like that, it looks like your face is melting\. And now, that smile's all mine\~\.  
**Hiyori:** ---\!\? Stop messing around\!\! Delete that right now\!\!  
**Kanami:** Ehehe, no way\~\. I bet if I uploaded it to a video site, I'd get tons of likes too\!  
**Hiyori:** Don't do that\!\!  
**Kanami:** For the title, how about\.\.\. \"Black Haired Beauty Caught on Hidden Camera Eating Ice Cream\"\?  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.Fine\. If that's how you're going to be, I'll eat all of your ice cream\!  
**Kanami:** Ahhh\! My ice cream\! I was just kidding, Hiyori-chan\!\!  

## 2: Reading Time
**Kiyoka:** Oh no\.\.\. I was re-reading my favorite book, but I can't remember where I left it\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** The only place I haven't looked yet\.\.\. Is this classroom\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** Ah, someone's in there\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** (If I remember right, that's the third year, Juujou-senpai\.\.\.\? She always seems so hard to approach\.\.\. I wonder what she's reading\.\.\.\)  
**Kiyoka:** (Ahh\! That's my book\! Why is Juujou-senpai reading it though\.\.\. Wh-What should I do\.\.\.\)  
**Kiyoka:** (Actually, I want to know what she thinks of it\.\.\. But it's no ordinary love story, so I'd be embarrassed if she kept reading\.\.\.\)  
**Kiyoka:** (Two teenage girls share such a lovely bond, but they have to fight against the destiny their parents left them, and things start heating up\.\.\. I really recommend it\.\.\.\!\)  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** (S-So what does she think of it\.\.\. I love that book so much, but\.\.\. Ahh, if only I had a little more confidence\.\.\.\)  
**Kiyoka:** (\? Huh\.\.\.\?\)  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.\.\.\.sniffle\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** (S-She's crying\.\.\.\! Juujou-senpai is crying\.\.\.\!\?\)  
**Hiyori:** \! Who's there\?  
**Kiyoka:** Hya\! S-S-S-S-Sorry\! I didn't mean to spy on you\.\.\.\!  
**Kiyoka:** I just came to get back the book I left behind\.\.\.\!  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.This is your book\? Sorry for reading it\.  
**Kiyoka:** D-Don't worry about it\! Do you like reading\?  
**Hiyori:** I don't normally read many books, but\.\.\. This was interesting\. I suddenly found myself getting sucked into it\.  
**Kiyoka:** Th-Then, I'll\.\.\. I'll lend it to you\! Please read it to the end\!  
**Hiyori:** No, I couldn't\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** I don't know any other girls who've read that book\! I want to talk about it with someone\! So please, read it\!  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** Ah, sorry\.\.\.\! I'm imposing on you too much, aren't I\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** If you insist, then I'll borrow it\.  
**Kiyoka:** \! Th-Thank you so much\!  
**Hiyori:** What's your name\?  
**Kiyoka:** I'm Musumi, in my second year\. And you're Juujou-senpai, aren't you\? You're participating in the upcoming tournament\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.Right\. I'll be sure to give this back to you before then\.  
**Kiyoka:** No, you don't have to rush yourself\.  
**Hiyori:** I'm in a hurry\.  
**Kiyoka:** \.\.\.\?  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.After the tournament's over, I'd like it if you could recommend some books for me\.  
**Kiyoka:** S-Sure\! I'd love to\!  

## 3: Hiyori's Long Held Desire
**Bodyguard Toji:** There they are\! The ones who attacked the head of the family\! Just make this easy and surrender\!  
**Hiyori:** Tch\. They caught up to us\.  
**Kanami:** But if we just beat these guards, we should be able to get away\!  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.Do you really plan on fighting beside me\? You'll make yourself an enemy of everyone\.  
**Kanami:** I made up my mind to run away with you\!  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.Then I hope you don't regret this\.  
**Kanami:** \.\.\.Phew\. Since we've made it this far, we should be safe for a while\.  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** Hm\? What's wrong, Hiyori-chan\? You keep staring at me\.  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.No, it's nothing\.  
**Kanami:** Okay\.  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.Why aren't you asking me any questions\?  
**Kanami:** \.\.\.I can tell there's a strong determination behind your sword\. A desire that won't let up until you reach your goal\.  
**Kanami:** No matter what your reason is, I've made up my mind to help you\. You can share the rest with me when you feel ready\.  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.Oh\.  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.Then I'll tell you why\.\.\. The reason why I'm after Origami Yukari\.  
**Kanami:** Okay\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** You know about the great aradama incident, \"The Great Disaster of Sagami Bay\", that happened 20 years ago, don't you\?  
**Kanami:** They said it's the worst aradama incident in history\. Origami Yukari-sama led a special force of the current presidents of the Five Traditions into Enoshima to suppress it\.  
**Hiyori:** That's right\.  
**Hiyori:** But to say they suppressed it was a lie\. Origami Yukari, who they called a hero\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** Is nothing more than the great aradama they claimed to have destroyed\.  
**Hiyori:** The disaster that threatened the world\. That despicable being\. An utter stain on humanity\. That's what she is\.  
**Kanami:** Huh\.\.\.\!\?  
**Hiyori:** My mother was one of the toji there at Enoshima\. She should have had the power to destroy it, but she failed\.  
**Hiyori:** Now that aradama lives on, pretending to be Origami Yukari\.  
**Hiyori:** My mother's power as a toji faded, and I watched her waste away over the years\. And, last year, as I stayed by her side, she passed on\.  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.The night my mother died, I swore I would finish the duty she left undone\.  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.Well\? It's a heavy burden, isn't it\?  
**Hiyori:** Half of it is my responsibility as a toji\.\.\. But half of it is my own revenge\. That's why, there's no need for you to join me\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** You're right\.  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.\?  
**Kanami:** I think it's too heavy for you\.  
**Kanami:** That's why, I'll help you carry some of it\.  
**Hiyori:** Kanami\.\.\.  

## 4: Juujou Hiyori's Chest Investigation
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** I wonder what's wrong with Hiyori-chan\. She's been looking upset for a while now\.\.\.  
**Sayaka:** \.\.\.\?  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.\.\.\. \"Eternally flat chested woman\"\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** No matter how I think about it, it seems like it has to be an insult\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** But I'd never thought of there being some kind of value related to chest size before\. Is it really that bad mine are this small\.\.\.\?  
**Hiyori:** In the first place, Kaoru herself is older than me, but she doesn't seem any better\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** Considering that, I don't think my flatness is too strange\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.\.\.\. \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\!\?  
**Hiyori:** Ellen must be some kind of special case\.\.\. The difference in size is too disturbing\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.That's actually somewhat relieving\. There's no way she can be considered the standard\.  
**Hiyori:** No\.\.\. Wait, that reminds me\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** I hadn't considered her until now, but Mai and Ellen together make a convincing argument\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** And Mai is even younger than I am\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** Is that it\? Does this mean my chest should have been at least that size by now\.\.\.\!\?  
**Hiyori:** And\.\.\. What rule defines how large they are to begin with\.\.\.\!\?  
**Hiyori:** What do Kaoru and I lack\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** What do Ellen and Mai have\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.\.\.\.Cheerfulness\.\.\.\? Kindness\.\.\.\?  
**Hiyori:** Is their size a symbol representing the depths of a person's generosity\.\.\.\!\?  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** \! Kanami\! That's right, I still have Kanami\!  
**Hiyori:** She's fairly cheery and considerate\. Much more than Kaoru and I at least; more on Mai and Ellen's level\!  
**Hiyori:** But her chest\.\.\.\!  
**Hiyori:** It seems like there's no relationship between chest size and human nature after all\. Fufu\.\.\. It's simply individual differences\.  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.\.\.\.What's wrong with her\?  
**Ellen:** She's been staring hard at everyone's boobs\. But her face suddenly lit up when she settled on Kanamin's\!  
**Ellen:** Hiyoyon really loves Kanamin, after all\!  
**Kaoru:** Boobs\? \.\.\.Hehee\. So that's what this is about\.  
**Kaoru:** Kukuku\.\.\. You really are fun to mess with\.  

## 5: Hiyori's Study Session
*Kanami keeps leaning over into Hiyori*

  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Mai:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** Hmhmm\~\~\~\~\.  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.What\? We aren't in the same grade\. Watching me isn't going to help you on your test\.  
**Kanami:** No, it's just, your notes look so pretty, Hiyori-chan\. I already knew about Mai-chan, but I didn't think you were so good at studying too\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** You're both such strong toji, so don't you think it's unfair you get good grades too\?  
**Hiyori:** Shut up\. I bet you only think about swordfighting in the middle of lectures\. You should pay more attention\.  
**Kanami:** Wait, how'd you know\? Did you peek in one day\!\?  
**Hiyori:** Sigh\.\.\. We're getting sidetracked, so just forget it\.  
**Hiyori:** In the time we've wasted now, you could have finished at least one page\. Work on catching up\.  
**Kanami:** Fiiine\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** \.\.\.\.\.\. (Peek\)\.  
**Kanami:** It's such a nice day outside too\.\.\. Hey, Hiyori-chan, after this is over, want to have a practice bat-  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.Are you actually bored already\? It hasn't even been a full minute\.  
**Kanami:** S-Sorry\.\.\. I'll study\.  
**Kanami:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\! \.\.\.\.\.\.\~\!  
**Hiyori:** (She's finally quieted down\. I started doubting her ability to concentrate, but it looks like she's resigned to take this seriously\.\.\.\)  
**Hiyori:** Hey, what are you doodling in your textbook for\!\?  
**Kanami:** Because, I feel like I could come up with a better method than the one they're teaching in here\.  
**Kanami:** See, look\~ With the stance they're teaching, you lose awareness around here\~ But\.\.\. How about this\!  
**Hiyori:** The tactics in there have been tested countless times through history\. You won't just come up with something better like that\.\.\.  
*Hiyori leans over*

  
**Hiyori:** Hm\? Actually\.\.\. This might work too\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** Right\!\?  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.No, it wouldn't\. See, in this situation, your opponent could then\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** Whoops, you're right\.\.\. Ah, what about\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** Rather than that, you could\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.\.\.\.Ah\!  
**Hiyori:** Hey\! Now you're getting me distracted too\!\!  
**Kanami:** Calm down, Hiyori-chan\. Even if you slack off here, you'll still get good grades\.	  
**Hiyori:** What's with that condescending attitude\!\? In the first place, you're the one who asked me to help you study for your test\!  
**Mai (who was here the whole time\):** Fufu\.\.\. You're actually pretty good at taking care of people, aren't you, Hiyori-chan\?  
*Hiyori leans over to Mai*

  
**Hiyori:** Hey, Mai\! Isn't she your responsibility\!\? Don't laugh like it's my problem; help me out with her\!  
**Mai:** Hmmm, I don't know about that\? Lately, it feels more and more like you're the one on Kanami-chan duty\.\.\.  
**Mai:** And I'm busy with my own studying too\. Take good care of Kanami-chan for me, Hiyori-chan\~\.  
**Hiyori:** M-Mai\.\.\.\? That smile of yours looks strangely forced\.\.\. Are you mad about something\.\.\.\?  
**Mai:** I'm not mad\. Maybe just a little jealous\.  
**Hiyori:** Huh\.\.\.\!\?  
*Kanami jumps up*

  
**Kanami:** Hey, Hiyori-chan\! I just thought of a really good idea\! Can we do a practice round to test it out\?  
**Hiyori:** You just get back to work\!

## [Stage Girl: Start\]: We'll Starlight\!
**Hiyori:** HAAA\!  
**Aradama:** GYAAAA\!  
**Karen:** (stare\)\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** Phew\.\.\. Nn\? What is it, Karen\? Did you want something from me\?  
**Karen:** Don't worry\! I don't need anything, so just keep going like that\!  
**Hiyori:** You say that, but it's awkward with you watching me so closely\.\.\.  
**Karen:** Ah, that makes sense\! Then I'll just say what I'm thinking\!  
**Karen:** Your swordsmanship is so pretty, Hiyori-chan\!  
**Hiyori:** Wh-What\!\?  
**Karen:** Your movements never waver, and the way you swing your sword, it feels so dignified\!  
**Karen:** How did you learn to swing your sword so pretty\?  
**Hiyori:** How\? All I can say is, I was dedicated to my training\.\.\.  
**Karen:** Then it really is all about practice, huh\. I was hoping you'd say there's some trick to it\.  
**Karen:** Are there any, Hiyori-chan\!\?  
**Hiyori:** Uh\.\.\. Y-Your face is too close\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** Kh\.\.\. In that case, why don't I let you experience it firsthand\?  
**Karen:** Firsthand\?  
**Hiyori:** Fight with me\.  
**Hiyori:** It'd be easier to understand that way than me trying to explain it to you\.  
**Karen:** On a stage overflowing with stardust, a flower of love blooms gracefully\. Clad in a new me, I jump onto the shining stage\!  
**Karen:** 99th generation, Aijou Karen\! We will all Starlight\!  
**Hiyori:** How will we decide who wins\?  
**Karen:** Whoever's cloak falls off is the loser\.  
**Hiyori:** Got it, simple enough\.  
**Karen:** Right\! \.\.\.Are you ready\?  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.Yes, anytime\.  
**Karen:** Okay\! Then, I'll give it all I've got\!  
**Hiyori:** I'm not about to go easy on you either\!  
**Karen:** That would be a non non\!  
**Karen:** With that settled\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** Let's begin\!  

## [Stage Girl: End\]: Don't Forget, Okay\?
**Hiyori:** A staircase\.\.\.\? The stage really does build up on its own\.  
**Karen:** I'm not really sure how it works though\! YAAAAAA\!\!  
**Hiyori:** Hmph\! Don't think you'll find an opening that easy\!  
**Karen:** Whoa, you avoided that so easy\!\? Ahh, guess that won't work either\.  
**Hiyori:** Still\.\.\. What's going on with this place\? This strange stage we're on\.  
**Karen:** What kind of stage do you want it to be, Hiyori-chan\? If you think about it, I think it'll change\.  
**Hiyori:** For me\? It's okay for me to change it too\?  
**Karen:** Why wouldn't it be okay\?  
**Hiyori:** Hmm\.\.\.  
**Karen:** \.\.\.Now's my chance\! You're wide open\!  
**Hiyori:** No I was not\! \.\.\.Still, I might as well try this out now\.  
**Karen:** Chocolate mint\!\?  
**Hiyori:** I don't believe it\.\.\. It actually appeared\.  
**Karen:** You like chocolate mint, Hiyori-chan\? That's good for when you have to brush your teeth, huh\!  
**Hiyori:** I don't need it for that\!  
**Karen:** Wah\!\? Wawawa\!\!  
**Hiyori:** Stop dodging\! Didn't you want to experience my swordsmanship\!\?  
**Karen:** Easy for you to say, but\.\.\. Wawa\!\? I-I've gotta strike back\.\.\. YAH\!  
**Hiyori:** Too slow\!  
**Karen:** Uwah\!\?  
**Karen:** I seriously can't hit you at all\!  
**Hiyori:** Why do you look happy about that\?  
**Karen:** Cause I get to see your pretty swordfighting up close\! I'm learning a whole lot\!  
**Hiyori:** It's about time you showed what you're learning then\.  
**Karen:** You're right\.\.\. How about this\!  
**Karen:** HAAAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Hiyori:** -\!\? That movement, that's from when I\.\.\.\!  
**Karen:** Nice\! I made you block me with your okatana\!  
**Hiyori:** Right, that attack wasn't too bad just now\.  
**Karen:** Stage girls are evolving every day\!  Let's do some more, Hiyori-chan\!  
**Karen:** Thank you for fighting with me, Hiyori-chan\! It was a whole lot of fun\!  
**Hiyori:** I normally have to keep someone far more persistent company, after all\. I'm fine with being your opponent whenever you want\.  
**Hiyori:** And also, make sure not to forget the way you moved before, alright\?  
**Karen:** Okay\! I'll never forget it, Hiyori-chan\!

## [Ceremonial Dress - Misogi: Start\]: Isolation
**Hiyori:** (When did this start, I wonder\? When I became conscious of my loneliness\.\)  
**Hiyori:** (At the very least, I didn't used to be like this\. Because, back then, all I could ever think of was getting stronger\.\)  
**Hiyori:** To take the duty my mother left behind into my own hands\.\.\.  
**Himeno Shiho:** Ah, heyyy\! Juujou-saaan\! Wait up-\!  
**Hiyori:** Nn\? You're\.\.\.  
**Shiho:** Himeno Shiho; we're in the same grade\. Let's get along\.  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.Right\.  
**Shiho:** So hey, you're strong aren't you, Juujou-san\? You really surprised me\.  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.I guess\. Did you want something\?  
**Shiho:** Ah, that's right\.  
**Shiho:** My skills with a sword are still nowhere near that good\. So, if it's alright with you, I was wondering if you could teach me some things later\?  
**Shiho:** I mean, just if you have some free time\.  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.Sorry, but there's something I have to do\.  
**Shiho:** Oh, okay\.\.\. Hmm, that's too bad\.  
**Shiho:** Hey, there's Chinami\! Heyyy, want to do some practice together now-\?  
**Kamo Chinami:** Mm, okay\! Now's perfect; I was just thinking of practicing not getting my hair and clothes so disheveled while I'm fighting\.  
**Shiho:** Cool\! Then, I'll talk to you later, Juujou-san\!  
**Hiyori:** Practicing together, huh\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.Well, I should get going now\.  
**Hiyori:** HMPH, HAA, YAAA, HAA\!  
**Hiyori:** (The only thing I thought about then was growing stronger\.\)  
**Hiyori:** HAAAA, HAA\! SEI, YAA, HAA, HAAA, YAA\!  
**Hiyori:** (I distanced myself from others as best as I could, and lived only to polish my own skills\.\)  
**Hiyori:** I have to be faster, sharper, stronger\.\.\.\!  
**Hiyori:** (I had to be the one to carry out what my mother failed to finish\. And so I was always alone\. Still, I never once felt lonely\.\)  
**Hiyori:** HAAAAAAA, HAA\!\!  
**Hiyori:** Pant\.\.\. Pant\.\.\. Pant\.\.\. Kh, is that all it takes for me to lose my breath\.\.\.\!  
**Hiyori:** I can keep going\.\.\.\! I'm not done here yet\.\.\.\!  
**Hiyori:** (That's right\.\.\. Until I met Kanami and the others, and began spending time with them\.\.\.\)  

## [Ceremonial Dress - Misogi: End\]: Growth
**Hiyori:** (It was after I met Kanami and the others that, before I knew it, it had become unusual for me to be alone\.\)  
**Hiyori:** (So is that the reason\? Why, when I'm by myself, I started feeling my loneliness\.\)  
**Hiyori:** (After feeling that, I wanted to ask myself\.\)  
**Hiyori:** (Have I gotten weaker than I used to be\.\.\.\?\)  
**Aradama:** KWAAAAAAA-\!\!\!  
**Hiyori:** Urgh\.\.\.\!  
**Hiyori:** Pant, pant\.\.\. Damnit\.\.\. Is this how it ends up as soon as I want some time to think on my own\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** Still\.\.\. I didn't expect this swarm of aradama to show up here\.\.\.  
**Aradama:** GRRRRUUU\.\.\.\!  
**Hiyori:** (Here they come\.\.\.\!\)  
**\?\?\?:** No you don't-\! YAAAA\!  
**Aradama:** GAAA,aaaa\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** Are you okay, Hiyori-chan\!\?  
**Hiyori:** K-Kanami\.\.\.\?  
**Mai:** And she's not the only one who came to help\.  
**Hiyori:** Mai, and the rest of you too\.\.\.\?  
**Ellen:** You should be thanking Nene, Hiyoyon\. Nene was the one who noticed the aradama and led us here\!  
**Nene:** Nene-\!  
**Kanami:** Look, everybody\! That one there should be the boss aradama\!  
**Aradama:** GGGGAAAAAAAAA-\!\!  
**Sayaka:** Mai, give us orders\.  
**Mai:** Right, okay\. Everyone, deal with the nearby aradama\. Kanami-chan, do you think you can hold off the boss for a while\? While you do that, I'll take Hiyori-chan to safety\.  
**Kanami:** Sure, I'm on it, Mai-chan\! YAAAAAAA\!  
**Ellen:** We should go too, Kaoru\!  
**Kaoru:** Not like we have a say in it\.  
**Mai:** Alright, you come with me, Hiyori-chan\.  
**Hiyori:** (But, I can't just leave everyone else behind\.\.\.\!\)  
**Hiyori:** Mai, I'm going to stand and fight too\.  
**Mai:** Eh\? But, you're hurt\.\.\.\?  
**Hiyori:** This is nothing\. Besides, we can't leave Kanami to fight that boss aradama by herself\.  
**Hiyori:** Let's go, Mai\. We'll all sweep through the aradama at once\. HAAAAAA\!  
**Hiyori:** (In a sense, maybe I have gotten weaker\. Since I met Kanami, I came to realize my own loneliness; how weak I am on my own\.\)  
**Hiyori:** (Even so, being able to fight side by side with others like I am now, I'm sure I can accomplish things I couldn't before\.\)  
**Hiyori:** (In that case, this strength is enough\.\)  
**Hiyori:** (With this, I won't regret these days I spend with Kanami and the rest\. No matter what may come, I won't regret it\.\)

## [Yuusha 2: Hiyori: Start\]: Toji and Heroes-- The Stoic Pair
**Sonoko:** We'll see you off from here\~\.  
**Kanami:** Hiyori-chan, I know your aradama mission with Karin-chan will be a bit of a long trip, but do what you can\.  
**Hiyori:** Sure, you don't have to worry\.  
**Kanami:** I wanted to come along, to see more of Karin-chan's dual wielding, but it was too much when I have a mission of my own\. That's a little disappointing\.  
**Hiyori:** As always\.\.\. You act the same towards everyone when swordfighting is involved\. Well, that's how you are\.  
**Kanami:** I mean, she can dual wield, can't she\? Yukari-sama and Shichinosato-san can do it too, but it's not something you get to see all that often, is it\?  
**Sonoko:** Nibosshi, you get along with her without fighting, okay-\? Also, here's 500 yen for snacks\.  
**Karin:** Am I going on a field trip\!\? What if they think us Heroes can't take things seriously\!  
**Sonoko:** For your snacks-- Don't you think it would be best to re-energize with some sugar when you get a break\? And also, Niboshi don't count as snacks, so don't worry about that\~\.  
**Karin:** Of course they don't\. Niboshi form a complete diet\.  
**Hiyori:** (\.\.\.Niboshi\? Niboshi, huh\.\)  
**Hiyori:** Anyway, we should leave\.  
**Karin:** That's right, we won't get anything done waiting around here talking\.  
**Kanami/Sonoko:** Have a safe trip-\!  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Karin:** \.\.\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** (At times like these, the sensible thing to do would be to find something to talk about, wouldn't it\?\)  
**Hiyori:** (In that case\.\.\. Alright\.\)  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.Hey\.  
**Karin:** \.\.\.Hey\.  
**Hiyori:** Ah, oh\. You can go ahead, Karin\.  
**Karin:** I wasn't going to say anything important\. You can say what you were going to first\.  
**Hiyori:** Alright\.\.\.\. Well, let's work together today\. I've seen the way you fight, so I don't think we'll have anything to worry about\.  
**Karin:** I made up my mind to help out, and I'll see it through\. You can rely on me\.  
**Karin:** It'll depend on how many aradama there are, but what if I soften them up, and you finish them off\? That should be the most efficient course of action\.  
**Hiyori:** That should be fine\. I was thinking of following the same plan once we got to the site\.  
**Karin:** That's good then\.  
**Hiyori:** What were you about to say before\?  
**Karin:** Would it be difficult to completely and fully eliminate all the aradama\?  
**Karin:** There are people living in the town\. And aradama appear there\.\.\. No matter how you look at it, they're living right next door to danger\.  
**Hiyori:** If we could do that, that would be for the best\. Though, unfortunately, we still haven't found an effective way of doing that\.  
**Karin:** \.\.\.So if it were possible, you would have surely done it long ago\. Sorry for asking something strange\.  
**Hiyori:** No, I don't mind\.  
**Hiyori:** You're a\.\.\. You're a kind person, Karin\. Without a second thought, you're worried for the people in our world too\. Though, everyone in the Hero Club seems that way\.  
**Karin:** I-Isn't that just normal\.\.\.\? That kind of attitude\. All of you too, if you came to our world and had the strength to fight our enemies, you'd do it, wouldn't you\?  
**Hiyori:** That's true\. I'd hope so\.  

## [Yuusha 2: Hiyori: End\]: Niboshi and Chocolate Mint
**Karin:** TORYAAA-\! --HAAH\!  
**Aradama:** AAAAaaaa\.\.\.  
**Karin:** Now, Hiyori\!  
**Hiyori:** Right\! --HAAAAHH\!  
**Karin:** There don't seem to be any more aradama in sight for now, but what do you think\?  
**Hiyori:** Judging from the report, there should be a few more of them, but we don't seem likely to make contact with any more around here\.  
**Hiyori:** Why don't we move positions some while keeping on the alert\.  
**Karin:** Alright\. We should rehydrate now, while we have the opportunity\.  
**Hiyori:** Good idea\. [gulp gulp\]\.\.\.  
**Karin:** I'll take some supplements too\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** \!\?  
**Hiyori:** (Just how many does she have\!\?\)  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.Hey, why are you taking so many supplements\?  
**Karin:** It's a part of keeping my body in healthy condition, of course\. If I were getting sick often, I wouldn't be able to function as a Hero\.  
**Hiyori:** You have a point, but can't you get the nutrition you need from proper meals\?  
**Karin:** \.\.\.I do eat proper meals too, whenever possible\. [crunch crunch\]\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.And after supplements, you pull out niboshi\.  
**Karin:** You see, niboshi doesn't just give you calcium, but also a whole host of vitamins, DPA, and EHA\.  
**Karin:** And, since all the varieties of niboshi means you'll never get tired of it, it wouldn't be unreasonable to call it the perfect food\.  
**Hiyori:** You like niboshi, huh\. So that's why they called you \"Nibosshi\"\.  
**Karin:** Sonoko's the only one who calls me that, okay\.\.\.\!  
**Karin:** Here, do you want some too\?  
**Hiyori:** I guess I'll have some\. Prioritizing your health is just as important for a toji\.  
**Hiyori:** [crunch crunch\]\.\.\. These are good\.  
**Karin:** Aren't they\? I'm glad I got paired with someone who can understand the quality of niboshi\.  
**Hiyori:** I do like Japanese foods\. I eat niboshi too, from time to time\.  
**Karin:** What's your favorite food, Hiyori\?  
**Hiyori:** That would be nimono, and\.\.\. Chocolate mint\.  
**Karin:** You said you liked Japanese foods\.\.\. I didn't expect to hear chocolate mint from you\.  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Karin:** If you think up a type of chocolate mint you'd recommend, then let me know\. I want to try it\. Before I go back to our world\.  
**Hiyori:** \! Sure, you can look forward to it\!  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.Sorry, I didn't mean to raise my voice just now\.  
**Karin:** Hiyori\.\.\. You love chocolate mint a lot, don't you\.  
**Hiyori:** I-I won't deny that\. Anyway, let's go look for the rest of the aradama\.  
**Karin:** This one is a bit bigger and more of a handful\.\.\. But, with Hiyori and I, we can manage\!  
**Hiyori:** --This is the finish\!  
**Karin:** Was that the last one\?  
**Hiyori:** Yeah\. We finished suppressing the aradama sooner than scheduled\. Thanks; it's because I had your help\.  
**Karin:** It wasn't any trouble for me to come along\.  
**Hiyori:** This one's only chocolate mint flavor convenience store ice cream, but it's pretty good\.  
**Karin:** I'll have some then\. \.\.\.Nn\!  
**Karin:** No wonder you recommended this; this is great\.  
**Hiyori:** That's good to hear\.\.\. Sometimes, you get someone making senseless comments like \"chocolate mint is toothpaste\"\.  
**Karin:** Isn't that because toothpaste is just mint flavored, and not that chocolate mint tastes like toothpaste\?  
**Hiyori:** You got it, you really get it\. It's such a relief you're one of the ones who understands, Karin\.  
**Karin:** It's not that big a deal\. Come on, we should head back soon\.  
**Hiyori:** That's true\. I still have plenty more to recommend you\. I'll give you the rest of them on the train\.  
**Karin:** Hey\.\.\. They aren't all chocolate mint, are they\?

## [Fantasy - Hiyori: Start\]: Welcome to the World of Fantasy
**Tsugumi:** Thank you for participating in today's test of our new training simulation system, Juujou-san, Morishita-san\.  
**Hiyori:** I don't mind helping, but\.\.\. Why is Morishita-san here\? She's from the equipment department, isn't she\?  
**Kihiro:** That would be to seek out inspiration, Miss Juujou\!  
**Hiyori:** Miss Juujou\.\.\.\?  
**Kihiro:** I may be a gen\~ius, but constant output runs the well of my talents dry\!  
**Kihiro:** Sometimes I like to get myself in harm's way\~\!  
**Hiyori:** I-Is that right\.\.\.  
**Kihiro:** Now then, Miss Juujou\! Let's go on our grand adventure\!  
**Tsugumi:** Morishita-san, I hadn't finished explaining for Juujou-san yet\.  
**Kihiro:** Whoops, how rude of me\! I was getting ahead of myself\!  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.  
**Tsugumi:** Juujou-san\?  
**Hiyori:** I-I'm fine\. Just, getting a little overwhelmed by Morishita-san\.\.\.  
**Tsugumi:** Please keep up as best you can\.  
**Tsugumi:** This VR based combat training will be using a fantasy theme\.  
**Hiyori:** Fantasy\?  
**Tsugumi:** The enemies are still aradama, of course\.  
**Tsugumi:** Though, since we can make use of VR, there were requests for us to make it more fun to train in\.  
**Kihiro:** And so we're able to take a great journey across the world of fantasy\~\!  
**Hiyori:** I got it\. So long as I can still fight aradama like usual, there won't be an issue\.  
**Kihiro:** You're very reliable, Miss Juujou\! I'll do all I can to support you too\~\!  
**Hiyori:** Support me\? What are you going to be doing in VR, Morishita-san\?  
**Kihiro:** The character I'm playing is a support type\! I can use simple attack magic of course, but giving support from the rear is my specialty\!  
**Kihiro:** I'll give you just the support you need, Miss Juujou\!  
**Hiyori:** Y-You will then\.\.\.  
**Tsugumi:** With that, let's start setting things up\.  
**Tsugumi:** Data from your training will be collected automatically, so, once you've decided you've done enough, go and defeat the final boss\. The simulation will end then\.  
**Kihiro:** Understood, Miss Ban\! Let's bring down the final boss together, buddy\!  
**Hiyori:** Y-Yeah\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** (\.\.\.\.\.\.I'm not so sure about this\.\)  

## [Fantasy - Hiyori: End\]: Cheering Drone\!
**Aradama:** GYAAGYAA\!  
**Hiyori:** Gh\.\.\. Their attack power keeps going up\.\.\.\!  
**Kihiro:** At times like these, leave it to me\! Activate magic: Cheering Drone\!  
**Kihiro:** Go now, Miss Juujou\! Bring down the aradama while your defense is boosted\!  
**Hiyori:** HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Aradama:** GYAAAAAAA\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** Thanks, Morishita-san\.  
**Kihiro:** It's only reasonable I'd do this much\!  
**Kihiro:** By the way, along with boosting defenses, Cheering Drone has one more hidden effect\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** D-Does it\.\.\.\?  
**Hiyori:** (I wasn't sure how this would turn out, but things are going well so far\.\)  
**Hiyori:** (\.\.\.Though, it's hard keeping up with Morishita-san\.\)  
**Kihiro:** You know, this was more intriguing than I was expecting\! Miss Ban and her team have done a good job\!  
**Hiyori:** She's right that this feels more like a game than usual training\. This should make it easy for toji who don't like practicing to get into\.  
**Kihiro:** And it would be even more fun forming a party with friends\~\!  
**Kihiro:** If I could request something, I'd want for it to be enhanced into a fully open world style VR game\.  
**Kihiro:** Add in a plethora of skills, and it would fly off shelves if put out for sale\. Then research funds would come pouring in\!  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.Leaving that aside, did you get any inspiration for making equipment\?  
**Kihiro:** I certainly did\! The spark of inspiration's shining bright\! My plan is to shut myself in the laboratory as soon as we return\!  
**Hiyori:** Alright\. We've fought enough battles, so we should be ready\.  
**Hiyori:** She told us the training ends when we beat the final boss\.\.\.  
**Kihiro:** We can travel through the map to the final boss room at any time\. Are you prepared to go\?  
**Hiyori:** Yeah, let's go\.  
**Tsugumi:** Thank you for going through the training\. This allowed me to get some nice data\.  
**Hiyori:** That's good\.  
**Tsugumi:** You can do it some other day, but I want you to submit a report on your personal experience with it\.  
**Hiyori:** Got it\. Though, it was pretty incredible\.  
**Hiyori:** It was like we really were on a fantasy adventure\.  
**Kihiro:** Miss Ban\! Whenever you're going to update this game, please let me know\!  
**Kihiro:** I'd like to make equipment for it\~\!  
**Tsugumi:** That\.\.\. does sound interesting\.  
**Kihiro:** Some equipment might be too dangerous to use in the real world, but, inside there, woohoo\!  
**Tsugumi:** Fufu, I could get some good data from that\.  
**Kihiro:** Miss Ban\!  
**Tsugumi:** Morishita-san\!  
**Hiyori:** (I get the feeling two people who should never team up just got put together\.\.\.\)

## [Pirate - Hiyori: Start\]: Inami and Shichinosato and\.\.\.
**Aradama:** KSHAAAAAA\.\.\.\!\!  
**Suu:** \.\.\.I-It's here\!\?  
**Hiyori:** (There's no way she'll beat it hunched over in fear like that--\)  
**Suu:** Uwah\!\? Uwahh\!\?  
**Hiyori:** HAAH\.\.\.\!  
**Aradama:** GUOOooo\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** Honestly\.\.\. What are you even doing\? Calm down and hold your okatana properly\. Are you trying to get yourself hurt\?  
**Suu:** \.\.\.G-Got it\! Thank you so much, Juujou-san\!  
**Suu:** You really did help me out back there\.\.\.\! I wasn't sure what would happen for a minute\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** I get that you're scared, but\.\.\. If you keep acting like that on missions, you're going to get hurt someday\. You and your--  
**Ellen:** Hiyoyon, Inamin\! Good news, I have a surprise for you-\.  
**Hiyori:** Nn\? What do you mean, Ellen\?  
**Ellen:** Get this\. The amusement park people asked if we wanted to try playing with their new attraction\.  
**Ellen:** It's a special service, since us toji are always working so hard\.  
**Suu:** You don't mean\.\.\. \"Treasures of the Pirates\"\.\.\.\!  
**Ellen:** You sure do know your stuff, Inamin\.  
**Ellen:** Everyone else can't wait to try it, so, will you two be joining in\?  
**Hiyori:** Sure\. Can't exactly\.\.\. be the only one going back early\.  
**Ellen:** Fufu, thanks for that\~\.  
**Hiyori:** What's this attraction like\?  
**Ellen:** From the sound of it, we're all pirates searching for treasure\. You can steal maps from other pirates too\.\.\. the other people competing to get the treasure, so there's different ways to play\.  
**Hiyori:** You can steal maps from the other players\?  
**Suu:** It's sort of a team battle treasure hunt, but all the maps each team gets are different, and some of them are supposed to be fakes\.  
**Hiyori:** I see\. It sounds a bit tough\. How about let Kofuki know and head over for now\.  
**Suu:** U-Um\.\.\. I'll let you two tell Shichinosato-san about this by yourselves\.  
**Ellen:** Sure thing\. Don't worry\. I'll break it to Fukki so she'll join us for sure-\!  
**Suu:** I-I leave it to you\.\.\.\!  
**Suu:** \.\.\.So then, we'll be aiming to clear \"Treasures of the Pirates\" with the teams we were in fighting aradama before\.\.\.  
**Suu:** But, what should we do\? Juujou-san, Shichinosato-san\.\.\.  
**Kofuki:** I don't really have a choice, so I'll do this with you; at least till we get to the X on the map\.  
**Hiyori:** Are we fine with not going after the other team's maps\?  
**Kofuki:** Mihocchi was all, \"Let's plunder-\!\" but if the map you steal's no good, there's no point\.  
**Suu:** \.\.\.I think that's fine\! It's important to clear the game fast too\!  
**Hiyori:** There is a time limit; they were saying it goes until the cannons fire 3 times\.  
**Suu:** It should be just about thirty minutes\.  
**Hiyori:** We might be hard on time if we get in fights\.  
**Hiyori:** There's a drawing like a cave on our treasure map, so we should go there first\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** You can hold onto the map\.  
**Kofuki:** You know I'm just here to make the team's even, right\?  
**Hiyori:** Suu's\.\.\. not the most reliable\.  
**Kofuki:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Kofuki:** Tch\.\.\. Guess if I've gotta\.  
**Suu:** Ehh\.\.\. As long as there aren't any aradama, I'm not like that\! \.\.\.I won't lose the map, okay\!\?  

## [Pirate - Hiyori: End\]: This Might Not Be So Bad Every Now and Then\.\.\. Huh
**Suu:** I didn't think the cave drawing on the map would take us to a big stalactite cave facility, and they even had a boat for us\. This has to be it--  
**Suu:** --HYAUU\!\?  
**Kofuki:** Don't shout like that outta nowhere\.\.\. You made me jump\.  
**Suu:** But some water dripped on me\! They made this way too real in some weird places\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** Anyway, you were just saying you thought this was it; why's that\?  
**Suu:** They put a lot of effort into making this place, so I don't think they'd go this far if the right treasure wasn't here\.  
**Kofuki:** Putting it pretty straight out there\. Though, this does feel like the kinda place that'd have a pirate treasure\.  
**Hiyori:** So that's another way of looking for it\. Then, there's a good chance the treasure's up ahead\.  
**Suu:** The old pirates' treasured pendants should be here\. Finding that is the best way to get points in this game\.  
**Hiyori:** Oi\.\.\. Look\! Over there\.  
**Suu:** Wow\.\.\. That's a super realistic looking skeleton\!  
**Kofuki:** This must be it\. Hey you, go and get the thing\.  
**Suu:** Roger that-\. Inami Suu is setting off-\.  
**Aradama:** GYUUU\.\.\.\!  
**Suu:** GYAAH\!\? Something came out\!\?  
**Suu:** \.\.\.A-A-A-Aradamaaa\!\?  
**Kofuki:** \.\.\.What\!\? After it\!  
**Aradama:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Kofuki:** You're running around all over the place, but this is it\!  
**Hiyori:** It was so small it hardly showed up on the spectrum finder, so it's a good thing we found it\.  
**Kofuki:** There might be others around; let's look\.  
**Hiyori:** Should we message Ellen and Kiyoka and them\?  
**Kofuki:** Shouldn't have to\. The two of us are enough\. Well, I could do it myself though\.  
**Hiyori:** Maybe you could, but you shouldn't go alone\.  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.What about Suu\?  
**Kofuki:** There was just one of them, so she'll be fine back there\. Let's get this done as fast as we can\.  
**Suu:** Even if\.\.\. I don't want to fight aradama\.\.\. I thought it was really mean the way you left me behind\!  
**Kofuki:** We still came back fast enough\.  
**Suu:** I think that place might have been starting to give me a fear of the dark too\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** Though from the looks of it, it didn't\.  
**Hiyori:** And anyway, thanks to you, we got the pendant\.  
**Suu:** Juujou-san, are you\.\.\. trying really poorly to make me feel better\?  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.Urgh\. I do feel a little bad\.  
**Kofuki:** Next time something happens, I'll beat some aradama-chan for you to make up for it\.  
**Hiyori:** And you\.\.\. You just want to hunt aradama yourself, am I wrong\?  
**Suu:** That's right, tell her some more\!  
**Kofuki:** Oh\! Mihocchi and Kiyoka are headed over\. Go shove this pendant in their faces, Hunchback\.  
**Suu:** Hunchback\!\? Could you please not call me weird names\.\.\. It's rude\!  
**Hiyori:** Good grief\.\.\.  

## [Furisode 21 - Hiyori: Start\]: Picking Out Furisode
**Hiyori:** You know\.\.\. It's crazy how many furisode there are\.  
**Ellen:** Keep the praise coming, Hiyoyon\! I worked hard to get all these together\!  
**Hiyori:** I wasn't really meaning to praise you; it's just impressive seeing this many laid out\.  
**Ellen:** Ehh, you weren't giving me compliments-\?  
**Kaoru:** Do we really owe you compliments for this-\?  
**Kaoru:** You're the one who was acting all spoiled saying we all had to wear furisode\.  
**Ellen:** You're such a meanie, Kaoru\. It's the cute kind of spoiled, isn't it\?  
**Kaoru:** The number of furisode you got goes way past cute into freaky\.  
**Kanami:** Come on, Kaoru-chan\.  
**Kanami:** This really is amazing, Ellen-chan\! There's so many cute ones; I'll have a hard time picking just one\!  
**Kanami:** Did you already decide on one, Hiyori-chan, Kaoru-chan\?  
**Kaoru:** Yeah; there's not that many that fit me after all\.  
**Hiyori:** For me\.\.\. Alright, I'll go with this one\. I like these more subdued colors\.  
**Ellen:** Nice going Hiyoyon, picking that one out\!  
**Kaoru:** Yeah, I think you've got pretty good taste too\.  
**Hiyori:** Y-You think so\?  
**Ellen:** Yes\! Out of all the furisode here, that one's the most expensive\!  
**Hiyori:** Huh\?  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.B-By the way, just how much did it cost\.\.\.\?  
**Ellen:** [whisper whisper whisper\]\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** Seriously\!\?  
**Kanami:** Uwah\!\? Eh\? How much was it\!\?  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.You're better off not knowing, Kanami\. I'm picking something else, Ellen\.  
**Kaoru:** Was it really that much\.\.\.\?  
**Kaoru:** I'm getting scared to actually pick one of these\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** Now I have to know\! Tell it to me, Ellen-chan\!  
**Hiyori:** Don't, Kanami\! You're going to regret hearing it\!  
**Ellen:** [whisper whisper whisper\]\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** \.\.\.\.\.\.I shouldn't have asked\.  
**Hiyori:** That's what I told you\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** But still, we have to choose one of these to wear\.\.\. Let's pick one and be prepared for the worst, Kanami\!  
**Kanami:** Yeah, Hiyori-chan\!  
**Ellen:** Hahaha\! This is fun, Kaoru\!  
**Kaoru:** Only for you, maybe\.  

## [Furisode 21 - Hiyori: End\]: Is Winter a Special Case\?
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.It's completely packed here\.  
**Kaoru:** Geh, are we seriously getting in that line\? Who knows how many hours it'll be before we make it to the shrine\.  
**Ellen:** We'd be spending a whole lot of time doing nothing, wouldn't we\.  
**Kanami:** Then\.\.\. How about we do our own thing until the line gets shorter\?  
**Kaoru:** Sure, that should be fine\.  
**Ellen:** If that's what we're doing, lets go draw our fortunes, Kaoru\!  
**Kaoru:** Hang on; don't drag me\!  
**Ellen:** Let's go\!  
**Hiyori:** That's them gone\.  
**Kanami:** Yeah\. We should\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** Sorry, that's Mai-chan calling\.  
**Hiyori:** (So, now that we have some free time, what should we do\? Ellen and Kaoru went off to get their fortunes\.\.\.\)  
**Kanami:** Okay\. Then, I'll see you later\.  
**Kanami:** I told Mai-chan we'll meet up with her later\.  
**Hiyori:** Oh\. Then, what are we doing now\?  
**Kanami:** I dunno\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** Ah\.  [Kanami's stomach rumbles\]  
**Hiyori:** Guess we're going with that\.  
**Hiyori:** Takoyaki, yakisoba, and\.\.\. There's lots of different stalls set up\. What do you want, Kanami\?  
**Kanami:** Mmm, I'm not sure\.\.\. I think I want to have takoyaki\. Steamy hot takoyaki\! I'll be right back\!  
**Hiyori:** That's her gone too\.  
**Hiyori:** Fine; what should I have\? I'm not really in the mood for takoyaki or yakisoba\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** Nn\? They have an ice cream stand\? It's the middle of winter; there's some strange people out there\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** That's--\!\!  
**Kanami:** I'm back-\.\.\. Wait, Hiyori-chan, why'd you get ice cream\? And it's chocolate mint too\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** Th-They were selling it, so what's wrong with that\!\?  
**Kanami:** Well, there's nothing wrong with it\.\.\. Anyway, let's eat\!  
**Kanami:** Mmm, it's hot and tasty\!  
**Hiyori:** This chocolate mint is cool and tasty too\.  
**Kanami:** It's crunchy on the outside\! And gooey on the inside\! The octopus is so tender, Hiyori-chan\!  
**Hiyori:** You can really taste the chocolate mint in this\.  
**Kanami:** \.\.\.Want one of mine\?
