## 1: Let's Think Up Entertainment
**Ellen:** Kaoruuu, Chieee\!  
**Ellen:** We have to go to the committee meeting for the Five Traditions Unified End of the Year Recognition Party\!  
**Kaoru:** Ugh, do I have to?  
**Ellen:** Don't talk like that before you even try it, Kaoru\! I'm sure it'll be a lot of fun\!  
**Chie:** I agree, Kaoru-san.  
**Chie:** On top of that, there are lots of middle school girls grouped with us, so as their onee-sans, it's our duty to guide them.  
**Ellen:** We can be Team Osafune Onee-sans\!  
**Kaoru:** Pass. Unlike you two, I'm not onee-san material.  
**Chie:** Don't be silly. You'd make a fine onee-san, Kaoru-san.  
**Kaoru:** Even if I act all like "I'm your onee-san, teehee"... Look at me?  
**Kaoru:** I don't have those fine persuasive qualities like you do to pull it off.  
**Chie:** Persuasive qualities... Just where do you think you're looking?  
**Kaoru:** Hey, that reaction... You're self-conscious about it?  
**Chie:** Kaoru-san\!  
**Ellen:** ...Well if you don't like it, then that's that. We can be Team Osafune Mashiko instead\!  
**Kaoru:** That's even worse\!  
**Ellen:** And why's that?  
**Kaoru:** The name makes it sound like I'm in charge. That's way too much work.  
**Chie:** Now then, let's start the meeting. Our members are...  
**Chie:** Mm, everyone's here.  
**Mai:** Our group is in charge of the entertainment for the recognition party.  
**Kanami:** Konohana-san, who's leading the committee, said to come up with something that could "satisfactorily conclude the year".  
**Ellen:** I want to make a bigger attraction than the main event\! We can't lose to Hanahana\!  
**Kaoru:** How're we supposed to stand out more than the main event though?  
**Hashi Keiko:** (H-Huh? Why does it seem like everyone already knows each other?)  
**Keiko:** (I'm being left out... I can't join the conversation... It's too much for an outsider like me...)  
**Mihono:** Wait wait, stooop\!  
**Kaoru:** Nn? What's up, Mihono? If you have to go to the bathroom, hurry it up.  
**Mihono:** That's okay, I already went before the meeting\!  
**Mihono:** But what I mean is, shouldn't we all introduce ourselves first? Hashi-san looks really lost.ã€€  
**Keiko:** (I might as well not be here... I have to get back to my monkey wrench and...)  
**Keiko:** Wh-Why is everyone looking at me\!\? D-Did you want me to come up with something\!\?  
**Chie:** Fufu, you're always watching out for others, Mihono-chan. Since we toji all know each other, we went straight into the meeting, didn't we?  
**Ellen:** Nice thinking, Mihomiho\! Let's introduce ourselves\! I'm Kohagura Ellen, from Osafune Girls' Academy\!  
**Keiko:** Ah... Hello, nice to meet you. I'm Hashi Keiko, taking preparatory courses in engineering at Ayanokouji Martial Arts School...  
**Chie:** I'll go next. I'm from Osafune Girls' Academy...  
**Chie:** Now that we all know each other, we can start the meeting properly. If you want to make any suggestions, don't hesitate to tell us, okay, Hashi-san?  
**Keiko:** Y-Yes, I will. I'll try... But if I don't have much to say, I'm sorry...  
**Ellen:** You're funny, Hajihaji\!  
**Keiko:** Th-Thank you...  
**Kanami:** Setouchi-san, for the entertainment... Could we do something like the official tournament?  
**Kaoru:** Oi oi, do you have any idea how many toji there are in the Five Traditions?  
**Kanami:** Enough to let us have plenty of matches with all kinds of toji\!  
**Chie:** That certainly would feel like a conclusion to the year, but... Wouldn't it be hard to organize? Maybe we should think of something more simple...  
**Kanami:** Hmm, that's too bad then\!  
**Mai:** It has to be fun and entertaining, while also concluding the year...  
**Mai:** It's difficult, isn't it, Mihono-chan.  
**Mihono:** I feel like smoke's gonna start coming out of my ears\~\! I wanna eat something sweet\!  
**Mai:** Ah, in that case, I have these sakura macarons. Want one?  
**Mihono:** Of course\! Thanks, Mai\!  
**Kanami:** Oh, I want one too\! Mmm\~, macarons are so good\!  
**Keiko:** Um, Yanase-san, those macarons... Nevermind.  
**Mai:** I have plenty to go around, so don't worry. Here you go, Hashi-san.  
**Keiko:** Thank you very much. ...Ah, it's good.  
**Mihono:** Right? Mai's really good at cooking\!  
**Kanami:** She can make cookies and all kinds of stuff, and they're all super tasty.  
**Keiko:** Not only are you a toji, but you're also good at cooking... You're amazing, Yanase-san...\!  
**Mai:** I-It's not that amazing\~.  
**Keiko:** ...This is so good that, maybe, we could make everyone compete for Yanase-san's cooking...  
**Kaoru:** Now there's an eccentric idea.  
**Ellen:** But it sounds like fun too\!  
**Ellen:** We could set up a lot of prizes and a raffle, and start a battle royale\!  
**Chie:** What if we gave every toji a raffle ticket, and they had to try and take each other's while protecting their own...?  
**Chie:** We could call it a raffle competition\!  
**Kaoru:** That's taking it pretty literally.  
**Ellen:** You don't get it, Kaoru\! That's what's great about it\!  
**Chie:** Does anyone have any objections...?  
**Mai:** It isn't really an objection, but... How are students that aren't toji meant to participate?  
**Chie:** Ah, you're right, we didn't think of that...  
**Keiko:** Um, in that case... What if we gave the average number of raffle tickets the executive committee gets to all the non-toji students?  
**Keiko:** That way, you can join in supporting someone and have fun even if you're not fighting... Would that work?  
**Chie:** I like the sound of that\! Thank you, Hashi-san\!  
**Chie:** We'll go with that then. The entertainment at the recognition party will be a raffle competition\!  

## 2: What Do We Want?
**Suzuka:** A... Raffle competition?  
**Chie:** Yes. We give raffle tickets to all the toji, and they compete over them for fun.  
**Suzuka:** While acting as a conclusion to the year, it also sounds entertaining... I like it.  
**Suzuka:** Very well. This year, we will carry out a raffle competition.  
**Chie:** Okay, thank you\!  
**Suzuka:** With that settled, next we need to think of what prizes will be in the raffle. Have you come up with a list?  
**Chie:** Ah, not yet, we'll be deciding on the prizes in our next meeting.  
**Suzuka:** Then this works out nicely. Please include dresses as prizes.  
**Chie:** Now then, let's think up what to put in the raffle\!  
**Mai:** We have to include dresses?  
**Chie:** Yes. Konohana-san said, since we're having a big party, suggestions like that would be interesting.  
**Mihono:** Dresses, huh... Wouldn't it be hard working up the courage to wear a dress while everyone's in uniform, Kanami?  
**Kanami:** I know, Mihono-chan. I think it'd be hard to move around in too.  
**Keiko:** (The conversation is getting off-topic... But it'd be better not to interrupt them...)  
**Ellen:** Can we put whatever we want in the raffle, Chie?  
**Chie:** Mmhm, anything within common sense.  
**Kaoru:** ......Time off.  
**Mai:** Eh? What was that, Kaoru-chan?  
**Kaoru:** ...I want time off.  
**Chie:** "Time off", there.  
**Kaoru:** That'll work\!\?  
**Chie:** It'll be more fun if there's all kinds of prizes in there. Feel free to come up with suggestions like Kaoru-san did, everyone.  
**Ellen:** I'd like an all-you-can-eat dessert buffet\!  
**Mihono:** Or what about a free pass for the cafeteria?  
**Ellen:** It's a big occasion, so let's put in both\! The more you can win, the better it gets\!  
**Chie:** "Dessert buffet", "Cafeteria pass". Did you come up with anything, Etou-san, Yanase-san?  
**Kanami:** Would a swordfight ticket work? You can use it to have a match with anyone you want.  
**Mai:** I thought you'd go with something like that, Kanami-chan.  
**Mai:** In my case... Why not an increase to club funding, or a chance to spend a day with the elite guard?  
**Chie:** "Swordfight ticket", "Club funding", "Spend a day with the elite guard"...  
**Ellen:** What about you, Hajihaji?  
**Keiko:** Me\!\?  
**Ellen:** You don't have to think too hard about it. Just say whatever you want to do.  
**Keiko:** What I want to do... Then, servicing the Storm Armor, but with my skills...  
**Ellen:** Worrying about it won't get you anywhere, Hajihaji. If you do screw something up, you can use that experience next time. It's no problem.  
**Keiko:** N-No problem? B-But, if I screw up, then the consequences...  
**Ellen:** Then, let's think about how to get you some help with that\!  
**Chie:** What's important is a helper for your preparatory classes, right? Then you need someone to support you... We need to recruit people in advance.  
**Chie:** And, when it comes to servicing... If nothing's wrong, you'll want to see a practical test of it. So we need to have toji ready too...  
**Chie:** Ah, but, there's a chance someone from the engineering courses won't draw that prize. We have to make sure it works in case a toji draws it... Is there anything else we should consider?  
**Keiko:** N-No, if I have someone helping me, I think I should be fine.  
**Keiko:** But... I-Is this really okay?  
**Chie:** As a preparatory engineering student, this would be a great experience for you, wouldn't it?  
**Chie:** That's why I'm glad to have your point of view. Thank you, Hashi-san.  
**Keiko:** Y-You don't need to thank me for anything...  
**Chie:** See, most of us here are toji, aren't we?  
**Chie:** So, even if we try, it's hard to represent students from other departments. But we should think of prizes that everyone from the Five Traditions can have fun with\!  
**Suzuka:** I see you took into account students from all departments. These prizes should do fine.  
**Suzuka:** I'll make an announcement summarizing the raffle competition to the Five Traditions.  
**Kaoru:** We don't have to do anything to help with that, right?  
**Suzuka:** Not at all. You're doing more than enough by preparing the party's entertainment.  
**Suzuka:** ...I'm curious, why did you come this time in place of Setouchi-san?  
**Kaoru:** ...I'm just that serious about this project. I want to make sure it's a success, no matter what.  
**Suzuka:** How reliable of you. You've been a great help, Mashiko-san.  

## 3: Hashi Vanished
**Toji A:** Hey, did you see what they're doing for the recognition party's entertainment?  
**Toji B:** I did\! A raffle competition, right? I want that all-you-can-eat dessert buffet\!  
**Toji A:** I'm more interested in spending a day with the elite guard. You could get to work with Shidou-san\!  
**Toji B:** Better collect all the raffle tickets you can\! Things are gonna get serious when it starts, you know?  
**Toji A:** Same goes for you\!  
**Keiko:** Uuu... People are already talking about the raffle competition.  
**Keiko:** I'm happy about getting to service Storm Armor, but... Can someone like me really handle that...  
**Keiko:** The nervousness is making my stomach hurt... Maintenance... It doesn't matter what, I have to do maintenance on something...  
**Mihono:** Let's start today's work on preparing for the raffle competition\!  
**Kanami:** Oh, hold up, Mihono-chan. I don't think Hashi-san's here yet.  
**Mai:** Hashi-san's never been late before... Setouchi-san, did she tell you anything?  
**Chie:** I haven't heard from her. Maybe we should send someone to look for her?  
**Ellen:** Sure thing\! I'm on it\!  
**Chie:** Thank you, Ellen-san. I think it would help if we sent at least one more person though...  
**Kaoru:** Pass. I'll be here to fill in Ellen's share while she's gone.  
**Ellen:** What're you working so hard for, Kaoru?  
**Kaoru:** I'm trying to rack up enough good karma to win that time off.  
**Nene:** Ne-\!  
**Kanami:** That explains it. In that case, I'll go with Ellen-chan.  
**Ellen:** Hi\! Let's go, Kanamin\!  
**Ellen:** Hajihaji's not here, Kanamin. Where could she have gone?  
**Kanami:** I know she was here after school ended.  
**Kanami:** Somebody said she was walking around looking all dizzy.  
**Ellen:** Walking around all dizzy... That sounds like trouble\! Hajihaji must be in the infirmary or the dorms\!  
**Ellen:** I'll check the infirmary\! You go see her dorm room, Kanamin\!  
**Kanami:** Okay\!  
**Keiko:** Ughh....  
**Kanami:** Hashi-san, are you in there? Huh, the door's unlocked... I'm coming in.  
**Keiko:** ...  
**Kanami:** Oh, there you are... Hey, are you okay\!\? You're as pale as a ghost\!\?  
**Keiko:** Why is Etou-san here...?  
**Kanami:** I came because we were worried about you\!  
**Keiko:** I made Etou-san and the others worry about me... My life is over...  
**Kanami:** It's still going on though\!\?  
**Kanami:** Hold on, I have to message Ellen-chan real quick\!  
**Kanami:** ...So basically, you wanted to do maintenance on Storm Armor so badly that it made you nervous, so you hardly slept in order to study servicing it?  
**Keiko:** ...Yes. I can't fall asleep unless I've done some maintenance...  
**Ellen:** Have you been up all this time? You're working yourself too hard, Hajihaji.  
**Keiko:** But I'm nervous... I have to distract myself with some maintenance...  
**Keiko:** Pliers are the best... Screws are cute... My heaven is here...  
**Ellen:** Oh\! Hajihaji has a metal fetish.  
**Keiko:** That's not it...  
**Kanami:** Anyway, you have to relax, Hashi-san. Maybe Setouchi-san will have some advice to help you?  
**Keiko:** Even though I'm causing you so much trouble... Thank you so much. You must be goddess, Etou-san...  
**Kanami:** I'm not though\!\?  
**Ellen:** And that's how Kanamin became goddess\!  
**Mihono:** Haha-\! Goddess Kanami-sama\!  
**Kanami:** I said I'm not\!  
**Chie:** Etou-san. What did Hashi-san have to say?  
**Kanami:** Oh, yeah. If it's possible, she wants to focus on some kind of behind the scenes work that lets her use tools.  
**Chie:** Okay, then let's let her do that. And also, we'll try to give her free time to practice maintenance in, okay?  
**Mihono:** That's a good idea, Chii-nee\! I'll go tell Hashi-san\!  
**Kanami:** Ah, wait up, Mihono-chan\! I'll go too\!  
**Kaoru:** And they're gone. Did you want to go too, Mai?  
**Mai:** I do, but... It's best not to surround her with too many people when she's not feeling well.  
**Kaoru:** Okay. Then, we'll have to work extra hard to make up for them while they're gone.  
**Nene:** Ne-\!  

## 4: Kaoru's Plan
**Mihono:** Huh\!\?  
**Kaoru:** What happened, Mihono? Did you forget something?  
**Mihono:** I didn't, but... Uhh, right now, I was going over the orders for the amount of prizes, and...  
**Nene:** Nene-?  
**Mihono:** The order for the dresses... There's enough dresses for all of the students.  
**Kaoru:** Huh\!\? Oi\! Who's the one that ordered the dresses\!\?  
**Kaoru:** No, call up the supplier before anything...  
**Mai:** Oh, that's not a mistake. Konohana-san placed the order for the dresses, so it's alright.  
**Kaoru:** ...The elite guard are something else.  
**Ellen:** Apparently, that's what happened, Chie. It's weird to see Kaoru acting like such a leader.  
**Chie:** Did Team Onee-sans get to her after all?  
**Ellen:** I don't really know. It's not like she's guaranteed to get the time off if she works harder...  
**Ellen:** But, I do think it's good she's getting so involved\!  
**Chie:** I agree. We have to follow the example she's setting\!  
**Ellen:** Of course\! Whether it's the preparation or the main event, let's make it as fun as we can\!  
**Kaoru:** ...Nene. I'm trying hard at getting things set up, right?  
**Nene:** Nene-\!  
**Kaoru:** And everyone can tell, right?  
**Nene:** Ne-\!  
**Kaoru:** Then... Everything should be ready. If the time off won't come to me... I've gotta go to it.  
**Kaoru:** Hey, Mihono... You got a minute?  
**Mihono:** What's up, Kaoru-san?  
**Kaoru:** I wanted to ask you something... If, during the raffle competition, you get the time off... Could you give it to me?  
**Kaoru:** Of course, if there's something else you wanted, I'll give it to you if I get it. All I want is that time off.  
**Kaoru:** So... Please\!  
**Mihono:** You've been working so hard getting things ready, Kaoru-san... So sure\!  
**Mihono:** If I get the time off, I'll give it to you\!  
**Kaoru:** (...Just as planned\!)  
**Kaoru:** And Chie and Mai agreed. Too easy. Ah\! Heyyy, Ellen\!  
**Ellen:** Kaoru-\! What is it?  
**Kaoru:** If you get the time off from the raffle competition, give it to me.  
**Ellen:** ...Oh, so that's what you've been up to. This is why you were helping so much with the preparations, right?  
**Ellen:** You planned to show everyone how hard you were working, making it easier to convince them to give you their time off\!  
**Kaoru:** Sure did. Got a problem with it? I'm not taking any chances with that time off.  
**Kaoru:** It's not like it's guaranteed, but... With seven people, one of them is bound to get it.  
**Ellen:** Somehow, I'm relieved to see you acting more like yourself\! How about this... If you get the all-you-can-eat dessert buffet, then it's win-win for both of us, right?  
**Kaoru:** No problem. Is that negotiations settled?  
**Ellen:** I think so. So then, who are you going to ask next?  
**Kaoru:** Kanami... Wait, are you coming too?  
**Ellen:** Yes\! It sounds like fun, so I'll join you\!  
**Kanami:** Time off? Sure\!  
**Kaoru:** Thanks, Kanami.  
**Kanami:** In exchange, I'd be happy if you had a sparring session with me\!  
**Kaoru:** Well, that's about what I expected. I don't really want to, but... If that's what it takes.  
**Kanami:** Then, let's go right now\!  
**Kaoru:** ...Huh? Are you serious\!\?  
**Kanami:** We have plenty spare time, so we can fight all we want, Kaoru-chan\!  
**Ellen:** ...Kanamin loves a good fight after all\! Ooh, I thought up something good... Now I'm looking forward to the main event\!  

## 5: The Raffle Competition Begins\!
On the day of the End of the School Year Recognition Party--

  
**Suzuka:** With that, we will now begin the raffle competition.  
**Mai:** To start, as members of the executive committee, Setouchi-san, Hashi-san, and I will be overseeing the competition.  
**Chie:** Sorry, Hashi-san, for making you do so much committee work.  
**Keiko:** N-No, it's fine... I'll do what I can\!  
**Mihono:** Alright\! Me and Kanami will... Wait, where's Kanami\!\?  
**Ellen:** Kanamin went running off as soon as it started.  
**Mihono:** Uwaaah\! Where'd you go, Kanami-\!\?  
**Kaoru:** Guess I should get going too. Let's show 'em what we've got, Nene.  
**Nene:** Ne-\!  
**Ellen:** Whoa there, hold on a moment, Kaoru\!  
**Kaoru:** Nn? What do you want?  
**Ellen:** A hachimanriki surprise attack\!  
**Kaoru:** -\! Kongoushin\!  
**Ellen:** Oh\! Nicely blocked, Kaoru\!  
**Kaoru:** Don't give me that. The hell are you doing, attacking me out of nowhere?  
**Ellen:** Isn't it obvious... Kaoru, let's fight\!  
**Kaoru:** Ugh... No way\!  
**Kaoru:** Why should I fight you\! We don't get anything out of fighting other committee members\!  
**Ellen:** Kanamin's request for you gave me an idea...  
**Ellen:** A fight between best friends, with the raffle tickets on the line... Doesn't it get you fired up\!  
**Kaoru:** That's your reason\!\?  
**Ellen:** That's all the reason I need\!  
**Ellen:** And of course, if you don't fight me, forget about me giving you that time off\!  
**Kaoru:** That's playing dirty\!  
**Ellen:** That's a compliment to me\!  
**Kaoru:** We've got committee work to do too, so I wanted to get as much as I could now... You better not regret this later\!  
**Ellen:** That's it\! That's what I was looking for\! Now you're getting into it\!  
**Kaoru:** Tch\! RRRYAAA\!  
**Ellen:** Whoops, you're not going to hit me like that\!  
**Kaoru:** That's what... You think\!  
**Ellen:** Wow\!  
**Kaoru:** Now... We're done here\!  
**Ellen:** ...\!  
**Toji A:** You're wide open\! HAAAAAAH\!\!  
**Kaoru:** A sneak attack\!\?  
**Toji B:** You better be ready, Kohagura Ellen\!  
**Ellen:** There's one after me too\! Kaoru, let's have a ceasefire while we beat them\!  
**Kaoru:** Yeah, after we deal with you two, we can finish what we started\!  
**Kaoru:** Just kidding.  
**Ellen:** Huh\!\? Kaoru-? Where'd you go, Kaoru... Wah\!\?  
**Kaoru:** I saw my chance and took it. Those two should be able to keep Ellen busy for a while.  
**Nene:** Ne-?  
**Kaoru:** Don't worry about her. I've seriously gotta make up for lost time now.  
**Kaoru:** Let's get straight to collecting tickets.  
**Chie:** Kaoru-san\! You came at a good time\!  
**Kaoru:** ...I don't like the look of this, Nene.  
**Nene:** Ne.  
**Mai:** A few people were injured over here\! Come help us move them to the infirmary, Kaoru-chan\!  
**Kaoru:** I knew it-\! Just let me get raffle tickets-\!  

## 6: Who Will Lady Luck Favor?
**Kaoru:** I didn't get any tickets at all... They're working the committee to death...  
**Ellen:** Don't worry about it, Kaoru\! Even if you don't have a whole lot, I'm sure you'll still pull something good\!  
**Kaoru:** Hey, don't act like this isn't your fault. Who's the one who held me up right at the start?  
**Ellen:** But wasn't it a lot of fun, fighting each other seriously?  
**Keiko:** U-Um... Was it alright for me to receive a dress too?  
**Keiko:** I didn't draw a dress from the raffle...  
**Kaoru:** Kanami said it was fine, so there's nothing to worry about.  
**Kaoru:** But still, you had some crazy luck with your draws.  
**Keiko:** I can use the cafeteria ticket, though I don't know what to do with the club funding and day with the elite guard.  
**Keiko:** And... I'm sure I used up all my life's luck here...  
**Ellen:** You still have plenty more luck ahead of you, Hajihaji\!  
**Ellen:** Speaking of which, is Kanamin still not done with the raffle?  
**Keiko:** Ah, yes, she was halfway finished with all her draws when I last saw her.  
**Keiko:** I want to thank Etou-san for the dress, but... I don't think I can do it just yet.  
**Mihono:** And, from the half she got, most of them were dresses. It's pretty crazy how many of them are in there.  
**Mihono:** Kanami could totally open a dress store after this\!  
**Mai:** What did you get from the raffle, Mihono-chan?  
**Mihono:** Listen to this, Mai\~. Things were going good at first, but the second half of my draws were a total bust\~.  
**Mihono:** And whenever I won something from the raffle, it was all dresses too... How'd you do, Mai?  
**Mai:** Actually... I won the all-you-can-eat desserts\!  
**Ellen:** I'm so jealous, Maimai\!  
**Kaoru:** ...So Mai didn't get the time off either.  
**Kanami:** I'm back.  
**Mihono:** Hey, Kanami\! Here, I got a drink for you\!  
**Kanami:** Thanks, Mihono-chan. ...Phew, that hits the spot.  
**Keiko:** U-Um, Etou-san, this dress, thank you for giving it to me...\!  
**Kanami:** Don't mention it. I got the swordfight ticket, so I'm feeling generous\!  
**Mihono:** Ooh\! Congrats, Kanami\!  
**Kaoru:** ...I was betting on Kanami to get the time off, but that didn't work out either...  
**Kaoru:** Guess I really have to do it myself.  
**Ellen:** So you're finally taking your shot, Kaoru...\!  
**Kaoru:** Yeah... I only have this one ticket, but... I'll bet everything on it\!  
**Chie:** Oh, Kaoru-san. Are you here to try your luck?  
**Kaoru:** Hope it hasn't been too hard working the raffle. Did anybody get the time off yet?  
**Chie:** Don't worry, it's still in there. Go on, give it a draw, Kaoru-san.  
**Kaoru:** Ahh... It must be my fate to pull it now.  
**Kaoru:** ...Hah\!  
**Chie:** Congratulations, Kaoru-san\! You won the opportunity to monitor the Storm Armor test\!  
**Kaoru:** Monitoring... Am I gonna have to do this on top of my normal missions...  
**Ellen:** How'd it go, Kaoru?  
**Kaoru:** For now... I'm just going to eat.  
**Ellen:** Uh oh, it can't be good news then. Kaoru, maybe changing into your dress will make you feel better\~.  
**Kaoru:** I didn't get a dress.  
**Ellen:** That's alright\! I thought you might not, so I asked Kanamin for one\!  
**Kaoru:** Sigh, I can't do this. If I don't eat, I can't do this.  
**Sana:** Are you having a good time?  
**Kaoru:** Geh, it's the ha... the president.  
**Sana:** What was that you almost called me just now?  
**Kaoru:** Y-You're just hearing things?  
**Kaoru:** A-Anyway, it's alright. The food's pretty good at this party.  
**Sana:** Good, eat up then. Tomorrow, you've got work to do in Kyushu.  
**Kaoru:** Huh?  
**Ellen:** There you go again, Kaoru\! You're so loved by your job\!  
**Kaoru:** Is that supposed to make me feel better-\!\? Bring me another plate-\!  
**Kanami:** Ah, I can go get that.  
**Kaoru:** Great, thanks.  
**Keiko:** ...Um, did your raffle not go well?  
**Kaoru:** Yeah, I got Storm Armor monitoring duty.  
**Kaoru:** I work my ass off getting the raffle competition ready, and all I get is work in Kyushu and with Storm Armor\! If I don't eat my fill here, I can't go on like this\!  
**Ellen:** Nice thinking, Kaoru\!  
**Ellen:** You have to makes sure the Storm Armor Hajihaji does maintenance on gets a good testing\!  
**Keiko:** R-Right\! I'm glad it's going to be someone I know helping me\!  
**Kaoru:** There's nothing nice about this.  
**Kaoru:** If everybody did the raffle and nobody got the time off, then we should've worked on the rates some more\!  
**Mihono:** But this just means there's jobs that need your help\! Right, Mai?  
**Mai:** That's true; you must have a higher calling, Kaoru-san.  
**Kaoru:** And I'm not happy about it\! Somebody, just give me some time offff\!
