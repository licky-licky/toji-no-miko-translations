## [China - Yui: Start]: The Chinatown Date I've Longed For\!\?
**Tsugumi:** We've safely eliminated the aradama, so while we're here, why don't we take a stroll around Chinatown until the sun starts setting?  
**Mihono:** I'm all for it\~\! There's still a lot more shops I haven't been to yet. Do you two wanna come with me?  
**Yui:** Of course I do\!ã€€It's a Chinatown date with two good looking girls at my side\! This makes fighting off those aradama all worth it\~.  
**Yui:** Date\~\! Date\~\! Chinatown date\~\!  
**Mihono:** You're sure in a good mood, Yui.  
**Yui:** You know I am\! Taking a beauty like you on a date through Chinatown; that's the kind of classic date course I've been dreaming of\!  
**Tsugumi:** ...  
**Yui:** Hm? What's up, Tsugumi-san? Ah-- Don't tell me, you're getting jealous I'm giving Mihono-chan all the attention?  
**Tsugumi:** No, not once this whole time have I ever felt anything like that...  
**Yui:** Then, what's that uneasy look on your face for?  
**Tsugumi:** Sorry, it might be senseless of me to ask, but... I was just wondering, what is the definition of a "date" to begin with?  
**Yui:** Tsugumi-san, you're such a serious going girl. When it comes to things like this, it's all about "Don't think; feel\!\"  
**Tsugumi:** Go with your feelings without thinking... Is that it. Then, coming up with feelings regarding dating... How exactly do you do that?  
**Yui:** That's easy\! Right now, I'll swap between taking you and Mihono-chan on a Chinatown date with me, to give you the dating experience\!  
**Mihono:** The dating experience?  
**Yui:** Yeah\! I've spent a lot of time mentally rehearsing for the ultimate heart-pounding Chinatown date, so I'll show you a good time for sure\!  
**Tsugumi:** If you're that sure then, Yamashiro-san... It might not be so bad to get an experience of the real thing.  
**Yui:** That's the spirit\! So then, to start us off... I think I'll take out Mihono-chan\!  
**Mihono:** Ehh-- Starting with me\!\? If you just tell me we're going on a date like that, I don't have time to get my heart ready...  
**Yui:** Don't you worry about that, Honey. I'll escort you around just right. Why don't we find somewhere to get some delicious sweets first?  
**Yui:** This place sells the apricot seed soft serve that's the talk of Chinatown\! I don't have much pocket money on me today, so let's share one between us. Here, open wide.  
**Mihono:** Ahhn. [chew chew]... It's yummy-\!\!  
**Yui:** Alright, now it's your turn, Mihono-chan\! I'll say "ahh", and you...  
**Mihono:** Ah, look, look\! In that general store next door\! They've got cute panda things you can wear\!  
**Yui:** Ah, wait, Mihono-chaaan\!  
**Mihono:** Tadahhh\! Check it out\! See this panda hat I got\! Does it look good?  
**Yui:** Mmm\~\! It's good; so good\~\! Next up, let's try this Chinese hat\~\! Uwah\~\! This one looks good too\~.  
**Tsugumi:** ...  
**Tsugumi:** Um, would it be alright if we stopped for a moment?  
**Yui:** Hmmm? What's the matter, Tsugumi-san? Hahahn\~, now are you feeling jealous of me with Mihono-chan...  
**Tsugumi:** That's not it. It's just that, I've started to have my doubts about all this. Eating sweets together, and excitedly shopping. It's true that it does seem like you two are having lots of fun, but...  
**Tsugumi:** It also seems as if nothing has changed from when the three of us were going around together before. Can you really call this an example of a date...?  
**Mihono:** You're right. It was a lot of fun, but if I had to say either way, this isn't any different from everyone hanging out together, is it-?  
**Tsugumi:** Yamashiro-san, is it really fine to classify this under the definition of a date?  
**Yui:** Uuu\~, when you put it like that, I'm losing confidence. Could I have a little time to think this over?  
**Yui:** Get ahold of yourself, Yui. Remember the strongest Chinatown fantasy date plan you fantasized about over and over day after day. Chinatown... Chinatown... When I think of an ideal date in Chinatown, it's gotta be...  

## [China - Yui: End]: A Practice Run\!\? Yui's Fantasy Chinatown Date\!
**Yui:** Chinatown date... Chinatown date... When I think of situations for the Chinatown date I've been dreaming of, there's...  
**Yui:** That'll do\~\!\!\!\!\!  
**Mihono:** You look like a lightbulb went off in your head, Yui.  
**Tsugumi:** She does. And, it's somewhat unsettling...  
**Yui:** Anyway, let's get back into it, and swap partners\! I'll need you to be play my girlfriend now, Tsugumi-san\!  
**Tsugumi:** (Sigh, of course it would come to this. Though, I was the one who asked what a date was to start, so I can't back out now, can I...)  
**Tsugumi:** Understood. Then, please go easy on me.  
**Yui:** Just leave that to me\! Anyway, let's start right off by holding hands\! [squeeze\~]. Woww, Tsugumi-san, your hands are so soft and warm\~\!  
**Tsugumi:** Y-Yamashiro-san\! What are you doing? You got too close all of a sudden\!  
**Yui:** See, I remembered. When you think of a date, it means the two of you are closer than friends\! That means, the two of us need to have a closeness deeper than friendship.  
**Tsugumi:** Deeper than friendship... Is that so.  
**Yui:** That's right\! For example, if, while everyone's watching, I gave you a deep kiss\!  
**Yui:** And then, and then, if I took you someplace where no one's around, like a park or back alley, and when it's just the two of us, we... Ehehe... Ehehe...  
**Tsugumi:** I-Is that what it means...  I think I understand the gist of it now, so don't you think we can end our fake date here?  
**Mihono:** Y-Yeah. I think so too... The sun's going to go down soon too, so why don't we head home for today...  
**Yui:** Ehh-, just hang on\! We were only just getting started-\!  
**Yui:** Uuuu... Just when it was looking like we were going to get into the juicy stuff; I'm such an idiot\! I should have way more stuff in my stock of fantasies that'll make girl's hearts pound-\!  
**Yui:** Ah-\! I know\! I have the strongest Chinatown date plan in history here\! Hey, you two-, wait for me-\!  
**Yui:** I thought up the strongest Chinatown date plan\! So please\! Will you at least hear me walk you through it? If this doesn't make your hearts throb, then I'll take this as my loss\!  
**Tsugumi:** We weren't competing to see if you won or lost in the first place... But, if you're that adamant about it, we can at least hear you out.  
**Mihono:** Yeah. It's fine if you're only going to talk... And plus, I'm a little curious what the strongest date plan is like\!  
**Yui:** Thanks so much, you two\! It's that kind side of you that I love so much\! Anyway, I'll get right to my presentation\!  
**Yui:** Our date starts off at a China dress shop in Chinatown\! We put on matching dresses, and head out on the town\!  
**Tsugumi:** Matching China dresses... We're sticking to the assumption that this is a same sex female couple then...  
**Mihono:** Still, this sounds exciting\! You'd be happy to wear a cute dress, wouldn't you\!  
**Yui:** Right? So then, we eat some tasty food in Chinatown, and have a good time going around to all the cute general stores...  
**Mihono:** That'd be fun\~\! But...  
**Tsugumi:** Things have gone back to playing out exactly the same as before, haven't they...  
**Yui:** Hold your horses-\! The main event starts right here\!  
**Yui:** While the two of us are having a good time on our date, a group of burly thugs shows up and surrounds us, then tells you this:  
**Yui:** "Hey, pretty little thing, want to come have a good time with us..."  
**Yui:** That's when the thugs try to take you away by force. But then, I shout, "Get your hands off my girlfriend-\!\" and give the guys a high kick while I'm still in my China dress\!  
**Yui:** To protect the girl I love, I start pumping out stylish moves, taking down the punks one after another. And, completely captivated by me, my girlfriend says:  
**Yui:** "Thank you\! I owe you my life. To make it up to you... You. Can. Have. Me..."  
**Yui:** Kyaa-\! Y'know, you're a lot bolder than I thought... But, what kind of woman turns down a woman's advances\! Now's not the time to hold ourselves back\! And then, the two of us spend our sweet time together... Eheheheh...  
**Yui:** So, what do you think? Don't you want to go on a date like that?  
**Mihono:** Ummm... I want to wear a China dress, but... Everything after that is a little...  
**Tsugumi:** To begin with, it's hard to imagine such a convenient group of thugs would appear at such convenient timing...  
**Yui:** Come onnn... But I came up with the strongest, most exciting Chinatown fantasy date plan in history...  
**Yui:** Wawah, Yui's all depressed now...  
**Tsugumi:** If we were to leave her like this, it would weigh on our conscience, wouldn't it. We have to come up with something to support her...  
**Mihono:** Yui, I think everybody has their own different kind of date they dream about, but I got to have a lot of fun today because you were with us\! So thanks.  
**Tsugumi:** That's right. And, I was able to mostly understand what the definition of a date is too...  
**Yui:** You mean it\!\? I'm so glad\~\! I should be the one thanking you two\! Getting to go on a three girl date through Chinatown made me the happiest girl in the world\!  
**Tsugumi:** A three girl date...? Can you really call an outing with three people a date? Sigh... I'm understanding the definition less and less.
