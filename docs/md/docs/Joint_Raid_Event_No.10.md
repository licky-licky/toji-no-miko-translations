Joint Raid Event #10
====================

## 1: First Mission With Hirona
**Mirja:** I'm sure you'll be managing more here, but if anything troubles you, please don't hesitate to let us know, Nitta Hirona\.  
**Hirona:** Thank you\.\.\. for your consideration\. For now, there isn't anything\.\.\. Though, I have some concerns about the special duties of the investigation team\.  
**Mihono:** It'll probably take a little getting used to, but, besides collecting Akabane swords, we do normal toji work\. So you don't have to worry about it too much\.  
**Chie:** And a lot of the time, suppressing aradama is part of collecting Akabane swords, so as long as you stay focused like you would on your normal missions, you won't have any problems\.  
**Hirona:** I see-\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** Um\.\.\. Chie-san, it's about time\.  
**Chie:** You're right\. Okay, Mihono-chan\. I'm leaving the rest to you\. We have to hurry and get ready\.  
**Mihono:** Ah, sure\! You can count on me\!  
**Kiyoka:** \.\.\.Make sure she doesn't find out, okay\? (whispered\)  
**Hirona:** \? Is everyone doing something now\?  
**Mihono:** Ah-- Nah, you don't have to worry about it, Nitta-san\! Uhh, yeah\.\.\.\! Cause, you just got here yesterday\!  
**Hirona:** But\.\.\. I am a member of the investigation team too\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** (Wh-What should I say\.\.\. We want to keep it a secret until the last minute, cause it's her welcoming party and all, so there's no way I can let her help them set it up\!\)  
**Mihono:** It's like, uh\.\.\. We don't have a mission\?  
**Mirja:** No, just now, we've received an urgent mission request\.  
**Mihono:** Eh\!\?  
**Kofuki:** Now we're talking; quit wasting time\.  
**Mirja:** We'll go now to suppress the aradama\! --Investigation team, move out\!  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Hirona:** Then\.\.\. I'll have to make sure of it first\. (muttered\)  
**Yui:** Hirona-chaaan, are you coming-\?  
**Hirona:** Sorryy\.\.\. I'll be right theere\.  
**Mihono:** Kiyoka, can you finish it off\!  
**Kiyoka:** Okay\! There--\!  
**Mirja:** Musumi Kiyoka, continue providing cover for Yamashiro Yui and the others\. Asakura Mihono and Nitta Hirona will support Shichinosato Kofuki\. Shichinosato Kofuki\! Don't push too far ahead; wait for those two before attacking\!  
**Kofuki:** I can handle this much on my own\! Mihocchi's one thing, but this newbie's slow as hell\.\.\. Like I'd wait for her\!  
**Mihono:** You always come out and say that stuff, Fukki\! It's rude\! Don't let it get to you, Nitta-san--  
**Aradama:** GGGGIIIiii\!  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.\!\? --WATCH OUT\!  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\!  
**Aradama:** GGGGIIIiii\!  

## 2: The Investigation Team's New Asset
**Mihono:** I'm not letting you hurt her--\! HAAAAAAAHH\!\!  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\!  
**Mihono:** Are you okay\!\? Hirona\!  
**Mirja:** Nitta Hirona, can you continue fighting on this mission\?  
**Hirona:** Yes\.\.\. That's not an issue\. It seems I had some\.\.\. unusual nervousness, but I can do it\.  
**Aradama:** GGGGIIIiii\!  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.HAAH\!  
**Aradama:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** Beautifully done\. I see\.\.\. So your okatana can be used for more than simply thrusting\. This expands our available tactics\.  
**Hirona:** Right\.\.\. So, please give me instructionns\.  
**Mirja:** I'll take care of covering for Shichinosato Kofuki\. Nitta Hirona, you and Asakura Mihono will operate as a pair to handle the remaining small scale aradama\.  
**Mihono/Hirona:** Got it\!/\.\.\.Understood\.  
**Chie:** Good work, everyone\. That's our job here done\. It might not be so easy for us to work together at first, but let's keep at it, Nitta-san\.  
**Hirona:** The investigation team coordinates surprisingly well\. Even without clear signals, everyone moves so naturally\.\.\.  
**Yui:** We do have the cool and sexy Mirja-san commanding us\! And the investigation team goes on tons of missions together\!  
**Yui:** Besides, you're part of the team now too\. So, let's get to know each other really well so we get coordinated, Hirona-chan\!  
**Hirona:** Okay\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** Uhh, um\.\.\. You don't have to go along with Yui-chan until you're used to dealing with her\.  
**Yui:** Don't be like that-, Kiyoka-chaaan\. You know I love you too-\.  
**Mihono:** You're really strong, Hirona\! I panicked after that aradama came after you before, but you're like super fast\!  
**Hirona:** I'm not that great\.\.\. When you saved me from that aradama, you seemed so much stronger to me\. I can't explain it well though\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** No way; you were all like\.\.\. Whoosh woosh woosh\! And it was so cool how you moved your sword, Hirona\!  
**Mihono:** Ah\. I just started calling you Hirona; are you okay with that\? We're in the same grade, so you should just call me Mihono too\!  
**Hirona:** Go ahead\.\.\. Then\.\.\. I'll call you Asakura-san\.  
**Mihono:** Don't you mean Mihono\!\? Well, you can say whatever's easier for you-\.  
**Chie:** I was a little worried at first, but it looks like things should be fine\.  
**Mirja:** I know\. I'm glad to see it\. The team can operate even more safely now\.  
**Kofuki:** This sucks\.\.\. I'm gonna get even less aradama-chan to pick from now\.  
**Mirja:** Considering the skills she's shown, that's likely the case\.  
**Kofuki:** But, that doesn't mean I'm giving any up without a fight\!  
**Chie:** Okay, when we get back, how about we give Hirona-chan her welcoming party\?  
**Kiyoka/Mihono/Yui:** Yeah-\!  

## 3: Nitta Hirona's Reasons
**Hirona:** Thank you\.\.\. for going this far for me\.  
**Chie:** We'd actually been meaning to cook something up to welcome you, but we couldn't find the time\. Though, the cakes here are delicious, aren't they\?  
**Hirona:** Yes\.\.\. They are\. I do like sweets a lot\. Moving your body and using your head requires sugar\.\.\. so it's very cost efficient\.  
**Kofuki:** That's just normal\. It'd be weirder if you were like somebody who doesn't care what stuff tastes like as long as it's got nutrition\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\? Do you know someone like that\? You can't not eat food, so\.\.\. I think it's better for it to taste good\.  
**Mihono:** That's for sure\. This cake's yummy, but I wish we could've eaten Chii-nee's cooking too\.\.\. She's a really good cook\~\.  
**Hirona:** Is she-\? My senpai is great at cooking too-\.  
**Hirona:** Of course, I would like to try Setouchi-san's cooking too\.\.\. someday\.  
**Chie:** It doesn't have to be someday; we can do it soon\. Do you cook, Nitta-san\?  
**Hirona:** If I use a microwave or rice cooker\.\.\. I can cook some things\. There's lots of recipes you can use a rice cooker for nowadayys\.\.\.  
**Hirona:** But\.\.\. I've been eating out and getting food from convenience stores more lately\. If you think about the time required, it's very efficient\.\.\.  
**Chie:** If you want to eat healthy, it's better to cook for yourself, but we do get lots of missions, don't we\.  
**Mirja:** Come to think of it, have the two of you ever met at Osafune, or been assigned on the same mission\?  
**Chie:** I don't think we have\. Have we\?  
**Hirona:** No\.\.\. I don't think I've ever been in the same team as Setouchi-san\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** Speaking of Osafune, that uniform\.\.\. Nitta-san\.\.\. it suits you really well\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.You think so\? I can't really tell\.\.\. But, since having a uniform means I don't need to think about what to wear, I like having onee\. So much that I sometimes wear it on days off too\.  
**Hirona:** In a way\.\.\. uniforms are the most powerful clothes\.  
**Kiyoka:** Uniforms are cute, but that's such a waste\! You should come try on clothes with us sometime, Nitta-san\.  
**Hirona:** Still\.\.\. I can order online\.  
**Kiyoka:** It's so much better buying clothes in person though\! And it's really fun\!  
**Mihono:** Let's go do it\!  
**Hirona:** Alright thenn\.\.\.  
**Hirona:** (With personal relationships\.\.\. slow and steady is best\.\.\. and this is the investigation team\.\.\.\)  
**Yui:** Mmm\~, I can't wait-\! It doesn't get better than having more cuties around\!  
Several hours later--

  
**Yuuki:** Yuuki here\. How's everything going over there\? Please give your report\.  
**Hirona:** Thenn\.\.\. to start with\.\.\. there's a very high chance Asakura-san's power is what Makoto-san thinks\. And also\.\.\. everyone on the investigation team are good people\.  
**Yuuki:** Hm, okay\. I got it\. I'll make sure to let Makoto-nee-sama know\.  
**Hirona:** I'm a little surprised\.\.\.  
**Yuuki:** \? By what\?  
**Hirona:** I thought I'd be giving my report to Akira-san\.  
**Yuuki:** Oh, Akira-nee-sama said this was practice making contact and getting reports\. Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you\. She said, \"Don't stand out too much\.\"  
**Hirona:** Okaay, keeping quiet is what I'm good at\.\.\. Hurray for energy efficiency\.  
**Yuuki:** Alright then; do your best out there, Hirona-san\! Akira-nee-sama and Makoto-nee-sama have high hopes for you\!  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.What about you, Yuuki-saan\?  
**Yuuki:** Well, sure I am\. If I had to put it like Akira-nee-sama, it's hardcore\. I have hardcore hopes for you\!  
**Hirona:** Hardcore-\? Fufu\.\.\.\.\.\. I'll try my beest\.  
**Yuuki:** If anything else comes up, let us know, okay\? I'm about to go to bed\.\.\. [yawn\]\.  
**Hirona:** Okaay, goodniight\.
