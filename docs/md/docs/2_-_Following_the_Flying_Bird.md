## 1: Chasing After Kanami (1)
**Suzuka:** Capture the ones who attacked Yukari-sama\! Do not let them escape\!  
**Suzuka's Underlings:** Understood\!  
**Friend B:** Wha\!\? What was that\! What's going on\!\?  
**Mihono:** Just what it looked like, I think. That girl from Heijou, Juujou Hiyori, attacked Yukari-sama, and Kanami saved her.  
**Mihono:** But I don't get it... But...  
**Friend B:** What? So what, Kanami and that black haired girl were working together\!\?  
**Mihono:** There's no way\! Kanami wouldn't... She had no reason to attack Yukari-sama\! ...I'm going\!  
**Friend B:** Wait, where\!\?  
**Chie:** You're kidding me\!\? Mihono-chan\!  
**Chie:** (Don't tell me she's going after Etou-san? ...I can't let that happen\! I have to get over there and stop her\!)  
**Chie:** I made it\! Stop, Mihono-chan\! You can't do this\!  
**Mihono:** Chii-nee\!\? But I have to talk to Kanami\!  
**Chie:** I'm trying to tell you...\!  
**Bodyguard Toji:** You two, stop right there\! All students have been ordered not to leave the area\!  
**Chie:** I'm too late\!\?  
**Mihono:** Security\!\? I-I'm not going to stop\!  
**Mihono:** (I can't let them stop me here\! I'll... I'll use jin'i to break through\!)  
**Chie:** Mihono-chan\! I told you not to run\! You're just making things more complicated\!  
**Chie:** (I don't have a choice... I'll follow her with jin'i\!)  
**Mihono:** Pant... Pant... Sorry, Chii-nee... But I can't let them stop me yet. I have to hear from Kanami... Why she did this\!  
**Chie:** Mihono-chan\! It doesn't matter what you want; we won't get away with this that easily\! Not those girls or us\!  
**Bodyguard Toji:** Oi\! I told you to stop\! If you keep resisting, I'll have to restrain you as traitors\!  
**Mihono:** They already caught up\!\? Guess I can't lose Origami security that easy... But still\! Alright\! Where there's a will... There's a way\!  
**Chie:** Aghh, I can't believe you\! There's nothing I can do\!  

## 2: Chasing After Kanami (2)
**Bodyguard Toji:** You... No matter how you look at it... This is treason, you know\!  
**Mihono:** Uh, I'm really sorry\! I only used the blunt of the blade, so please forgive me\! As soon as I hear why Kanami did that, I'll bring her right back, okay\!  
**Mihono:** So, I'm going\!  

## 3: Because I Trust Her\! (1)
**Mihono:** Pant... Pant... Which way did they go... Pant...  
**Chie:** Pant... Pant... Mihono-chan... Why... Pant... Are you going this far... For that girl?  
**Mihono:** Kanami's innocent... I know she is. After all, before we came here, she promised me...  
**Kanami:** And when I get back, let's have another match\! Fighting you in the semi-finals... It was really exciting\!  
**Mihono:** ......Nn\!\? S-Stop, you're making me blush...\! Okay, fine\! We'll have a rematch; that's a promise\!  
**Kanami:** Yeah\! I promise\!  
**Mihono:** She promised me, we'd fight again.  
**Mihono:** And, of all her friends at the tournament, I think I'm the only one with an okatana right now... So I'm the only one that can back her up here.  
**Chie:** ...I see. Mm, I get it. Alright then, your onee-san will go with you.  
**Mihono:** Chii-nee\! Thank you\!  
**Chie:** You weren't going to listen to me anyway; you always used to be like this. Besides, "where there's a will, there's a way", right?  
*Chie draws her sword*

  
**Chie:** Now then, so we don't get stopped here, let's hurry and break through them, okay?  
**Bodyguard Toji:** I caught up again\! Now, don't resist...  
**Chie:** Hate to break it to you, but we plan on resisting.  
**Mihono:** (Eh\!\? Chii-nee...\!\?)  
**Chie:** But isn't that fine? After all, the two of us are going after Etou Kanami and Juujou Hiyori to safely bring them back. We're not the ones you're after, isn't that right?  
**Bodyguard Toji:** Uh... You're not wrong, but... Ah, hey, that's faulty logic\! You're not gonna trick me like that\! Everybody\! Come on, get them-\!  
**Chie:** Ah, you saw through it\~. Then you leave us other choice, right? Mihono-chan, I'll follow you right on through\!  

## 4: Because I Trust Her\! (2)
**Bodyguard Toji:** Ughh... I'm beat...  
**Mihono:** Remember this, Mihono. When Chii-nee gets serious, she's scary...  
**Chie:** Now, Mihono-chan\! Let's hurry\!  
**Mihono:** I-I'm going\!  

## 5: The Little Bird Breaks Through the Cage
**Mihono:** Kanami\! I really found you...\!  
**Kanami:** M-Mihono-chan\!\? Why are you here...?  
**Mihono:** Why... Everything's a mess back there\! That's why... Why did you do that?  
**Mihono:** Helping the girl who turned her okatana on Yukari-sama... That makes you a traitor too, you know\! And who is that girl...\!\?  
**Mihono:** (......That's not it\! That's not what I meant to say...)  
**Chie:** Etou-san, listen\! Mihono-chan thinks you're innocent\!  
**Chie:** She just wants to hear the truth from you\! No matter what happens, she's on your side\!  
**Mihono:** (Ah...\! Thanks for setting it straight, Chii-nee\!)  
**Kanami:** ...Oh.  
**Mihono:** Yeah\! Please, just give me the reason\! Yanase-san and everyone who came to cheer you on will want to help too\!  
**Mihono:** That's why, see? If there's anything we can do to help...  
**Kanami:** ...\! Hang on...  
**Kanami:** Mihono-chan, did you... Have to fight anyone on your way here?  
**Mihono:** ......  
**Kanami:** ...You did. It felt like there weren't many coming after us... So you were distracting them.  
**Kanami:** I'm so sorry. I got you caught up in this.  
**Hiyori:** Are we done here? I'm leaving.  
**Chie:** Ah\! Stop right there\!  
*Kanami blocks Chie*

  
**Chie:** Etou Kanami-san\! Why are you stopping me\! That girl is getting away\!  
**Kanami:** I'm sorry, but, I can't let you stop her\! That girl must have a reason for this\! There's a good reason for all of this, I know it\!  
**Kanami:** After all, I saw it...  
**Mihono:** Saw it? What?  
**Kanami:** Back then... Behind Yukari-sama...  
**Kanami:** ...No, forget it. Just know that, right now... I won't let you stop her\!  

## 6: Understanding Through Joining Blades (1)
**Mihono:** Kanami\! I'm begging you, put your okatana away\!  
**Kanami:** Please, Mihono-chan\! Just let the girl with Kogarasumaru, let Juujou-san escape\!  
**Mihono:** ...Fine. I'll let her leave, okay. But then, please, you have to come back with me\!  
**Kanami:** I can't do that\!  
**Mihono:** You can't... Then what\!\? What about the rematch you promised\!\? Is this what you meant\!\? Because I can't stand this\!  
**Kanami:** I know\! We can have our rematch again later. I promise\!  
**Mihono:** But, Kanami, if you leave now...\!  
**Chie:** \!\?  
**Chie:** Mihono-chan\! Etou-san\! Juujou-san\! ...Behind us\!  
*aradama appears*

  
**Mihono:** Eh\!\?  
**Kanami:** Aradama\!\? How\!\? We're right in the middle of Kamakura...  
**Mihono:** (These small aradama... They're the same as the ones we fought before...\!\? Did we miss some\!\?)  
**Mihono:** Chii-nee\! Kanami\! We have to stop them before they hurt anybody\!  
**Kanami:** ...Okay\! I'll help\!  

## 7: Understanding Through Joining Blades (2)
**Chie:** This is as much as we can contain the noro, so it'll have to wait until the recovery team arrives. We've done all we can here.  
**Chie:** Good work, everyone.  
**Mihono:** I'm glad no one got hurt. Thanks, Kanami and Juujou-san. You really helped out.  
**Mihono:** Huh? Kanami?  
**Chie:** They already left. Kanami bowed on her way, as if to say she's sorry.  
**Mihono:** Oh... While I was... Busy with the noro, they must have left.  
**Mihono:** (Kanami... Why didn't you say anything...)  
**Chie:** But that's a relief, isn't it, Mihono-chan?  
**Mihono:** Eh? Relief? What is...?  
**Chie:** Now you know Etou-san isn't a bad person. She helped stop the aradama, and she wanted to keep your promise.  
**Chie:** You can believe in her now, at least, can't you?  
**Mihono:** Chii-nee... Yeah... Yeah, you're right.  

## 8: Because I Trusted Her\! (1)
**Chie:** So let's go back, Mihono-chan. You got to know some of how Etou-san was feeling. We'll just have to leave the rest to the Yukari family.  
**Mihono:** Okay... You're right. This is all we can do here... All we can do. Sigh, I'm really feeling powerless here...  
**Chie:** Don't worry about it. The two of us can wait until Etou-san finds out Juujou-san's motive and makes it back home.  
**Mihono:** Okay, I can do that. Thanks, Chii-nee.  
**Chie:** Fufu. Ah, that reminds me.  
**Chie:** You still have that old bad habit of yours, huh? When you lost concentration, you started spacing out.  
**Chie:** You always got scolded for it back in the dojo, remember?  
**Mihono:** Ugh... I-I'm always fine at the start. I always know what kind of techniques to use, and if there's something I haven't seen before, it's always like, FLASH\! and I figure it out.  
**Mihono:** But there's always a point where it runs out. I was doing fine against Kanami in the semi-finals until then. Why me...?  
**???:** Oi, you two\!  
**Maki:** We're after the two traitors who turned their blades on Yukari-sama\! Do you know which way they went?  
**Suzuka:** ...Wait a moment, Maki-san. I believe these two are the ones who attacked my subordinates and fled.  
**Suzuka:** Ordinarily, this is where we would take you in for questioning, but... That won't be enough to settle what you've done.  
**Maki:** Ahh, in that case, why not teach them a lesson first? We can drag them back after we're done.  
**Maki:** Try putting up the best resistance you can, you two. We'll have plenty of time to talk later.  

## 9: Because I Trusted Her\! (2)
**Mihono:** D-Did we beat them...?  
**Suzuka:** You can't figure that out? You've lost.  
**Mihono:** Kgh\!   
*Mihono is cut and falls*

  
**Chie:** Mihono-chan\!  
**Chie:** Agh\!  
*same happens to Chie*

  
**Maki:** ...This is the end, you two.  
**Maki:** Now then... Osafune's Setouchi Chie. You're quite skilled, really. That was a good fight... However, you.  
**Mihono:** Ugh... Gh...  
**Maki:** You're worthless. A total weakling. At first you showed promise, and I had the feeling you had been hiding some real strength. I let myself get excited, but...  
**Maki:** Utterly worthless, in the end.  
**Maki:** Before I knew it you fell apart, and that skill you first showed grew slow and weak. Like that broken okatana of yours, you come up entirely too short.  
**Maki:** That's enough, I suppose. By anyone's measure, this is the end. Oi, guards, go ahead and take them away.  
**Maki's Underling:** Understood\!  

## 10: Osafune's Thoughts/Ayanokouji's Thoughts
The same day...

  
Origami family office--

  
**Yukari:** I see... I was wondering why, on the day of the tournament, you would request a direct line of communication with me. So this is it.  
**Sana:** Yes, Director. It's about the unresolved issue the "Akabane swords" have presented us for over a decade now...  
**Sana:** I would like to request permission to set up an investigation office, and compose an investigation team for dealing with it.  
**Sana:** In regards to the Akabane swords, our lack of information has forced us into a stalemate. For a long time, humanity has been stalled like this, and I believe now is a good time to take action.  
**Yukari:** "Humanity has been stalled", hm? What interesting phrasing. I was under the impression that the Five Traditions agreed it was a natural phenomenon. Did you not agree with that?  
**Yukari:** It's almost as if you're suggesting someone is intentionally acting against us, Osafune President.  
**Sana:** I'm simply asking you to take into account that possibility.  
**Sana:** The current belief is that these okatana sunk in the ocean attract noro and act as the core for a newborn aradama. The idea is sound, however...  
**Sana:** Considering the lack of a reason as to why these okatana are rusting, nor the reason why the outbreak of these aradama has been so widespread, we have not yet been able to form a reasonable explanation tying together all elements of this phenomenon.  
**Sana:** Certainly it's a scientific process that's allowed us to come to our current dealing with the situation, however, this is nothing more than a makeshift solution. We have no means of permanently ending the problem.  
**Yukari:** I see. A permanent solution? Very well. Osafune president, you have my permission.  
**Yukari:** I expect great results.  
*phone hangs up*

  

## 30 minutes later...
Kyoto prefecture, Ayanokouji Martial Arts School, President's office--

  
**Yuzuki:** I see. So you want to assemble a mixed unit with students from all the Five Traditions. ...A reasonable proposal, but I think you're hiding your real intentions, President Maniwa.  
**Yuzuki:** For example, a reason you can't pursue at any time besides right now.  
**Sana:** You mean like the owners of Kogarasumaru and Chidori attacking the director? Don't be ridiculous, that's pure coincidence.  
**Yuzuki:** Well, it doesn't matter. At any rate, my school will provide you with a toji.  
**Yuzuki:** And, after this, I'll indirectly propose the idea to Renpu's president for you.  
**Yuzuki:** If she believes she'll win the director's favor through it, she'll jump at the opportunity no questions asked.  
**Sana:** That'd really help. If I were the one to propose it to her, I can already hear her saying "Why does the likes of you think she gets to speak on Yukari-sama's behalf\!\?"  
**Sana:** She's a real handful.  
**Yuzuki:** I don't think her reaction will be any different if I'm the one to say it... That said, you're right that she'd be worse if it came straight from you.  
**Yuzuki:** So then, what about Minoseki and Heijou's presidents?  
**Yuzuki:** After the aforementioned incident with their Etou Kanami and Juujou Hiyori, the two have gone in to Kamakura for questioning.  
**Sana:** It's a good opportunity, so I'll be the one to ask them. I haven't heard from them in a while either, so it'd be a nice chance to catch up.  
**Sana:** ...With that, I'll talk to you later.  
**Yuzuki:** Right.  
*phone hangs up*

  

## 15 minutes later...
**Mirja:** Ayanokouji Martial Arts School, high school 2nd year... Kitora Mirja, reporting in.  
**Yuzuki:** Enter.  
**Mirja:** Excuse me.  
**Yuzuki:** I'm glad you're here, Mirja. The details are as I sent to you: an investigation into the Akabane swords. For this, I'll need you to depart to Kamakura at once.  
**Yuzuki:** For the time being, you'll be removed from your position as a captain of the Special Ritual Riot Squad, and be working under the supervision of the five presidents. I trust you don't have a problem with that?  
**Mirja:** No.  
**Yuzuki:** And, one more thing. While on this investigation... There's something I want you to locate.  
**Yuzuki:** You are to search for, locate, and return to me an okatana. Its inscription reads: "Namu Yakushi Rurikou Nyorai Kagemitsu".  
**Yuzuki:** An okatana long lost, in the distant past...
