## [Ceremonial Dress - Misogi: Start]: Isolation
**Hiyori:** (When did this start, I wonder? When I became conscious of my loneliness.)  
**Hiyori:** (At the very least, I didn't used to be like this. Because, back then, all I could ever think of was getting stronger.)  
**Hiyori:** To take the duty my mother left behind into my own hands...  
**Himeno Shiho:** Ah, heyyy\! Juujou-saaan\! Wait up-\!  
**Hiyori:** Nn? You're...  
**Shiho:** Himeno Shiho; we're in the same grade. Let's get along.  
**Hiyori:** ...Right.  
**Shiho:** So hey, you're strong aren't you, Juujou-san? You really surprised me.  
**Hiyori:** ...I guess. Did you want something?  
**Shiho:** Ah, that's right.  
**Shiho:** My skills with a sword are still nowhere near that good. So, if it's alright with you, I was wondering if you could teach me some things later?  
**Shiho:** I mean, just if you have some free time.  
**Hiyori:** ...Sorry, but there's something I have to do.  
**Shiho:** Oh, okay... Hmm, that's too bad.  
**Shiho:** Hey, there's Chinami\! Heyyy, want to do some practice together now-?  
**Kamo Chinami:** Mm, okay\! Now's perfect; I was just thinking of practicing not getting my hair and clothes so disheveled while I'm fighting.  
**Shiho:** Cool\! Then, I'll talk to you later, Juujou-san\!  
**Hiyori:** Practicing together, huh...  
**Hiyori:** ...Well, I should get going now.  
**Hiyori:** HMPH, HAA, YAAA, HAA\!  
**Hiyori:** (The only thing I thought about then was growing stronger.)  
**Hiyori:** HAAAA, HAA\! SEI, YAA, HAA, HAAA, YAA\!  
**Hiyori:** (I distanced myself from others as best as I could, and lived only to polish my own skills.)  
**Hiyori:** I have to be faster, sharper, stronger...\!  
**Hiyori:** (I had to be the one to carry out what my mother failed to finish. And so I was always alone. Still, I never once felt lonely.)  
**Hiyori:** HAAAAAAA, HAA\!\!  
**Hiyori:** Pant... Pant... Pant... Kh, is that all it takes for me to lose my breath...\!  
**Hiyori:** I can keep going...\! I'm not done here yet...\!  
**Hiyori:** (That's right... Until I met Kanami and the others, and began spending time with them...)

## [Ceremonial Dress - Misogi: End]: Growth
**Hiyori:** (It was after I met Kanami and the others that, before I knew it, it had become unusual for me to be alone.)  
**Hiyori:** (So is that the reason? Why, when I'm by myself, I started feeling my loneliness.)  
**Hiyori:** (After feeling that, I wanted to ask myself.)  
**Hiyori:** (Have I gotten weaker than I used to be...?\)  
**Aradama:** KWAAAAAAA-\!\!\!  
**Hiyori:** Urgh...\!  
**Hiyori:** Pant, pant... Damnit... Is this how it ends up as soon as I want some time to think on my own...  
**Hiyori:** Still... I didn't expect this swarm of aradama to show up here...  
**Aradama:** GRRRRUUU...\!  
**Hiyori:** (Here they come...\!\)  
**???:** No you don't-\! YAAAA\!  
**Aradama:** GAAA,aaaa...  
**Kanami:** Are you okay, Hiyori-chan\!\?  
**Hiyori:** K-Kanami...?  
**Mai:** And she's not the only one who came to help.  
**Hiyori:** Mai, and the rest of you too...?  
**Ellen:** You should be thanking Nene, Hiyoyon. Nene was the one who noticed the aradama and led us here\!  
**Nene:** Nene-\!  
**Kanami:** Look, everybody\! That one there should be the boss aradama\!  
**Aradama:** GGGGAAAAAAAAA-\!\!  
**Sayaka:** Mai, give us orders.  
**Mai:** Right, okay. Everyone, deal with the nearby aradama. Kanami-chan, do you think you can hold off the boss for a while? While you do that, I'll take Hiyori-chan to safety.  
**Kanami:** Sure, I'm on it, Mai-chan\! YAAAAAAA\!  
**Ellen:** We should go too, Kaoru\!  
**Kaoru:** Not like we have a say in it.  
**Mai:** Alright, you come with me, Hiyori-chan.  
**Hiyori:** (But, I can't just leave everyone else behind...\!\)  
**Hiyori:** Mai, I'm going to stand and fight too.  
**Mai:** Eh? But, you're hurt...?  
**Hiyori:** This is nothing. Besides, we can't leave Kanami to fight that boss aradama by herself.  
**Hiyori:** Let's go, Mai. We'll all sweep through the aradama at once. HAAAAAA\!  
**Hiyori:** (In a sense, maybe I have gotten weaker. Since I met Kanami, I came to realize my own loneliness; how weak I am on my own.)  
**Hiyori:** (Even so, being able to fight side by side with others like I am now, I'm sure I can accomplish things I couldn't before.)  
**Hiyori:** (In that case, this strength is enough.)  
**Hiyori:** (With this, I won't regret these days I spend with Kanami and the rest. No matter what may come, I won't regret it.)

## [Nurse - Chie: Start]: I'm Worried After All
**Mihono:** You're going to be in a practical exercise for medical courses?  
**Chie:** That's right. It's part of a lecture I took that sounded interesting. Which is why I won't be there for the investigation team on the day of the exercise.  
**Mirja:** I understand.  
**Mirja:** Everyone's shown considerable growth lately. Even not having you with us, there shouldn't be any problems.  
**Chie:** ...I'm glad to hear it.  
**Chie:** (That gives me some relief, but... it makes me a little lonely too.)  
**Kiyoka:** What is it you'll be doing for a practical exercise in a medical course?  
**Chie:** It looks like we'll be acting as nurses.  
**Yui:** Are you serious\!\?  
**Yui:** Ah, I wanna see. I wanna see it so bad. Chie-san as a nurse; she'd be a real angel in white\!  
**Kofuki:** Huh? Like Chichie could ever cut it as an angel.  
**Chie:** ...  
**Kofuki:** She's more like a demon\! A demon in white\!  
**Kofuki:** You've never seen Chichie get pissed for real before. You can totally see horns and everything.  
**Chie:** Fufu, Kofuki-chan? Don't you think that might be the fault of the one making me upset?  
**Kofuki:** See, look at her\! She's freaky as hell, right\!  
**Chie:** Kofuki-chan? Get on your knees.  
**Yui:** Look, that's what you get for making Chie-san angry.  
**Kiyoka:** Yui-chan's completely right, Kofuki-san.  
**Yui:** Forgetting about Kofuki-san, we all think you'd look great in it. Chie-san in her nurse cosplay\!  
**Chie:** ...  
**Mihono:** Cosplay?  
**Yui:** Yeah, Mihono-chan\!  
**Yui:** Must be so nice, Chie-san in nurse cosplay\! I want her to nurse me gently inside and out\!  
**Chie:** Yui-chan?  
**Yui:** Yes, Chie-san\!  
**Chie:** On your knees.  
**Yui:** Why me too\!\?  
**Chie:** Honestly now.  
**Chie:** Mirja, I'm sure it won't be easy on you, but do your best looking after them.  
**Mirja:** ...I know, I will.

## [Nurse - Chie: End]: It's Alright
**Sakura:** ...I'm Hamatsuka Sakura, from the medical department. I'm glad to be working with you today.  
**Chie:** And I am too, Hamatsuka-san. I'm Setouchi Chie.  
**Chie:** It's nice to meet you... Though, this isn't the first time we've met, is it?  
**Sakura:** Yes. I've seen you sometimes, at Ban-san's lab.  
**Sakura:** Though, this is the first time we've had an actual conversation.  
**Chie:** That's right.  
**Chie:** As soon as you're done treating us, you always leave right away, Hamatsuka-san.  
**Sakura:** ...I'm sorry.  
**Chie:** Fufu, it's not anything you need to apologize for.  
**Chie:** Though, I've always thought that I wanted to talk with you, so I'm glad.  
**Chie:** No matter how small the injury, you always treat it with care, don't you, Hamatsuka-san? So I was curious what sort of girl you were.  
**Sakura:** But, I'm not that...  
**Nurse:** We're going to be starting the practical exercise soon. Please gather around-.  
**Sakura:** Ah, the exercise is starting. We should go.  
**Chie:** ...She ran away. Did I do something to make her not like me?  
**Patient A:** Thank you very much.  
**Chie:** Not at all; please take care of yourself.  
**Patient B:** Excuse me, I'd like to ask something...  
**Chie:** Yes, what do you need?  
**Sakura:** (...She's amazing. So many people are just going over to Setouchi-san...)  
**Sakura:** ...  
**Chie:** Good work, Hamatsuka-san. That was nerve-wracking, with how unfamiliar I was with everything.  
**Sakura:** You didn't seem that way at all. Um...  
**Chie:** What is it?  
**Sakura:** There's something I'm having trouble with...  
**Chie:** Mmhm?  
**Sakura:** ...No, I shouldn't be asking you after all. I can't go into much detail about it...  
**Chie:** (Was what's bothering her the reason she avoided me before?\)  
**Chie:** ...You said you're having trouble with something, but, do you know exactly what it is?  
**Sakura:** ...I do.  
**Chie:** (If I had to guess... She's avoiding getting involved with other people? But, she's trying to talk about it with me...)  
**Chie:** You'll be alright.  
**Sakura:** Eh?  
**Chie:** You're a kind and earnest girl, Hamatsuka-san. So long as you know what's causing it, I'm sure you'll get through it someday.  
**Sakura:** ...  
**Sakura:** Thank you very much. That makes me feel a little better.  
**Chie:** No, I'm the one who should be thanking you.  
**Chie:** After all, without people like you there for us, us toji wouldn't be able to keep on fighting.  
**Chie:** So... we'll keep being in your care in the future.  
**Sakura:** Okay\!
