## 1: Chocolate Panic Prologue
**Mirja:** Tsubakuro Yume, the target has been led your way\! Dispose of it\!  
**Yume:** You can get to see my good side too, glasses onee-san\! TAAA-\!  
**Yume:** Geez\~, that one wasn't even worth it\~\!  
**Yume:** Ah\! Suzuka-onee-san, look, look. Chocolate really did come out of this aradama I got.  
**Suzuka:** Just as the report said, aradama are targeting chocolate... Or at the very least, they certainly are attracted to it.  
**Suzuka:** ...But just because it's Valentines season doesn't mean even the aradama would become captivated by chocolate.  
**Mirja:** It's an odd case. Chocolate manufacturers, confectioneries, and department stores have all come under attack from aradama.  
**Mirja:** We still don't understand why the aradama are seeking out chocolate in the first place.  
**Suzuka:** But in the meantime, the least we can do is to station toji by stores and factories dealing with chocolate.ã€€  
**Mirja:** Yes, I believe you made the right decision by proposing this countermeasure.  
**Mirja:** After all, something had to be done about the public's feeling of unease. The workers in the shop were very grateful too.  
**Suzuka:** It was only the reasonable thing to do. Investigating the cause is another part of our mission. For that, I'd like to depend upon your talent for observation and analysis.  
**Mirja:** I'll do what I can to meet your expectations.  
**Yume:** You two are thinking way too hard about it\~\. All we have to do is beat up the aradama.  
**Yume:** They're all so weak anyway, so just leave it to me and we'll be finished before you know it.  
**Mirja:** You have a point. What matters most is eliminating the aradama.  
**Suzuka:** Thanks to Yume, we've cleared out the aradama here for the time being. Why don't we head on back?  
**Yume:** Hey hey, when we get back, I wanna have some cake. I can, can't I?  
**Suzuka:** If you must, but only just a little, alright?  
**Yume:** Awesome-\!  
**Mirja:** (Konohana Suzuka shows quite the soft side toward Tsubakuro Yume, doesn't she.)  
**Suzuka:** Welcome. An advance order? In that case, please fill this out.  
**Suzuka:** Very good, we have your order for a chocolate cake.  
**Yume:** So wait, why are we just working here normally again\!\?  
**Mirja:** With such frequent appearances of aradama, we would waste too much time arriving otherwise.  
**Suzuka:** And serving customers is unexpectedly entertaining, isn't it?  
**Mirja:** It's certainly a more worthwhile use of our time than idly waiting for aradama to appear.  
**Yume:** Ehh, but we could just eat cakes while we wait. The ones they have here are pretty good.  
**Suzuka:** You were greeting customers earlier though, Yume.  
**Yume:** I got bored of that. It's no fun.  
**Mirja:** However, it's a good experience. As toji, we rarely have opportunities to participate in normal customer service work.  
**Suzuka:** Welcome... Oh, it's you.  
**Ellen:** Hi\! It's your customer and also helper, Kohagura Ellen\!  
**Ellen:** You know, I never thought I'd see an ojou-sama like Hanahana serving customers like this\!  
**Mirja:** If you had to say one way or the other, would you not consider yourself an ojou-sama as well?  
**Ellen:** Mmmm, well, I'm nothing compared to someone like Maimai, right?  
**Ellen:** I don't exactly have the essence of an ojou-sama.  
**Ellen:** Now, Miss Shopkeeper, what do you recommend for me?  
**Suzuka:** Let me see... As it is the Valentines season, we have many chocolate products. However, these pear tarts do have quite the flavor.  
**Ellen:** In that case, I'll take one of those\~\.  
**Yume:** Ah, Suzuka-onee-san\! I wanna eat one too\!  
**Suzuka:** You just had that strawberry shortcake, didn't you? You'll spoil your dinner.  
**Yume:** Bleh. Fine, I'll wait till tomorrow.  
**Suzuka:** Yes, that's fine then.  
**Mirja:** (But not just soft, it seems. And Tsubakuro Yume doesn't always behave so spoiled either.)  
**Mirja:** (It's true after all, there are some sides to relationships that can't be seen until you get close.)  
**Ellen:** We get to do a different job than usual while still performing our duty as toji. It feels weird; sort of exciting, don't you think?  
**Ellen:** So let's have as much fun with it as we can\!  
**Mirja:** Yes, I'm glad to have you helping us. Let's settle this matter, along with discovering the underlying cause behind the aradama's behavior.  
**Suzuka:** As there are four of us now, why not work in two man teams from here on out? It would be more efficient that way.  
**Mirja:** I don't object to the idea.  
**Yume:** I'm fine with whatever. But I'd be fine on my own too.  
**Ellen:** Don't say that, Yumecchi. We never get a chance like this, so I want to pair up with you\!  
**Yume:** With you, Onee-san? Sure, that might be kind of fun.  

## 2: Chocolate Panic Epilogue
**Suzuka:** I won't allow any further disturbance from you--  
**Suzuka:** --HAAH-\!\!  
**Ellen:** An impressive swing\! Good job, Hanahana.  
**Suzuka:** It was nothing so remarkable. Now then, Yume, what was it this time?  
**Yume:** Just more ribbons and boxes. Haven't most of them been like this lately?  
**Suzuka:** At the start, it seemed only chocolate would come from these aradama, but we've gathered a mountain of packaging supplies by now...  
**Mirja:** Looking at it statistically, we should recognize that their goal was not chocolate itself, but materials to package chocolate.  
**Suzuka:** From the reports, it appears the factories of chocolate manufacturers have seen a steady reduction of damages.  
**Suzuka:** In their place, cases of department stores and sweets shops being attacked for their packaged chocolate gifts have risen...   
**Ellen:** But I've heard that, thanks to all the toji working so hard, the phenomenon with these aradama is going back to normal\!  
**Ellen:** Is there any truth to that, Hanahana?  
**Suzuka:** I'm very curious as to hear where you heard that, but we will indeed be returning to normal alert status starting today.  
**Suzuka:** In fact, the rate of aradama appearances has dropped to the extent that the four of us could act simultaneously even in this large shopping mall.  
**Yume:** Really? So that means, we won't get to wear those uniforms much longer. I'm a little disappointed.  
**Suzuka:** You did look very nice in it.  
**Yume:** Oh yeah, so what was with the aradama stealing packaging supplies anyway?  
**Mirja:** Unfortunately, we were never able to discern the reason behind that...  
**Ellen:** ......  
**Ellen:** What if, maybe the aradama also just wanted a gift of chocolates from someone?  
**Yume:** Ehh, but they're aradama?  
**Ellen:** Well like they say, a gift comes from the heart.  
**Ellen:** Think about it, Yumecchi. It feels good to get a present, so, if you had the chance, you'd gladly take one, right?  
**Yume:** Sure I guess...  
**Mirja:** That's a somewhat poetic viewpoint, but I suppose even aradama can be charmed by certain things.  
**Suzuka:** We can speculate all we want, but there's no clear answer. The noro has been recovered, so let's return to the shop.  
**Yume:** Thank you very much.  
**Mirja:** As soon as we've become used to dealing with customers, the time has come to leave this store.  
**Suzuka:** I know. It gave us some trouble, but it was a rather fulfilling mission; offering a valuable experience working with customers.  
**Ellen:** More than anything, I'm sad there wasn't one of those cute uniforms to wear in my size.  
**Ellen:** By the way, you had one of the workers here help teach you how to make chocolate sweets, didn't you, Hanahana?  
**Ellen:** Were you going to make a gift for somebody?  
**Suzuka:** ......  
**Suzuka:** I only saw it as an opportunity to learn from a professional... Well, it might be nice to try making someone a present.  
**Suzuka:** What about you; are you going to give someone chocolate?  
**Ellen:** I'll give some to Kaoru, of course\! The cakes here are delicious that I already made a reservation.  
**Yume:** I got a lot of chocolate too, so I think I'll share some with Yomi-onee-san. Just a little though.  
**Mirja:** Oh... A text message from someone? Please excuse me.  
**From Yamashiro Yui:** Hello, Mirja-san\!  
It's almost Valentines, you know. So why not give some chocolate to your cute kouhai who works so hard every day\!

  
Some chocolate, filled up with your love, for Valentines Day, if you please\!

  
If you feed it to me while I say ahhh, I'll swear to you my eternal loyalty, no, love\! So--

  
**Mirja:** Huh... At some point, Yamashiro Yui must have gotten my contact information...  
**Mirja:** Well, regardless... This is something that would be best to ignore.  
GIVE ME CHOCOLATE\!
