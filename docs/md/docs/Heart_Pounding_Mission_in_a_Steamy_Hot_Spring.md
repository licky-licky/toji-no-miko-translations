## 1: Being Too Polite Would be Impolite 
[Every chapter title is an onsen related idiom\. It's hard to get across, so I went with whatever works\.]

  
**Chie:** I'm sorry to call you out here so suddenly, Ellen-san, Yui-chan\.  
**Yui:** Don't worry about a thing\! For you, Chie-san, I'd come running through hell or high water\!  
**Ellen:** That's right, Chie\.  
**Chie:** I'm glad to hear that then\.  
**Ellen:** It doesn't sound like you called us here to play around\. Is this a mission\?  
**Chie:** That's right\. Someone needs to suppress aradama that have infested a hot spring\.  
**Ellen:** Oh\! A hot spring\?  
**Yui:** Count me in-\!  
**Yui:** First we can wash off the tiredness from getting there, then we can wash off the tiredness from getting rid of the aradama\!  
**Chie:** About that, from the sound of things, the aradama have taken up in the source of the springwater\.  
**Chie:** Because of that, they can no longer maintain the spring, so no one is allowed in\.  
**Yui:** Oh no\!  
**Ellen:** No one can enter the springs\.\.\.\? That's big trouble\!  
**Chie:** It seems like it\. This month is the busy season for the inn, so the aradama are stopping their business\.  
**Yui:** \.\.\.I won't forgive them\.  
**Yui:** A hot springs inn without a hot spring is just an inn\!  
**Yui:** We have to stop these aradama as soon as possible\!  
**Chie:** It's a bit of a long trip, so why don't we meet back up after getting our things together\? Would that be alright\?  
**Ellen/Yui:** Sure-\!  
**Chie:** Let's see\.\.\. Mm, that should be everything\. I'm all set\.  
**Chie:** \"I'm finished here\. How are things with you two\?\" Sent\.  
**Chie:** \.\.\.Ah, they already replied\. Hmm, oh, it seems like they'll take a little longer\.  
**Chie:** That leaves me with some free time, but\.\.\. What to do\?  
**Chie:** I ended up coming to the meeting spot early\. Well\.\.\. It's better than showing up late\.  
**Mihono:** Huh, Chii-nee\? What're you doing with that suitcase\?  
**Mihono:** Are you going on a trip\?  
**Chie:** Just a bit of a long distance mission that came up\.  
**Chie:** It could end up taking the rest of the week, so I needed a few changes of clothes\.  
**Mihono:** Ehh\!\? So you won't be here this weekend\!\? That's too bad\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** I wanted to go on a sweets tour with you\.\.\. But I guess we can't now\?  
**Chie:** Nnn\.\.\. When you use those puppy dog eyes of yours, Mihono-chan\.\.\.  
**Chie:** But\.\.\. I'm sorry\. No matter how much I hurry, I probably won't be back before the weekend is over\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Really\.\.\. Okay\! Since it's a mission, I know you can't help it\!  
**Mihono:** Who are you going with\?  
**Yui:** That'd be me\!  
**Ellen:** And me too\!  
**Mihono:** Yui and Ellen-san\! Huh, I wouldn't expected you guys to get grouped together\.  
**Yui:** Think again, Mihono-chan\! You see, Ellen-san and Chie-san both have an overwhelming motherly nature in common\!  
**Chie:** Mmm, I don't think I'm much of the motherly type\. I'm an onee-san after all\.\.\.  
**Yui:** No no, look, you two have such huge motherly attributes right there\!  
**Ellen:** I see, our breasts, huh\. I think you'd get along with Nene, Yuiyui\.  
**Yui:** I've heard the rumors too\. I'd like to have a nice long chat with Nene someday\!  
**Mihono:** Looks like a fun team though, Chii-nee\.  
**Chie:** Fufu, I agree\.  

## 2: Neither Doctors nor Springwater (Can Cure Lovesickness\)
**Mihono:** Hmm, what do I do now\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** Good morning, Hono-chan\.  
**Mihono:** Ah, morning, Kiyoka\.  
**Kiyoka:** I heard you groaning back there\. Did you forget to do your homework\?  
**Mihono:** Nah, I finished all of it this time\. But that's not it, Chii-nee left on a long assignment yesterday\.  
**Kiyoka:** Oh, I heard about that from Yui-chan\.  
**Kiyoka:** She said \"There's a big aradama infestation, so it could take until the start of next week\! Sorry, I won't be able to play with you this weekend\!\"  
**Mihono:** Did you have plans to do something with Yui\?  
**Kiyoka:** No, we didn't talk about anything\.  
**Mihono:** Ahaha, that's Yui alright\.  
**Mihono:** Actually, I was thinking of going somewhere with Chii-nee this weekend\!  
**Kiyoka:** Oh, so that's why you looked so disappointed\.  
**Mihono:** Yeah\. What were you going to do this weekend, Kiyoka\?  
**Mihono:** Have you made any plans yet\?  
**Kiyoka:** I was planning on visiting a hot spring with a senpai from my school\.  
**Kiyoka:** We started talking about it a long time ago\.  
**Mihono:** A hot spring\!  
**Mihono:** Sounds nice\. Do I know that senpai of yours\? If it's okay with you two, I'd want to tag along\!  
**Kiyoka:** Mmhm, you know them\. It's Juujou-san\.  
**Kiyoka:** If you want to go with us\.\.\. It doesn't hurt to ask, so why don't we go talk to her together at lunchtime\?  
**Mihono:** Okay\!  
**Kiyoka:** Juujou-saaan\!  
**Hiyori:** Kiyoka\? I was looking for you\. There's something I wanted to ask\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Hey, it's Kaoru-san\.  
**Kaoru:** I'm guessing you two wanted to talk about the same thing\. You want to go to the hot spring too\?  
**Mihono:** Yep, that's right\! Are you going too\?  
**Kaoru:** Ellen was busy and I had nothing else to do, and that's when I heard about this trip\.  
**Mihono:** Hey, we're totally in the same boat\! Hot springs are the best, aren't they\?  
**Mihono:** You get to soak in the water, and eat great food, and play table tennis\.  
**Kaoru:** Table tennis\.\.\. I'm pretty good at that, you know\?  
**Mihono:** I'm not about to lose either\!  
**Kiyoka:** \.\.\.Umm, the hot spring we were planning on visiting doesn't actually have table tennis there\.  
**Mihono:** Ehh\!\? There's no table tennis\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** But I still feel like competing, so why don't we play it now\?  
**Kaoru:** Pass\. Listen up, Mihono\. Table tennis is always fun when there's a hot spring to get in nearby\.  
**Kaoru:** But if we do it here, we'd only be working up a sweat\.  
**Mihono:** Isn't working up a sweat a good thing\?  
**Kaoru:** It's just tiring\. Without a hot spring to cure that tiredness, table tennis loses half its appeal\.  
**Mihono:** Isn't that a different appeal though\? But if they don't have table tennis, we can always think up some other kind of exercise\.  
**Kaoru:** A bigger workout gets another pass\. Table tennis is just barely at the acceptable level of exercise\. Ideally, it should be something we can do in our room\.  
**Mihono:** Then\.\.\. How about a pillow fight\?  
**Kiyoka:** I think we'd need a few more people than just the four of us for a good pillow fight\.  
**Hiyori:** We can think about what we'll do later\. For starters, we need to tell the inn we're bringing more people\.  
**Kiyoka:** Please do\.\.\. Ah, what about ghost stories\?  
**Hiyori:** Ghost stories\? I've never done that before, but is telling scary stories really that interesting\?  
**Kiyoka:** It's interesting because it's scary\! And aside from ghost stories, we can talk about love too\!  
**Hiyori:** Talk about love\.\.\.\!\?  
**Kaoru:** That's about as standard as it gets, but\.\.\. Does any of us even have a partner\?  
**Kaoru:** Just putting this out there, but I don't\.  
**Hiyori:** A-As if I have someone like that\!  
**Mihono:** I don't think I do either\. Besides, what's more important now is our duty as toji\!  
**Hiyori:** That's right, well said, Mihono\!  
**Kiyoka:** I don't either\.\.\. So I guess we should tell scary stories after all\.  
**Mihono:** Ughh\.\.\. So that's how it'll be\. I'm not great with scary stories\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** Fufufu, get yourself ready, Hono-chan\. I'll have a lot of scary stories in store for everyone\!  

## 3: A Waste of One's Efforts
**Hiyori:** We can't go in the spring\?  
**Landlady:** I'm very sorry\. Because aradama appeared in the source of the springwater, we can't maintain it anymore\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** But we came all this way\.\.\. What should we do\?  
**Hiyori:** There's nothing to think about\. We should just exterminate those aradama\.  
**Mihono:** I agree with Juujou-san\!  
**Mihono:** And after we beat the aradama, we can get in the hot spring\. It's two birds with one stone\.  
**Kiyoka:** \.\.\.You're right\. We came this far, so we can't leave without getting in the water\!  
**Kaoru:** You all look like you made your minds up\.  
**Hiyori:** Are you against this, Kaoru\?  
**Kaoru:** It seems like a lot of work\.  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.That's how I feel, but somebody's got to do this\. I'll go along with you guys\.  
**Hiyori:** I've never seen you put up that little resistance before\.  
**Kaoru:** It'd be way more annoying coming out here and not even getting in a hot spring, after all\.  
**Kaoru:** Seems like a lot of work though\.  
**Hiyori:** Then that's settled\. Where is the spring's source\?  
**Landlady:** It's up that mountain\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** Ah, that way\? Good, we can leave now\.  
**Mihono/Kiyoka:** Yeah\!  
**Nene:** Ne-\!  
**Landlady:** P-Please wait\. It's dangerous if you leave right now\. The sun will be setting soon, and the forecast said the snowfall tonight will be terrible\.  
**Mihono:** Snow up on a mountain at night\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** I'm worried that we won't be able to stop the aradama\.  
**Kaoru:** It can be dangerous up on a snowy mountain if you're not used to it\. What do you want to do\?  
**Hiyori:** Let's see\.\.\.  
**Landlady:** U-Um, three toji had already set out to suppress the aradama before you arrived\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** What\?  
**Landlady:** I'm sorry, I should have told you right away\.  
**Landlady:** They took care of the aradama in town yesterday, and today they went to the spring's source\.\.\.  
**Karou:** If there's already toji dealing with it, why don't we just wait here and see how things go tonight\?  
**Kaoru:** They might even be suppressing the aradama right now\.  
**Hiyori:** I can't deny that, but\.\.\. What do you two think\?  
**Kiyoka:** I think we should do what Kaoru-san says and wait here tonight\.  
**Kiyoka:** Fighting in the dark and snow\.\.\. It sounds sort of scary\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** If I had to say, I think I'm with Kiyoka on this\.  
**Kaoru:** It's three against one, Hiyori\.  
**Hiyori:** I-I never said I was against waiting here\!  
**Hiyori:** We'll stay here at the inn tonight\! Got that\!  
**Kiyoka:** This is something that actually happened to my mother\.\.\. It was in\.\.\. That's right, it was an inn just like this one\.  
**Mihono:** Gulp\.  
**Kiyoka:** My mother went on a trip with some friends to a hot spring\. They got in the spring, ate a good meal, and relaxed\.\.\. Before they knew it, it was 10 at night\.  
**Kaoru:** Hey, that's almost just like us here\.  
**Hiyori:** D-Don't make unnecessary comments in the middle of the story\!  
**Kaoru:** You getting scared-\?  
**Hiyori:** N-N-N-Nobody's scared\! Kiyoka\! Just keep going\!  
**Kiyoka:** \"The water was so nice, wasn't it\?\" \"Want to go get back in\?\" As they chatted like that into the night, they heard a voice from the other side of the sliding door\.  
**Kiyoka:** \"Would any of you guests like a massage\?\"  
**Kaoru:** That's sexual harassment\.  
**Kiyoka:** No, apparently it was a woman's voice\. My mother refused, and they didn't hear from the voice again\.  
**Kiyoka:** But\.\.\. It was strange\.  
**Mihono:** Wh-What was\?  
**Kiyoka:** They heard the voice from the other side of the sliding door, right\? But on the other side of that\.\.\. There should have been a locked door\.  
**Hiyori:** Eek\.\.\.\!  
**Kiyoka:** My mother and her friends quickly realized it\. \"Eh\? What does that mean\? We did lock the door, didn't we\?\"  
**Kiyoka:** \"\.\.\.Should we go check\?\"  
**Kaoru:** Oh, there's a death flag\.  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.Gulp\.  
**Kiyoka:** They found their courage and slid open the door\. But there was no one there\.  
**Mihono:** Th-The lock\! Did they lock the door or not\!\?  
**Kiyoka:** It still seemed to be locked\. They looked out through the peephole and couldn't see anyone in the hallway\.  
**Hiyori:** W-Well then there wasn't anyone there, was there\.  
**Kiyoka:** My mother and her friends thought the same thing, and started feeling safer\. But, at that moment, they heard a knocking at the door\.  
**Kiyoka:** Like\.\.\.  
**Hiyori/Mihono:** GYAAAA-----\!\!  
**Kaoru:** Who's at the door this late\? Did you attract a real ghost by telling scary stories\?  
**Hiyori:** A-A-A-As if something like that could happen\! Ghosts are just a silly superstition\!  
**Kaoru:** If they're not real, then you go answer the door, Hiyori\.  
**Hiyori:** W-Wait\! R-Rock paper scissors\.\.\.\! We'll decide who answers it with rock paper scissors\!  
**Mihono:** I can't afford to lose\.\.\.\! Where there's a will, there's a way\!  
**Kiyoka:** I don't think you need to be so serious about this\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** Then, here we go\.\.\. Rock paper scissors\!  
**Everyone:** Shoot\!  
**Kiyoka:** Ah, I lost\. I'll be right back\.  
**Kiyoka:** Hello, who is i\.\.\. KYAAAAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Hiyori/Mihono:** UWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH\!\!  
**Yui:** Kiyoka-chan, you're so waaaaaaaaaarm\!  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.Wait, Yui\!\?  

## 4:　Something's Better than Nothing
--Several hours earlier\.

  
**Chie:** Those must be the aradama holed up in the spring's source\.  
**Ellen:** There's a lot more of them than I expected\.  
**Yui:** We can handle that many no problem\! Just have to wipe 'em out with a BANG\!  
**Yui:** And when we get back, the hot spring will be waiting\!  
**Chie:** \.\.\.What do you think, Ellen-san\?  
**Ellen:** We don't have to push our luck here\. Snow, night, and the mountains would be a bad mix\.  
**Chie:** I agree\. We located the aradama, so we should head back for today\.  
**Chie:** So we returned here, and the landlady told us more toji had arrived\.  
**Ellen:** And I was surprised to see you, Kaoru\! Why did you come\?  
**Kaoru:** Just a coincidence\. Me and Mihono joined in on the hot springs trip Hiyori and Kiyoka planned\.  
**Yui:** Ehh, you didn't tell me anything about that\.  
**Kiyoka:** Eeep\! Don't look at me\!  
**Yui:** But, now I have Kiyoka-chan with me, so all's well that ends well\!  
**Yui:** Warm me up, Kiyoka-chan\! Pant, pant, sniff, sniff\!  
**Kiyoka:** I don't want a hug-\!\? Just- let- go- please-\!  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.Is it okay to let her do that\?  
**Mihono:** Kiyoka and Yui are really friendly, so it's okay\!  
**Mihono:** Anyway, I'm glad it wasn't a ghost\. Right, Juujou-san\!  
**Ellen:** A ghost\?  
**Hiyori:** I-It's not important\!  
**Kiyoka:** Uuu, they forgot about me\.\.\. Somebody, helppp\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** Anyway, it's good to see that you three were the toji they sent out\.  
**Hiyori:** We'll be joining you tomorrow\.  
**Ellen:** That'd be a big help\! We were worried about what to do, since there were so many aradama\!  
**Chie:** Fufu, we can take care of them together and then all join in back at the hot spring\.  
**Ellen:** Sounds nice, Chie\! Nothing takes off the fatigue like a hot spring\!  
**Yui:** Hooray-\! They say good things come in pairs, and I see plenty of pairs around me\!   
**Chie:** [peaceful sleeping]\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** [heavier sleeping]\.\.\.  
**Yui:** [homosexual sleeping]\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** They're all asleep\.  
**Kaoru:** They had to march their way through a mountain in the snow\. They must be worn out\.  
**Kiyoka:** \.\.\.Yui-chan was actually tired\.  
**Kiyoka:** Um, is there anything we can do to help them\?  
**Hiyori:** Besides going to eliminate the aradama together\?  
**Kiyoka:** Yes\! Like, for example\.\.\. Getting a nutritious meal ready for them\!  
**Kaoru:** We're at an inn, you know\? I'm sure the people here can make something better than us\.  
**Kaoru:** Why don't we ask them to make their favorites for them at least\?  
**Kiyoka:** That sounds nice too\.\.\.\!  
**Mihono:** Also, why don't we take care of the aradama ourselves\?  
**Mihono:** That's what we were going to do at first anyway, right\?  
**Hiyori:** We hadn't decided on that yet\.\.\. But no, that could work\.  
**Hiyori:** Should we do that\?  
**Ellen:** Nnn\.\.\. Kaoru\.\.\. That's not a kanpyou maki\.\.\. That's chikuwa\.  
**Kaoru:** What kinda dream is that\. Anyway, why don't we all just go together\?  
**Kiyoka:** \.\.\.I agree with Hono-chan and Juujou-san\.  
**Hiyori:** Heh, three against one, is it\?  
**Kaoru:** Fine then, I'll go\.  
**Ellen:** It's a beautiful morning\! Wake up, Chie, Yui\!  
**Chie:** Yawn\.\.\. Morning, everyone\.\.\. Hm\? Where's Mihono-chan\?  
**Yui:** Bad news\! Kiyoka-chan and them\.\.\. They asked the landlady to make our favorite food, then went ahead to deal with the aradama\!  

## 5:　All Things in Moderation
**Mihono:** I wonder if the landlady made their favorite foods after all\.  
**Kiyoka:** I don't think we have to worry about that\. It was short notice, but I'm glad she was willing to hear us out\.  
**Hiyori:** Agreed\. I'm sure they're eating their fill right about now\.  
**Kaoru:** Yawn\.\.\. If we were back at the inn, we'd be in the middle of breakfast now, huh\. Never thought I'd be getting up this early on a hot springs trip\.  
**Hiyori:** You can take all the time you want in the spring after these aradama are cleared out\.  
**Hiyori:** Let's keep moving\.  
**Kiyoka:** According to the map, this should be the source, but\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** They're all over\.  
**Mihono:** Ten\.\.\. Twenty\.\.\. Thirty\.\.\. There's too many to count\!  
**Kaoru:** Way too many\. Too much for us to deal with by ourselves\.  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.\.\.\.You're right\. Instead of acting cool, we should send a message back\. \.\.\.Does anyone have signal\?  
**Kaoru:** Just barely, but I can get through\.  
**Hiyori:** Good\. Kiyoka and Mihono, you should move around softly so the cold doesn't get to you\.  
**Mihono:** Okay\!  
**Kiyoka:** Uuu, it's so cold, Hono-chan\. If only we'd brought some hot tea with us\.  
**Mihono:** I know, right\? When it's this cold, you\.\.\. Ah\.\.\. Ah\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** Ah\?  
**Mihono:** ACHOO\!\!  
**Kaoru:** Idiot\! Why'd you have to go and sneeze at a time like this\!  
**Mihono:** Ughh, I'm sorry-\!  
**Hiyori:** Tch, they noticed us\!  
**Kiyoka:** Wh-What do we do now\!\?  
**Hiyori:** We don't have a choice\.\.\. Kiyoka, stick with me\!  
**Kiyoka:** Ah, o-okay\!  
**Kaoru:** So that means you're with me, Mihono\.  
**Mihono:** Got it\!  
**Kaoru:** Come on, here we go\!  
**Nene:** Ne-\!  
**Chie:** We should have told them just how many aradama there were\.  
**Ellen:** Even if it's a little dangerous, they were only worried about us\.  
**Chie:** I'm glad they felt that way, but\.\.\. As an onee-san, there are some times you have to get angry\.  
**Yui:** They said they'd hide out and wait for us to get there, so it's not like you have to get mad at them, right\?  
**Ellen:** A good call\! That was smart of them, wasn't it\!  
**Chie:** \.\.\.Did you hear something just now\?  
**Ellen:** I did\. It sounded like someone was fighting\.\.\.  
**Yui:** No no no\! It didn't sound \"like someone's fighting\", that is someone fighting\!  
**Chie:** We have to hurry\!  
**Mihono:** There's just too many aradamaaa\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** Watch your head, Mihono\!  
**Mihono:** Awawa\!  
**Kaoru:** Damnit, where'd all that energy you had at the start go\?  
**Mihono:** Sorry\.\.\. I ran out of concentration\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** Hyaah-\!\?  
**Hiyori:** Tch\! Hang in there, Kiyoka\!  
**Kiyoka:** Uuu\.\.\. I can't do anything, against all of them\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** Oh\! Looks like a hard fight\! Chie, let's back them up\!  
**Chie:** Ellen-san, you go to Mihono-chan and Kaoru-san\. Yui-chan, you come with me\!  
**Yui:** Right\!  
**Ellen:** Kaoru-\! I'm here to rescue you-\!  
**Kaoru:** Ellen\? We're saved\!  
**Yui:** You okay, Kiyoka-chan\?  
**Kiyoka:** Chie-san\! Yui-chan\!  
**Chie:** Juujou-san, leave Kiyoka-chan to Yui-chan and I\.  
**Hiyori:** Alright, watch after her\. HAAAH\!  
**Kaoru:** Guess that's the end of them\. Ahh, I'm beat\.  
**Ellen:** That's a big win\!  
**Kiyoka:** Thank you, Chie-san\.  
**Chie:** Fufu, I'm your onee-san after all\. Don't mention it\.  
**Hiyori:** Thanks\.\.\. Ellen, Chie, Yui\. You saved us\.  
**Yui:** Think nothing of it\! Let's just race back to the spring\!  
**Mihono:** Yeah-\!  

## 6: Greater Than the Sum of Its Parts
**Ellen:** Now for the hot spring\!  
**Hiyori:** We just came in from the cold, after all\. We should warm up before we get sick\.  
**Kaoru:** Ahh, finally, we can get in\. Come on, Nene\.  
**Nene:** Nene-\!  
**Chie:** Fufu, it's been a while since we took a bath together, Mihono-chan\.  
**Mihono:** I'll wash your back for you, Chii-nee\.  
**Chie:** Okay, I'd appreciate it\.  
**Yui:** Mihono-chan, behind Chie-san\.\.\. Guhe, guhehe\.\.\.  
**Yui:** Kiyoka-chan, why don't we try that too\?  
**Kiyoka:** I refuse\!  
**Yui:** BWHAA-\!  
**Mihono:** Blood came spewing out of Yui's nose\!\?  
**Yui:** Pant, pant\.\.\. J-Just ignore that, l-let me wash your\.\.\. BWHAA\!\!  
**Mihono:** It did it again\!\?  
**Ellen:** You might have a thin nasal membrane, Yuiyui\. It's probably best if you stay out of the hot spring\.  
**Yui:** But that's too cruel\!  
**Chie:** Why don't you try calming down a little for now\? Here, come here\.  
**Yui:** Chie-san's are\.\.\. This close to me\.\.\. BWHAA\!  
**Chie:** Kyaa\!\? Ellen-san, help me get her out of here\!  
**Ellen:** Got it\!  
**Yui:** I'm spent\.\.\. Nothing's coming out anymore\.\.\. Gagh\.  
**Kaoru:** That's fine, then you won't be getting your nosebleed in the water\.  
**Nene:** Nene-\.  
**Kaoru:** Ahh\.\.\. Feels like I came back to life\. Some kanpyou maki would hit the spot right now\.  
**Mihono:** Kanpyou maki\.\.\. Should we ask the landlady for some\?  
**Kaoru:** Maybe later\.\.\. Anyway, come on in, Mihono\. The water's great\.  
**Mihono:** Okay\! \.\.\.Ahhhh, it's so warm\.  
**Kaoru:** Feels better because of how cold it was out on the mountain\. Makes it all worth it\.  
**Mihono:** Ahh, sorry I messed things up for us, back there\.  
**Kaoru:** Eh, all's well that ends well\. No point overthinking it when we were gonna fight anyway\.  
**Mihono:** Okay, thanks, Kaoru-san\!  
**Ellen:** What are you talking about now, Kaoru\?  
**Kaoru:** Nothing much\. Anyway, what happened with Yui\?  
**Chie:** She'll be fine; we spoke to the landlady\. When she's feeling better she can join us\.  
**Ellen:** With that settled\.\.\. Nnn-\! Nothing beats an hot spring after a mission\!  
**Chie:** I know\. Swinging an okatana around like that is always so hard on your back and shoulders, isn't it\?  
**Hiyori:** What are you talking about\.\.\.\? Phew, I can feel the springwater soaking in\.  
**Kiyoka:** \.\.\.Um, Yui-chan was sound asleep in the dressing room\.\.\. What happened\?  
**Mihono:** It sounds like Yui has thin nasal membranes and needed some rest\.  
**Kiyoka:** Her nasal membranes\.\.\.\! Then I guess we should just let her sleep, right\!  
**Chie:** Anyway, you all gave me a scare this morning\. I never thought you'd go and leave without us\.  
**Ellen:** I know\! It's rude of you to leave your friends behind like that, Kaoru\!  
**Kaoru:** Hey, you know I wanted to sleep in\. But Kiyoka here wouldn't stop until we did something to help you guys out\.  
**Kiyoka:** Awawa\! I-I didn't mean for it to get out of hand like that, but you all looked so tired, so I just wondered if there was something we could do to help\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** Well, thank you very much, Kiyoka\!  
**Kiyoka:** You're welcome\.\.\. (bubble bubble\)  
**Mihono:** Kiyoka\.\.\. Are you embarrassed\?  
**Kiyoka:** \.\.\.Just a little, maybe\.  
**Yui:** I sensed something sort of yuri happening, so Yamashiro Yui is back in action-\! Everyone, come let me wash your\.\.\. BWHAA\!  
**Ellen:** So much for back in action\.  
**Chie:** Honestly, someone's going to have to keep watch over her\.  
**Yui:** Why does this have to happen to me\.\.\. Just try a little harder, my nasal membranes-\!\!
