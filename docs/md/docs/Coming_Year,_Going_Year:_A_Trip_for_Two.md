## 1: On a New Year's Trip for Two\!
**Mihono:** Pant, pant\.\.\. Thank goodness\! We made it to the train right on schedule\.  
**Chie:** Slow down, Mihono-chan\! Honestly, if we missed this train, we could have just caught the next one\. Why are you in such a rush\?  
**Mihono:** That's cause, I get to go on a big trip with Chii-nee, of course\! There's a whole bunch of things I want to do, so I want to follow the schedule exactly\.  
**Mihono:** Ah\! That reminds me\. These are our schedules for this trip\. This one's for you, Chii-nee\.  
**Chie:** You made these yourself\!\? They're thick too, aren't they\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Ehehe\. Once I started writing down all the places I wanted to see and the things I wanted to do, it started getting really long\.  
**Chie:** Fufu\. Well, thank you for going to the trouble\. And also, this schedule is so detailed, isn't it\? You have what we'll be doing divided down to the minutes\.  
**Mihono:** I thought we'd get through every one of my goals for the trip, so it ended up being tighter than I expected\. But, when it's us two, where there's a will, there's a way\! Right\?  
**Chie:** Well, if we go down the list, we might be able to manage it\.\.\. But, don't you think it would be better to relax a bit more\?  
**Mihono:** We can't do that\! Let's do all of it\! Cause we came on this trip together\!  
**Chie:** (\? Mihono-chan's acting different than usual\.\.\. I wonder what's gotten into her\.\.\.\)  
**Mihono:** Hey, we can do all of it, right\? That'll be fine, right, Chii-nee\?  
**Chie:** O-Of course, so long as you're happy, Mihono-chan\. It is our last trip of the year, after all\.  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.  
**Chie:** \.\.\.What's wrong\? You're making such a sad face\.  
**Mihono:** Ah-\! It's nothing\! Yeah, I'm just fine\! It's all alright\!  
**Chie:** Are you sure\? Then, if you say so\.\.\.  
**Chie:** Oh, I'm getting a call from school\. What if it's about a mission\.\.\. I'll just step out of the compartment for a minute while I take this\.  
**Mihono:** She left\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** Oh\? Hono-chan\. What are you doing here\? Are you going somewhere\?  
**Mihono:** Kiyoka\! And Iwakura-san too\! You too; what are you doing here\?  
**Sanae:** We're on our way to take care of an expedition assignment\. Everyone else seems to already be on their New Year's break, but this is our last work day of the year\.  
**Kiyoka:** What about you, Hono-chan\? You're already on your vacation, aren't you\?  
**Mihono:** Yeah\! Chii-nee and me are using our New Year's break to go on a trip together, starting today\. See, look at this\! It's our trip guide\. I made it myself, and I'm pretty proud of how it turned out\!  
**Sanae:** Wow, that's incredible\! The schedule is packed tight too; it's just dripping with your excitement for the trip\.  
**Kiyoka:** It sure is\. I think it seems like a little much to do in just two days and one night though\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Well, that's because, Chii-nee's going to\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Ah\! Nevermind that\! It's nothing, so don't worry about it\! Okay\!  
**Sanae:** Doesn't it seem like Asakura-san was hiding something just now\?  
**Kiyoka:** It does\. It's like Hono-chan's worried about something important on this trip\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** Ahh, while we were chatting, we arrived at our stop\. Anyway, Hono-chan, have fun on your trip, okay\.  
**Mihono:** Thanks--\! You two take care too\!  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.Chii-nee sure is taking a while\. I wonder if she's still on the phone\.\.\.  
**Chie:** Mihono-chan, sorry I took so long\! I bought ice cream from the train\. Let's have it together\.  
**Mihono:** Awesome-\! Thanks, Chii-nee\! I'll dig right in\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Wait, huh\!\? The ice cream's so frozen my spoon won't go in\!   
**Chie:** Fufu, you're right\. It's a frozen as ice\. We'll have to warm it up so it gets softer\.  
**Chie:** \~\~\! So cold\!   
**Chie:** \!\? Mihono-chan\? You didn't have to take a picture now\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** But, isn't getting to see you warming up ice cream with your hands the kind of thing you'd see on a trip\?  
**Chie:** Honestly\.\.\. Then, at least take it with the both of us\. Just set it on a timer, and\.\.\.  
**Chie:** Oh, the ice cream's melting\! Mihono-chan, here you go\.  
**Mihono:** Thanks\! Ahhm\!  
**Mihono:** Look, look, Chii-nee\! It took the picture right when we were taking abite\!  
**Chie:** Wow, it sure did\! You can see the scenery out the window too\. We've only just started and already we've gotten a wonderful photo of our trip\.  
**Mihono:** Yeah\! Let's keep this up and make a whole bunch of memories here\!  
**Chie:** Sure\!  
**Chie:** \.\.\.Ah\! It looks like we're here at the station\. Mihono-chan, be sure you don't forget anything, okay\?  
**Mihono:** Here we are\! In the guidebook, it says the locals welcome tourists here with singing and dancing, but\.\.\.  
**Aradama:** Guooooo\.\.\.  
**Chie:** Aradama\! For them to be here of all places\.  
**Mihono:** And our trip's barely even started\! We have to get rid of them quick, so we can make a bunch of memories like we planned on\!  

## 2: It's Hard Sticking to the Schedule\!\?
**Mihono:** Phew, we beat the aradama, so let's get our trip back on track\!  
**Chie:** First, we need to try the limited offer mitarashi dango they sell at the station\.\.\.  
**Chie:** Oh no; they're all sold out for today\!\?  
**Mihono:** Eh-\!\? But\.\.\.  
**Shopkeeper:** Sorry about that, we just sold out\. If you'd been here five minutes sooner\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Uuu\.\.\. Just five minutes\.\.\. If only those aradama weren't here\.\.\.  
**Chie:** There's nothing we can do about it\. Even if we are off duty, it's still a toji's responsibility to suppress aradama\.  
**Shopkeeper:** Oh, you two were dealing with some aradama\? Then, as thanks, take this\. It's fresh bread from a local bakery\.  
**Mihono:** Whoaa\~, it smells great\. And it's warm too; I bet it's yummy\!  
**Shopkeeper:** About that bakery, they don't mention it in the guidebooks\. It's a special little place only the locals know about\. Here, eat it before it goes cold\.  
**Chie:** Thank you very much\. Then, we'll take you up on that\. Ohm\.\.\.  
**Chie:** Mm, it's delicious\!  
**Mihono:** It really is\! This is good\! It's nice and hot and fluffy; I feel like I could eat this forever\!  
**Chie:** Fufu, I'm glad to see you're cheering up now, Mihono-chan\. Suppressing the aradama might have taken some of our time, but because of that, we found something nice we weren't expecting\.  
**Mihono:** Yeah, it's all because the locals were nice to us that we got to eat such good bread\. This'll be a good memory too, won't it\!  
**Sanae:** Hm\? We ran into each other again\!  
**Chie:** Kiyoka-chan, Sanae-chan\! You two were on an expedition, weren't you\? Did you finish that up already\?  
**Sanae:** Yes\. We managed to take care of it sooner than expected, so I talked with Musumi-san about doing a little sightseeing before we went back\.  
**Kiyoka:** If you take the bus from in front of the station, you can get to a a lake with a power spot that's secretly famous\.  
**Mihono:** For real\!\? That wasn't in any of the guidebooks I read, but it sounds cool\! Chii-nee, do you want to go check it out too\?  
**Chie:** Sure\! Having a spur of the moment change of plans is part of the thrill of going on a trip\. Let's go see\!  
**Sanae:** If we're all going, then let's hurry over to the bus stop\. The bus only comes twice per day, so we have to be careful not to miss it\.  
**Mihono:** This place is that rare, huh\! I'm getting excited; it's like we're going exploring\!  
**Aradama:** Guooooooo\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Eh-\!\? More aradama\!\? This time for sure, I won't let them ruin our trip\!  
**Kiyoka:** Let's all fight our best, to get to that power spot\!  
**Chie:** Here I go\! HAA\!  
**Sanae:** TAAAAAAH\!  
**Kiyoka:** Pant, pant\.\.\. No matter how many we defeat, more are appearing\.\.\. This might be too much for the four of us\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Uuu\.\.\. We're running out of time doing this too-\!  
**Maki:** We'll be backing you up\!  
**Sanae:** Shidou-senpai\!\?  
**Mihono:** And Tsubakuro-san too\!  
**Yume:** Kyahaha\. Looks like I'll be able to beat a whole ton of them here\!  
**Yume:** EIII---\!  

## 3: On a Big Fun Girls Tour Together\!
**Chie:** With Shidou-san and Tsubakuro-san's help, we managed to clean them all out\.  
**Sanae:** But still, what brings you two here anyway\?  
**Maki:** We were on our way back from an expedition, and just happened to be passing through\. I'm glad we could lend a hand\.  
**Yume:** It wasn't really enough to satisfy me though-\. And hey, what are those onee-sans looking all sad for\?  
**Mihono:** Uuu\.\.\. The bus that only comes twice a day left already\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** It's a shame, but I'll have to come see this power spot another time\. Sigh\.\.\.  
**Chie:** Hey, you two\. There's so many other things left for us to do, soit's a waste for you to be moping around now\. Let's cheer up and move on to our next destination\!  
**Sanae:** Setouchi-san is right\! There should be plenty of things left that we can do now\. Like, if we leave from this neighborhood now, we can\.\.\.  
**Maki:** Nn\? What's that\? That big book with all those notes in it\.  
**Sanae:** It's the trip guidebook Asakura-san made\. They were supposed to follow this and have a good time sightseeing, but then aradama appeared\.\.\.  
**Maki:** I see\. It must be frustrating having plans this detailed getting spoiled like that\.  
**Yume:** Let me see it too\!  
**Yume:** Hmm-\! I didn't think there'd be this many neat sounding places this close by here\.  
**Yume:** Maki-onee-san, we should go see them too\!  
**Maki:** Unfortunately, I've got another mission to take care of, so I can't guide you around\. We can do it some other time\.  
**Yume:** Ehh-, but, after coming all the way out here, I wanna play around some-\.  
**Chie:** In that case, would you like to join us, Tsubakuro-san\?  
**Mihono:** Good idea\! I wanna thank you for helping us out, and it's more fun with more people\!  
**Sanae:** Shidou-senpai, we'll take responsibility and make sure she gets home safe, so please don't worry and go on your mission\.  
**Maki:** Alright\. If you insist, then I guess I'll leave her with you\.  
**Maki:** Yume, make sure you do what they tell you, okay\?  
**Yume:** Hooray-\! Come on, onee-sans, let's go right now\!  
**Chie:** Wow, the stained glass is gorgeous\. It was beautiful on the outside, but inside the building, there's such a lovely old fashioned feeling to it\.  
**Mihono:** A bunch of guidebooks said you just had to see the stained glass at this church\!  
**\?\?\?:** \~\~  
**Yume:** Huh\? I hear some pretty voices singing\.  
**Sanae:** It sounds like it's practice time for the choir\. Getting to hear hymns being sung live in such a romantic place is a real luxury\!  
**Mihono:** We must be really lucky, showing up just in time for them to start practicing\!  
**Chie:** That's for sure\. Our plans were thrown off due to the aradama, but we got to experience something this nice thanks to it\.  
**Sanae:** So, next is a cake shop in a studio up in the mountains\. Even though it's so far from town, there's so many customers here\!  
**Kiyoka:** It seems popular enough that people will come far and wide to eat here\. Hono-chan, we found a really nice shop\!  
**Mihono:** Ehehe, we sure did\! Still, there's so many different kinds of cakes, and they all look so good, that it's tough making up your mind\!  
**Chie:** Fufu, in that case, how about we split ours with each other\? That way you can have double the cakes\.  
**Mihono:** Oh yeah\! Nice idea\! I'll have this strawberry shortcake then\! I'll give you the part with the big strawberry, Chii-nee\!  
**Chie:** You can have the chestnuts off the top of my Mont Blanc then, Mihono-chan\.  
**Yume:** Those onee-sans really get along, don't they\.  
**Kiyoka:** They sure do\. Just watching them together makes me feel happier\.  
**Mihono:** Phwah-\! That tasted so good\! Guys-, if you're done eating, next up is a horseriding experience at a farm close by\!  
**Sanae:** Even though we've been stopping by one place after another, there's still more to see\? This really is a whirlwind tour\.  
**Mihono:** Since we had the chance to go on this trip, I wanted to do as much as we can before the sun goes down\!  
**Yume:** I want to ride on the horsies too\! Let's go there fast, onee-sans\!  
**Aradama:** Guooooo\.\.\.  
**Yume:** Hey-\! Why'd aradama have to come out now\!  
**Mihono:** We might've gotten to see a bunch of fun stuff because aradama messed up our schedule, but I still hate them getting in our way\!  
**Chie:** Agreed; let's make sure to defeat them now so they can't interrupt us any more\!  

## 4: Enjoying a Trip to the Hot Springs
**Yume:** Eh-, while we were busy beating the aradama, the sun went down\!  
**Mihono:** Uuu\.\.\. After the horseriding, we were supposed to do mandarin picking at an orange farm, and then there were a ton ton ton more things I wanted to do---\!  
**Chie:** Mihono-chan, cheer up\. It's gotten cold now, so wouldn't it be fine if we just relax at the ryokan and pass the end of the year together\?  
**Chie:** Getting in some hot springs and taking your time in a nice yet unfamiliar room is part of enjoying a trip too, isn't it\?  
**Mihono:** You're right, that does sound fun too, but\.\.\. Uuu\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** Don't let it get you down, Hono-chan\. We're going back now, but you two have a wonderful stay at a ryokan booked for you, don't you\?  
**Sanae:** That's right; didn't you write in the guide all the things you wanted to do in your room together\? I'm sure you'll still have lots of fun from here\!  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.You're right\! This is no time for me to be down in the dumps\!  
**Yume:** Thanks to you onee-sans, I got to have a really fun New Year's Eve\~\. Have fun at the hot springs, okay\?  
**Mihono:** Wow, this room is so pretty looking\! Getting this whole big room just for me and Chii-nee is so deluxe-\!  
**Chie:** Isn't it\? Let's take a short rest here, then go to the hot springs\. It seems like they let you reserve open air baths too\.  
**Mihono:** Whoa-\! I'm getting excited for it now\! And dinner will be waiting for us after we get out of the baths, so there's still lots of fun to have together\!  
**Mihono:** Ahh-, I ate my fill back there\. The hot springs felt so good after eating too\. I'm feeling nice\~\.  
**Mihono:** So, uh, next on the schedule is\.\.\. An end of the year card tournament with Chii-nee\!  
**Chie:** Fufu, you're just full of energy, aren't you\.  
**Chie:** Mihono-chan, the year isn't quite over yet, but thank you for spending it with me\.  
**Mihono:** Chii-nee\.\.\. Don't go saying it's over or anything\!  
**Chie:** Eh\? Why not, Mihono-chan\?  
**Mihono:** Ah\.\.\. Nevermind, it's nothing\. Sorry about that\.  Now, where'd I put the cards\.\.\.  
**Chie:** (What's come over Mihono-chan\? That reminds me, there was a time on the train ride when she acted different from her usual self too\.\)  
**Chie:** (Maybe she was so excited for this that she couldn't sleep last night\? If that's what it is, then I can't let her push herself too hard\.\)  
**Chie:** Mihono-chan, come lie here on this futon for a minute\.  
**Mihono:** Eh\? What's this for, Chii-nee\?  
**Chie:** You must be tired from running around since this morning, right\? I'll give you a massage\.  
**Mihono:** Ehh\!\? You will\?  
**Chie:** Fufu, of course I will\. It's a show of my appreciation for all the fun places you took me to\. Here, lie down\.  
**Mihono:** If you say so, then\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.Ahh\.\.\. That feels so good\~\.  
**Mihono:** Chii-nee, your hands are so waaarm\.  
**Chie:** Fufu, just lie back and relax\.  
**Mihono:** Sure\.\.\. Fuaahh\.\.\. It's like my back is melting; it's too good\~\.  
**Mihono:** Haa\~\.\.\. That feels nice\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Fuah\~\.\.\. Nnn\~\.\.\. Zzz\.\.\.  
**Chie:** Oh, Mihono-chan\? Fufu, she's sleeping now\.  
**Chie:** \.\.\.Her face is so innocent when she's asleep\. I wonder what she's dreaming about\.  
**Mihono:** [mumble mumble\]\.\.\. Chii-nee\.\.\. We're going here next\.\.\.\! Chii-nee\.\.\. Ngh\.\.\.  
**Chie:** Even in her dreams, she's still leading me around\. Thank you very much for taking me on a pleasant journey, Mihono-chan\.  
**Chie:** Yawn\~\. Looking at how happily Mihono-chan's sleeping is making me feel drowsy too\.  
**Chie:** It doesn't look like we'll be able to do a countdown to the new year, so I'll just lie down and we can sleep together\.  
**Chie:** [sleep breathing\]\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** [sleep mumbling\]\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Nn\.\.\.\?  
**Mihono:** WAHH------\!\!  
**Mihono:** (No way-\! I fell asleep\!\?\)  
**Mihono:** (What do I do now; we might not make it for the most important part of this trip--\!\!\)

## 5: Will We Make to the Main Event\!\?
**Chie:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\? Mihono-chan\? What's the matter\? It's still pitch dark outside\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Chii-nee, get up\! If we don't get out there soon, the first sunrise'll happen\!  
**Chie:** If you want to see the sunrise, we can do it from the window here, you know\.  
**Mihono:** There's someplace I want to go with you no matter what though\! I want us to see the first sunrise from there-\!  
**Chie:** (It's been on my mind ever since yesterday, but why is Mihono-chan acting so frantic\? Does she have some special reason\.\.\.\?\)  
**Chie:** Alright then\. If you really want to go, let's go see the first sunrise together\.  
**Mihono:** Uuu, I was prepared for this, but it's still freezing\.\.\. Are you doing okay, Chii-nee\? Sorry, for forcing you to come out in the cold with me\.  
**Chie:** I'm just fine\. But, look at you, your hands are all red\. Here, why not use my gloves\?  
**Mihono:** If I did that, then your hands would get cold\! I'll be fine\! See, I'm doing great\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Achoo\!  
**Chie:** Honestly\.\.\. You're pushing yourself so hard, Mihono-chan\.  
**Chie:** Here, we'll each wear one of my gloves\. And then, we can hold each other's hands with the hand that doesn't have a glove on\. Alright\?  
**Mihono:** Whoa\! Your hand is so warm, Chii-nee\.  
**Chie:** Fufu, that's better, isn't it\? It's almost time for the sunrise, so let's keep going\!  
**Mihono:** Yeah\!  
**Chie:** It's getting brighter out\. Are we almost to where we're going\?  
**Mihono:** Ahh, look down the path\! The first sunrise is coming up\!  
**Chie:** Wow\.\.\. You're right\! It's beautiful\.\.\.\!  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.I'm so glad we made it\. I got to see the first sunrise with Chii-nee\.\.\.\!  
**Chie:** Mmhm\. I'm glad I got to see such a beautiful sunrise with you, Mihono-chan\.  
**Chie:** Thank you for bringing me along\.  
**Mihono:** I'm really happy I got to see the first sunrise together with you too, Chii-nee\.  
**Mihono:** But\.\.\.  
**Chie:** What's wrong, Mihono-chan\?  
**Mihono:** Fighting with aradama took up our time, so we didn't get to do half the things I wanted to\.\.\.  
**Chie:** Oh, Mihono-chan\.\.\. Don't you think there were too many things to do on your list in the first place\? Why were you so desperate to do them all\?  
**Mihono:** That's because\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Since you're four grades higher, you're about to graduate before me, right\? And, when you do, we might be split up again\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** So that's why, while we still have time together, I wanted to make as many memories as possible\.  
**Chie:** Mihono-chan\.\.\.  
**Chie:** Come here\.  
**Mihono:** Wah, you're making me embarassed, rubbing my head out here like that-\.  
**Chie:** Fufu, what's wrong with it\.  
**Chie:** You know, Mihono-chan\. From now on, whatever path I take, the two of us will always be together\. So don't worry\.  
**Chie:** So, the places we didn't get to go on this trip, we can go see together the next time\.  
**Mihono:** Chii-nee\.\.\.  
**Chie:** Fufu, thank goodness\. You're smiling again, Mihono-chan\.  
**Chie:** I know, let's make a wish on the first sunrise\. A wish that we'll be able to peacefully spend another year together\.  
**Mihono:** Good idea\! After all we went through to see this sunrise, whatever we wish for is gonna get granted for sure\!  
**Mihono/Chie:** This year, and the next year, and every year after that, please let us stay happily together\!

## [Casual 20 - Mihono: Start\]: Planning a New Year's Trip
Several days before New Year's Eve\.

  
**Mihono:** I can't take the local gourmet off the list after all, can I\. But, I wanted to put the petting zoo in too\.\.\.  
**Yui:** Huh, what are you doing all by yourself there, Mihono-chan\?  
**Mihono:** Yui, and Mirja-san too\!  
**Mirja:** That's quite a lot of guidebooks you have open\. Are you going on a trip somewhere\?  
**Mihono:** I'm planning on doing an overnight trip on New Year's Eve with Chii-nee\.\.\. And, I was checking what sights we should go see\!  
**Yui:** Two girls, taking a trip into the new year together\.\.\. Just those words alone are enough to make your heart throb\. Maybe I'll tag along too\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** Yamashiro Yui, that would be inconsiderate of you\. And, if I recall, you have missions scheduled as far as New Year's Eve, don't you\?  
**Yui:** Ugh, you're right\.\.\. I'm so jealous Mihono-chan and them get to take their New Year's break early-\.  
**Mihono:** Hang in there, Yui\. I'll be sure to get souvenirs to bring back for everyone\.   
**Yui:** Souvenirs are nice and all, but more than that, I want to see lovey dovey photos of you two on your trip\!  
**Yui:** Please, help me get through my missions on New Year's Eve\! Send them to me as you go\! I'll be waiting for them\!  
**Mihono:** O-Okay, sure\. I'll send them when I remember to\.  
**Yui:** If I can get some shots of two dreamy girls spending a heart-pounding New Year's tour together, I feel like I'll be able to pull through\! You have to send them to me no matter what\! It's a promise\!  
**Mihono:** Okay, I'll do what I can, but, what kind of photos do you want anyway\?  
**Yui:** Let's see\.\.\. How about, photos of the two of you feeding each other food you bought on the train, like, \"Ahhn\"\!  
**Yui:** And then, photos of you staring deep into each others' eyes on the beach while you share your love, and photos of the two of you proposing in a romantic church deep in the mountains\!  
**Mirja:** I can't help but feel your suggestions are leading towards something other than a normal tour for two girls\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Well, I was hoping to have something a little more exciting for us to do together, but do you have any ideas, Mirja-san\?  
**Mirja:** If you are planning a New Year's trip, a shrine visit and viewing the first sunrise would be standard suggestions\.  
**Mirja:** And, if time permits, it might be good to work in something slightly more original\.  
**Mihono:** Something more original\? Like what\?  
**Mirja:** For example, rather than simply viewing the first sunrise on New Year's day, why not admire the setting sun on New Year's Eve\?  
**Mirja:** It's something I've considered for some time now\. Everyone glorifies the year's first sunrise, but why do they pay no attention to the year's last sunset\?  
**Mihono:** You're right, every year things are so busy on the evening of New Year's Eve that I don't think I've ever sat back and watched the sun go down\.  
**Yui:** Yeah yeah, me too-\.  
**Yui:** But you know, if I were the sun, I'd be happy having everyone admire me on New Year's morning, but I think I'd want people admiring me on the last sunset after I worked so hard all year too\!  
**Mirja:** I've never exactly thought about how it would make the sun feel\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** I've always thought that those who can appreciate the sunset, the same as they would the sunrise, will get the most benefit from the year's first sunrise the next morning\.  
**Mihono:** I get it\! I think that's a great way of looking at it\. It might give us better fortune from watching the sunrise, so I I'll try putting watching the sunset into our plan too\!  
**Mihono:** Okaaay, now just to find the perfect place to watch the sunset with Chii-nee\!  

## [Casual 20 - Mihono: End\]: At the Year's Final Sunset\.\.\.
On New Year's Eve\. Partway through Mihono and Chie's trip together, they happened to meet Kiyoka, Sanae, and Yume, and all went to watch the sunset from an observation tower together\.

  
**Mihono:** Chii-nee, look, look\! The setting sun looks so pretty\!  
**Chie:** It sure is pretty, isn't it\. Ah, Mihono-chan, it looks like we can go out onto the deck from there\.  
**Mihono:** Whoa, the wind's strong out here\. Chii-nee, be careful so your scarf doesn't get blown away, okay\!  
**Chie:** Right\. You too, Mihono-chan; be sure your hat doesn't get swept off\. Though, the air is nice and clear up here too\.  
**Mihono:** Yeah, it might be cold, but getting to see the sunset so clearly is the best\! Oh yeah\! Chii-nee, let's take a picture\!  
**Chie:** Another picture\? You've been taking them nonstop ever since this morning\.  
**Mihono:** We're on a big trip together, so don't you want to have a bunch of things to remember it by\? Kiyoka, could you take our picture with my phone\?  
**Kiyoka:** I don't mind, but, Hono-chan, with all the pictures you're taking, your phone must be running out of space, right\? I'll take it on my phone and send it to you later\.  
**Mihono:** You will\? Thanks\. That's a big help-\.  
**Kiyoka:** Okay, Hono-chan, Setouchi-san, please come up with a pose\!  
**Chie:** Umm, a pose\.\.\. What should we\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** If you want to give off a fun mood, how about if you do something like throwing both hands up in the air\?  
**Mihono:** Like this\? Banzai-\!  
**Kiyoka:** Yeah, that's great, Hono-chan\! Though, you still had your phone in your hand\.\.\. Next, how about you stay just like that, but hold each other's hands\?  
**Mihono:** That might look good\! Come on, hold my hand, Chii-nee\! Yayyy\!  
**Mihono:** WAH---- What do I do\!\? I dropped my phone\!  
**Chie:** Eh-\!\? You mean right now, when we held hands\?  
**Mihono:** I think so\. It's not on the floor here, so don't tell me\.\.\.  
**Yume:** You were swinging your hands all around, Onee-san, so I think it might've fallen all the way off the deck\.  
**Mihono:** No way\.\.\.  
**Sanae:** This observation tower is a hundred meters up off the ground too\. There's a cliff below us, so I don't think it could have hit anybody, but if it hit the rocks down there, it would have broken for sure\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** I don't believe it\.\.\. And I took so many pictures all day too-\. Uuu\.\.\. How could something like this happen\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** Hono-chan, sorry\. This all happened because I got carried away and asked you to do poses\.  
**Mihono:** It's not your fault, Kiyoka\. I was the one who let go because I wasn't careful\.  
**Mihono:** Sigh\.\.\. For me to mess up this bad at the very very end of the year; my luck is the worst\.  
**Chie:** Don't look so sad, Mihono-chan\. We might not be able to get the pictures back, but because of you, I've been having lots of fun all day\.  
**Chie:** All the memories are right here in my heart, so it's fine\. Here, raise up your head\. We can still make plenty more memories together from now on\.  
**Mihono:** Chii-nee\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** Ahh, the closeness between those two\. It kind of makes you feel like tearing up, doesn't it\?  
**Sanae:** I know\. That closeness itself might be the best takeaway from this trip\.\.\.  
**Yume:** Hey, hey, somebody's phone's been ringing\. It's ruining the mood\. Whose is it\?  
**Chie:** It isn't mine\. \.\.\.Hm\? Mihono-chan, isn't the ringing coming from behind you\?  
**Mihono:** Huh\? Now that you say it, I think so\. But, my phone fell down the cliff\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** Wait\! Hono-chan, isn't there something in the hood of your parka\?  
**Mihono:** Whoa-\! It's my phone\! It didn't fall down the cliff; it fell into my hood\.  
**Sanae:** I can hardly believe it\. But, isn't that great for you, Asakura-san\.  
**Mihono:** Yeah, and it seems like all my photos are safe too\. Sorry for making all of you worry, guys\!  
**Yume:** Good for you\. But, wouldn't you normally notice if something fell into your hood, Onee-san\?  
**Mihono:** I had no idea when it happened\.\.\.  
**Chie:** You might not have been able to notice in the panic after you dropped it\. But, I'm glad to see you're back to your happy self, Mihono-chan\.  
**Sanae:** By the way, your phone has been ringing for a while, hasn't it\? Who's trying to get a hold of you\?  
**Mihono:** Ahhh\! Yui sent me all these texts\!  
**Kiyoka:** \"Where's those lovey dovey shots of you two you promised\?\" \"The sun is already setting\" \"Hurry up-\!\" it says\. Do you have to text her back\?  
**Mihono:** That reminds me, I did promise I'd send her pictures of Chii-nee and me together\.  
**Mihono:** But, all I took were normal pictures of us having fun sightseeing, so it's probably not anything like what Yui's expecting\.  
**Kiyoka:** Fufu, in that case, I'll take one for you now\. Hono-chan, hug up nice and close against Setouchi-san\. Press your cheeks together too, and it'll look extra lovey dovey\!  
**Mihono:** I-I can't do that out of nowhere-\! It'd be embarrassing, right, Chii-nee\?  
**Chie:** Well, it is a little embarrassing, but since we are on a big trip, it might be nice to have photos like this too\.  
**Mihono:** I guess so\.\.\. Then, when in Rome\! [hug-\]\!  
**Kiyoka:** Yeah, that pose looks perfect\! I'm taking the picture now\. Say cheese\!
