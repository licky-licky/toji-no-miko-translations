5-8.1 One With the Flame
========================

## 1: To Save Mihono (1\)
**Mihono:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Chie:** We finally found her\.\.\.  
**Chie:** Mihono-chan\!\!  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** Is that Kanayamahime\.\.\.\?  
**Chie:** When it happened to you, Juujou-san, you were still conscious, weren't you\!\? So what's going on with Mihono-chan\!\?  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.This is different from what I went through\. Probably closer to what happened with Tagitsuhime and Origami Yukari\.  
**Hiyori:** Mihono's consciousness should be trapped up by Kanayamahime\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** But I don't see Kanayamahime in there either\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** Then we'll just have to feel her out sword to sword\.  
**Kanami:** Give me a response, Kanayamahime\!  

## 2: To Save Mihono (2\)
**Mihono:** AAAAAAAAAAAGGGHHHHHH\!\!  
**Hiyori:** Kanami\.  
**Kanami:** \.\.\.Yeah\. That footwork just now was Shingyoto-ryu\. But\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** GAAAAAAAAHHHHH\!\!  
**Kanami:** I'm not feeling anything from her swordfighting\.\.\.  
**Mai:** You mean, her body is just moving from memory\.\.\.\?  
**Kofuki:** Oi oi\.\.\. I've gone up against Mihocchi when she's serious a couple times, but this's on another level\.  
**Mihono:** AAAAAAAAAAGGHHHH\!\!  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.\! If she got the name -hime, Kanayamahime has to be past a certain level of intelligence\.  
**Kiyoka:** But it doesn't seem like we can get through to her if she just keeps acting wild\!  
**Yui:** So then, is Kanayamahime even fully awake\.\.\.\? Or am I being too optimistic\?  
**Ellen:** We came here riding on a one in a million hope\. That's plenty for us\!  
**Nene:** Nene\!  
**Kaoru:** Oi, don't go out there\! You're gonna get hurt\!  
**Kaoru:** Seriously\.\.\. So, what's the plan\?  
**Kanami:** If Kanayamahime hasn't fully woken up, couldn't we get Mihono-chan conscious again\?  
**Chie:** Could we still do that\!\?  
**Hiyori:** It's possible\.  
**Hiyori:** But that'll depend on whether Mihono has the willpower left to fight off Kanayamahime\.\.\.  
**Chie:** \.\.\.Mihono-chan wouldn't ever give up\.  
**Chie:** If there's a chance, I'll do anything\! What do you need from me\?  
**Hiyori:** All you can do is keep calling out to her while we wear down Kanayamahime's strength\.  
**Hana:** And if Kanayamahime wakes all the way up, then what\?  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.If that happens\.\.\. We just have to try talking Kanayamahime down\.  
**Kaoru:** So what, we ask her to give Mihono back\? Let's hope she's the understanding type\.  
**Ellen:** Don't be like that, Kaoru\. If we want to save Mihomiho, all we can do is give this a shot\!  

## 3: I'll Save Her (1\)
**Mihono:** GAAAAAAGGHHH\!  
**Kanami:** HAH\!  
**Hiyori:** Gh\!\!  
**Akira:** \.\.\.Good, it's not over yet\.  
**Yui:** Boss\.\.\.  
**Akira:** You here too, Yui\?  
**Akira:** And\.\.\.  
**Hana:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Akira:** These're some familiar faces\. Though, one of us is\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** GRAAAAAAAAAGGHHH\!  
**Akira:** \.\.\.It's just like I told you\.\.\.  
**Yui:** Boss\?  
**Akira:** Forget it\. So right now, you're swapping off trying to wear Kanayamahime out\.\.\.\?  
**Akira:** Let me through\.  
**Akira:** You're not gonna be able to save Mihono\. I can help her, so swap with me\.  
**Yui:** You mean you can\!\? Boss, you can save Mihono-chan\.\.\.\!  
**Akira:** \.\.\.\.\.\.Yeah\.  
**Akira:** I'll be the one to do it\.  
**Yui:** Boss\?  
**Hana:** Stop her, Yui\!  
**Yui:** Huh\?  
**Akira:** --\!  
**Ellen:** STOP\!  
**Akira:** Gh\!\?  
**Ellen:** This road's closed, Akira\.  
**Akira:** --\!\?  
**Kaoru:** Don't go\.\.\. playing cool\!  
**Akira:** So it's Ellen and Kaoru first\.\.\.  
**Yui:** H-Hey, what're you doing\!\? Boss said she's going to save Mihono-chan\.\.\.  
**Hana:** Not like that, Yui\. That's not\.\.\. how she's going to save her\.  
**Kaoru:** Right\?  
**Kaoru:** You're gonna kill Mihono, aren't you\?  
**Akira:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** You're not going to hurt Mihomiho\. You'll have to get through us, Akira\.  
**Akira:** \.\.\.I won't go easy\. You better be ready to lose a couple arms\!  
**Kaoru:** Same to you\!  
**Yui:** But, why, Boss\!\? You and Mihono-chan were\.\.\.  
**Akira:** \.\.\.That's why\.  
**Akira:** That's why\.\.\. I'll be the one to make this right\!\!  
**Kaoru:** Let's go, Ellen\! Don't let her get Mihono\!  
**Ellen:** Yes\!  
**Akira:** Come on then\!\!  

## 4: I'll Save Her (2\)
**Chie:** Stop\!  
**Ellen:** Chie\?  
**Chie:** \.\.\.Help us, Inago-san\.  
**Kaoru:** The hell are you talking about\!\? She came here to kill Mihono\!  
**Chie:** I said we'd handle it\.\.\. But all I ever did was talk; I couldn't do anything for her\.\.\.  
**Chie:** So\.\.\. talking isn't going to be enough right now\! Help us, Inago-san\!  
**Akira:** \.\.\.Give it up\.  
**Akira:** After she's that far gone\.\.\. we don't have a way to save her either\.  
**Akira:** The only way to free her from that is to cut her down and exorcise her\.  
**Chie:** You're wrong\! Kanayamahime still hasn't fully awakened yet\!   
**Chie:** This is\.\.\. our one and only chance\!  
**Akira:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Akira:** \.\.\.\.\.\.It's not happening\.  
**Chie:** Because Makoto ordered you not to\?  
**Chie:** But still\.\.\. Makoto doesn't want this either, does she\?  
**Akira:** You think you know Makocchan\.\.\.\?  
**Chie:** I do know her\.\.\. Because she hasn't changed\.  
**Chie:** She's kind hearted, and stubborn\.\.\.  
**Chie:** Which is why I can tell\.  
**Chie:** Makoto would never want to have to make a sacrifice out of Mihono-chan\!  
**Chie:** After how much she cried when Miyako gave up her future as a toji\.\.\. deep down, she'd never want to sacrifice anyone\!  
**Akira:** \.\.\.You've got that right\.  
**Akira:** But then, you get this too, don't you\?  
**Akira:** She already made up her mind\.  
**Chie:** But\.\.\.  
**Akira:** Yeah, Makocchan's stubborn as hell\. Once she settles on something, she never backs down\.  
**Akira:** And I'm right there with her\!  
**Mirja:** In that case, we'll offer something that would persuade Hitakami Makoto as well\.  
**Akira:** I'm not letting you waste any more time\!  
**Mirja:** Grh\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.We'll have Asakura Mihono participate in your research\.  
**Akira:** \.\.\.What\?  
**Chie:** Mirja\!\?  
**Mirja:** That's the compromise we'll need to make, Setouchi Chie\.  
**Mirja:** What do you say\?  
**Akira:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** Then, one more thing\. If you're concerned for your future, you should take our side\.  
**Akira:** \.\.\.What's that supposed to mean\?  
**Mirja:** Let's assume you destroy Kanayamahime and Asakura Mihono with her\.  
**Mirja:** The general populace and many toji will likely turn a blind eye to Asakura Mihono's sacrifice\.  
**Mirja:** However\.\.\. It's not going to sit right with those who knew her personally\.  
**Mirja:** And Asakura Mihono has a way of getting to know people\. I think you might be surprised just how many that could be\?  
**Akira:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** If you hope to keep the reputation of tamayori toji stable, you'd be better off having tried to save Asakura Mihono\.  
**Mirja:** Am I wrong\?  
**Akira:** You sure are a smooth talker\.  
**Akira:** \.\.\.I've got one condition\.  
**Chie:** \.\.\.Are you really\.\.\. helping us\?  
**Akira:** It's not like I'm going against what Makocchan said to do\.  
**Chie:** Thank you\!  
**Akira:** Don't thank me yet\!  
**Akira:** If I decide Mihono's past the point of saving, I'm killing her\. Got that\?
