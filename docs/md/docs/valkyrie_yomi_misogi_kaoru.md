## [Valkyrie - Yomi: Start]: A Sudden Call from Akira
**Akira:** Oiii, Yomi\! Here, over here\~\.  
**Yomi:** I could tell where you were without you having to shout.  
**Akira:** You just looked like you were kinda spacing out over there. Anyway, ready to go?  
**Yomi:** I was wondering where you were taking me. A cakery?  
**Akira:** What's wrong with that? The limited run parfaits this place makes get a lot of talk for being good.  
**Yomi:** You still like parfaits like you used to.  
**Yomi:** So, what was the reason you called me here for?  
**Akira:** I had a little something to take care of around here. So I thought I'd give you a call. It's no fun eating by yourself, right?  
**Yomi:** ......  
**Akira:** I know you've probably got a lot going on too, but you've gotta take a breather every now and then.  
**Yomi:** I have to be part of a promotional photo shoot later today, so I can't stay here for very long.  
**Akira:** Huhh? What're you doing a photo shoot for?  
**Yomi:** You could say it has to do with the results of the Miss Five Traditions competition that was held the other day, I suppose.  
**Akira:** Ahh, oh yeah, they put those out, huh.  
**Akira:** That reminds me, didn't you place pretty high yourself? I was surprised to hear it. I never thought you'd be up there.  
**Akira:** Though, it must be boring as hell to sit through some photo shoot cause of it.  
**Yomi:** I can't neglect this, considering it's part of my duties as a toji.  
**Akira:** You got so straight laced. But, if that's what you're set on. You better do it right.  
**Akira:** You gonna be doing it in your uniform? They'd probably get mad if you wore something too casual; so a jacket like mine's out.  
**Yomi:** You're probably right. Though, this time it's arranged for me to wear a valkyrie themed costume, along with Tsubakuro-san and the others.  
**Akira:** ......  
**Akira:** What're you talking about?  
**Yomi:** You may not know about it, Akira, but valkyries were something that was part of Norse mythology--  
**Akira:** It's not like I don't know what valkyries are...\! I'm asking, why're they making you dress up like that...\!\?  
**Yomi:** That's what I'd like to know.  
**Akira:** Yeah, I guess... The bureau does say to do some ridiculous stuff sometimes, huh.  
**Akira:** ...Well, do what you can. Whatever you're buying here'll be my treat.  
**Yomi:** Then, I'll have some tea. The black tea here is fairly good; it goes well with sweet foods.  
**Akira:** I'll have the same thing you're drinking then.  
**Akira:** Ah, when you get the photos back, lemme see. Those'll be fun to look through for sure.  

## [Valkyrie - Yomi: End]: This One is My Favorite
**Akira:** Yo\! It's rare for you to call me to hang out.  
**Yomi:** I got the photos back from that photo shoot we spoke about the other day.  
**Yomi:** I think they'll be published online soon, but I had heard you were coming by on an assignment.  
**Akira:** Cool; let me just put my bike away. Wait here a minute.  
**Akira:** So, how'd that photo shoot turn out anyway?  
**Yomi:** Like this.  
**Akira:** Whoa-\!\? The hell... You're looking way too cool in this.  
**Akira:** That sharp look on your face is great. It came out really damn nice.  
**Yomi:** I didn't expect you to praise it so much.  
**Akira:** Why not? Of course I would if it turned out this good.  
**Yomi:** That's true. Though, I expected you to make fun of me.  
**Akira:** Yeah, if I'm being honest, I was planning to, until I actually saw this. This whole valkyrie thing came out of nowhere.  
**Akira:** But this seems like it'll get some attention. Especially if Tsubakuro Yume and Kanami and the others are doing it.  
**Akira:** You got any other shots of you in this?  
**Yomi:** No. This is the only one I brought with me.  
**Akira:** That's too bad. I really like the look of this one.  
**Yomi:** I see. I wasn't sure which photo to bring myself, so the others in the special defense team picked it out for me.  
**Akira:** Huh. Didn't think you were so close with them, Yomi.  
**Akira:** Does that mean you're pushing omusubi on them too?  
**Yomi:** Sometimes... I do.  
**Akira:** The omusubi you make are weirdly good, y'know. Somehow, just talking about them made me hungry.  
**Akira:** I'm thinking of getting something to eat here, but, what about you?  
**Yomi:** I'd like to join you, but I've already made plans.  
**Akira:** With the special defense team?  
**Yomi:** Yes.  
**Akira:** Guess there's no helping that. We didn't get to see each other much, but I had fun today.  
**Yomi:** I did too. Then, until next time.  
**Akira:** She's working real hard for her buddies, huh.  
**Akira:** Alright... I've gotta stick to it too.

## [Misogi - Kaoru: Start]: A Little About the Past
**Kaoru:** Today's kinda hot, isn't it-... My water bottle's already run dry...  
**Nene:** Ne\~\~\...  
**Ellen:** I only have a little bit left in mine, but, want to drink it, Kaoru?  
**Kaoru:** Gladly. Or at least, I'd want to, but, if you ran out of yours, that'd be bad too.  
**Ellen:** Should we make a trip back to town then? We'd be losing a lot of time though.  
**Chie:** Ellen-san, Kaoru-san. It's alright. I brought lots of drinks with me.  
**Ellen:** Chie, thank you so much\!  
**Kaoru:** It's nice somebody came prepared. You really saved us. [gulp gulp]... Phwah. Can't thank you enough.  
**Chie:** It's just a part of me acting as everyone's onee-san.  
**Ellen:** Have you been an onee-san ever since you were a little girl, Chie?  
**Chie:** When I was little, I spent most of my time together with Mihono-chan, so it's true that back then I wanted to try hard to act as an onee-san.  
**Chie:** Though I'm not sure it went too well at first.  
**Kaoru:** Well, there's no way you could've been the same as a kid. But we all depend on you the way you are now.  
**Ellen:** That's right; Chie's our reliable onee-san.  
**Ellen:** By the way, I've never really asked you about it before, Kaoru, but, what were you like as a little girl?  
**Chie:** Ah, I'd like to hear about that too.  
**Kaoru:** Give me a break...  
**Ellen:** Don't be like that. Do it for meee.  
**Nene:** Nenenene\~\. Ne\~ne.  
**Chie:** Nene-chan's asking for it too, see?  
**Kaoru:** Kh... Letting her hold you like that; you're totally on her side now...  
**Kaoru:** I'll tell you about it, but it's not all that interesting, okay?  
**Ellen:** I don't believe that for a minute, Kaoru\! I have a feeling this'll be very interesting\!  
**Kaoru:** Anyway, when I was little, I was a real brat. I used to play with kids around the neighborhood, and I sorta ended up in the position of leading them around.  
**Chie:** That's a little unexpected.  
**Kaoru:** It just sort of happened after I'd stand up for the ones who got left out or got messed with.  
**Kaoru:** Maybe it's cause I was hooked on the heroes you'd see in tokusatsu shows-.  
**Nene:** Nene\!  
**Ellen:** You still like tokusatsu heroes now too, don't you, Kaoru-. Did aim towards becoming a toji ever since back then?  
**Kaoru:** I guess-. I know you know, but the Mashikos are a toji family, so my mom and grandma were both toji too. I respected it because of that, or maybe looked up to it.  
**Kaoru:** Becoming a toji meant you got to defeat aradama, after all.  
**Ellen:** What else were you like?  
**Kaoru:** What else-; when I was a kid, I played with my grandpa a lot too. I always felt at ease being around him.  
**Ellen:** Since I love my grandpa too, that makes us the same\~\.  
**Chie:** I'd imagine you always got along with Nene-chan too, right?  
**Nene:** Ne\!  
**Kaoru:** About Nene...  
**Ellen:** Before we can talk about that, it looks like we've got work to do. There's a reading on the spectrum finder.  
**Kaoru:** Guess we'd better hurry-.  
**Nene:** Nene\~\!  

## [Misogi - Kaoru: End]: Together With Nene
**Ellen:** Kaoru\! Behind you\!  
**Aradama:** KSHAAAAAA\!  
**Kaoru:** \!\?  
**Nene:** NENE--\!\!  
**Aradama:** GGGII...\!  
**Nene:** Ne\! Nenene-- NEEEE-......  
**Chie:** Nene-chan\!\?  
**Kaoru:** Damnit...\!\!  
**Kaoru:** Outta my way\! KIEEEEEEEEEEEEE\!\!  
**Kaoru:** Is Nene okay\!\?  
**Nene:** ......  
**Ellen:** You can relax, Kaoru. He's only passed out.  
**Kaoru:** Oh...  
**Chie:** You really do treasure Nene-chan, don't you.  
**Kaoru:** He's family. I don't want him to get hurt anymore.  
**Kaoru:** All the more because, in the past, I hurt Nene once...  
**Chie:** Eh...?  
**Ellen:** Something like that happened between you and Nene...?  
**Kaoru:** I told you before, I looked up to toji. But, there was also a time I didn't want to be a Mashiko toji.  
**Kaoru:** I'm not proud of it, but that was my rebellious phase.  
**Kaoru:** ...I didn't want to work as a toji who killed aradama, so I hated it.  
**Kaoru:** But, since I was a girl from the Mashiko family... There's no way I could just not be one. It's not like I could go against Grandma and everybody.  
**Kaoru:** ...So I got way too fed up with it and started lashing out.  
**Kaoru:** ...Seeing me taking my anger out on stuff, Nene came and tried to calm me down... I hit him by mistake.  
**Kaoru:** And... really hard, too...  
**Chie:** That's...  
**Ellen:** Kaoru...  
**Nene:** ......  
**Kaoru:** If people won't get hurt, wouldn't it be fine to let aradama be around?  
**Kaoru:** I want to make the world a place where nobody hates aradama, including this guy here.  
**Ellen:** I see. I completely agree with that viewpoint of yours, Kaoru\!  
**Chie:** A world where neither aradama or people hurt each other... I'd like that to be a reality someday.  
**Ellen:** And, as a symbol of that, when the time comes, let's make an Aradama Park\!  
**Chie:** Eh?  
**Kaoru:** Kuku... Now there's an idea. We can quit being toji and kick back and relax at Aradama Park.  
**Chie:** I smell trouble brewing...  
**Nene:** ...Ne?  
**Kaoru:** Oh, you're up? You overslept a little, but I'll forgive you this once.  
**Nene:** Nee??  
**Kaoru:** You're gonna be the park's main attraction, after all. We'll be in trouble if you aren't in your best shape, Nene.  
**Nene:** Nene-\!
