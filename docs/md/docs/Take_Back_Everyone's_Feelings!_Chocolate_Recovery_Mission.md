## 1: The Disappearing Chocolate
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.It's already been a week since Valentines\.  
**Hiyori:** I tried making that \"friendship chocolate\" Ellen and Mai told me about, but\.\.\. I never managed to give it to Kanami\.  
**Hiyori:** If only I'd said it was thanks for all the help she's given me\.\.\. Then I could have casually handed it to her\.  
**Hiyori:** But now it's too late\. I'll just eat those chocolates\.  
**Hiyori:** Hm\? I know I left the box around here\.  
**Hiyori:** Wait\.\.\. Was it my bag\?  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.Where did it go\?  
**Hiyori:** What if\.\.\. I dropped it somewhere\!\?  
**Hiyori:** This isn't good\.\.\. I left a message in it\. I stayed up late worrying over what to write, and I get the feeling\.\.\. I might have said too much\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** No, I can't have written anything that serious\.\.\. But, if anyone saw it\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** Ooh\. I never thought you'd write something like that\.  
**Kaoru:** No no, I think it's great\. (grin\)  
**Hiyori:** Kh\.\.\. I have to find it right now-\!  
**Hiyori:** It wasn't turned into the lost and found\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** Oh, Hiyori-chan\! Did you hear\? The chocolate\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** \!\? \.\.\.K-Kanami\.  
**Kanami:** What's wrong\? Why'd you jump like that\?  
**Hiyori:** N-No reason\.\.\. More importantly, what was that about chocolate\?  
**Kanami:** Right, there's been a ton of cases of aradama stealing chocolate\!  
**Hiyori:** Huh\?  
**Kanami:** It's just like it sounds; aradama are stealing chocolate\.  
**Kanami:** Not too long ago they were going after factories and stores that had chocolate\.\.\. I wonder why\?  
**Hiyori:** (Then the culprit\.\.\. Was an aradama-\!\?\)  
**Kanami:** They took the chocolates Mai-chan gave to Sayaka-chan too\.  
**Sayaka:** Mm\. I was eating them bit by bit\. There were still a lot left\.  
**Kanami:** I ate all mine right away, so I don't have anything to worry about\. But it must have been a shock when they vanished like that\.  
**Sayaka:** I should have eaten mine too\. But I'll get Mai's chocolates back for sure\.  
**Hiyori:** Right, we have to get them back\!  
**Kanami:** You had yours taken too, Hiyori-chan\? I'll help you out\!  
**Hiyori:** Th-Thank you\. By the way, did anyone else lose theirs\?  
**Kanami:** Well, apparently Shidou-san got a ton of chocolates, but then the whole thing was stolen\. I think she was the first person to report it happening\.  
**Hiyori:** Did she really get that much\.\.\.\?  
**Kanami:** There's a lot of girls out there who are fans of Shidou-san\.  
**Sayaka:** \.\.\.A message came in about a mission\.  
**Kanami:** Looks like a response to the chocolate stealing aradama\.  
**Hiyori:** We should go, Kanami, Sayaka\.  

## 2: Recover the Chocolate\!
**Maki:** Continuing since the other day, aradama targeting chocolate have appeared\. This time it seems they aren't after packaging materials, but the chocolate itself\.  
**Maki:** Due to the large stores of chocolate, they should have caused considerable damage in the area of this shopping mall\.  
**Maki:** We're going to sweep through the aradama around here, and rescue that chocolate\!  
**Kanami:** What's with Shidou-san\? She seems more motivated than usual, doesn't she\?  
**Sayaka:** \.\.\.Shidou Maki, do you like chocolate\?  
**Maki:** Ah, I do, but more than that, chocolate from someone important to me went missing\. So I might be a little worked up about getting it back\.  
**Maki:** There's more for me to explain\. From the reports of toji who have already been dealing with this issue, it's been confirmed that defeated aradama are in fact dropping chocolate\.  
**Maki:** On this mission, in addition to suppressing aradama and gathering their chocolate\.\.\.  You will be competing over the amount of chocolate you can recover, and the result will be reflected on your grades this term\.  
**Maki:** Additionally, if you encounter any other toji on this mission, you will have a practice match with them\. The winner of that match will also be reflected on your grades\.  
**Maki:** On top of that, if you encounter another toji during the mission, go ahead and and face off against them\. The outcome of your match will also be considered on your grades\.  
**Maki:** The presidents of the Five Traditions have agreed on this matter\. It may seem difficult, but I'd like for you to give your best efforts exterminating these aradama\.  
**Kofuki:** Graded on matches\? Way to spoil the fun\.\.\.  
**Kofuki:** But I guess even if I half-ass it, I still get my fill of cutting up aradama-chan out there\!  
**Kiyoka:** So basically, the usual for you, Kofuki-san\. If we're being graded on this, then I need to try a little harder too\.  
**Kanami:** Hey, I have a question\! What do we do with the chocolate we recover\?  
**Suzuka:** The chocolate taken by aradama is considered unfit for sale, so we will be disposing of it\.  
**Suzuka:** However, if the person it belongs to can be determined from a name or message included with the chocolate, we will try to return it to them\.  
**Hiyori:** (They'll be reading messages\.\.\.\? Then I have to get to that chocolate before anyone else does\.\)  
**Kanami:** Can we eat the chocolate that gets recovered\?  
**Sayaka:** I was wondering that too\.  
**Maki:** According to the analysis provided by Ban Tsugumi, they should be safe to eat\.  
**Maki:** It'd be a problem for me too if they were inedible\. After you worked so hard, Suzuka\.\.\.  
**Suzuka:** Maki-san\. Don't you think it's about time we got the mission underway\?  
**Maki:** Yeah, you're right\. Then, begin clearing the area of aradama\!  
**Maki:** HAAAHH-\!\!  
**Maki:** I've found some of the chocolates that were given to me, but\.\.\. No sign of the ones Suzuka made\.  
**Suzuka:** If only you had eaten them\. You ate some of the chocolates the other girls gave you, didn't you\?  
**Maki:** Sorry\. It just somehow felt like a waste to eat yours\.  
**Suzuka:** It wasn't something you needed to be so appreciative of\.  
**Maki:** That's not true\. What you gave me was special\. It was handmade, after all\.  
**Suzuka:** \.\.\.Honestly\. There you go again\. [muttered\]  
**Suzuka:** If that's how you feel, then do your best to find it\.  
**Maki:** Of course, I will\.  
**Kiyoka:** \.\.\.I did it\! Ah, this one's all wrapped up\.  
**Hiyori:** Kiyoka\. Sorry, but could you let me see that chocolate\?  
**Kiyoka:** Does this chocolate belong to you, Juujou-san\?  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.Doesn't seem like it\. Thanks\.  
**Kiyoka:** You already recovered a lot of chocolate, didn't you, Juujou-san\?  
**Kanami:** I know, right\! I'm impressed, Hiyori-chan\.  
**Hiyori:** Yes, well, this is just part of our duty as toji\.  
**Hiyori:** (They still haven't found it\.\.\. I shouldn't get impatient\. So long as Kanami or our friends don't collect it, I should be able to work something out\.\.\.\)  
**Kanami:** Okay, I'm going to try my hardest not to lose to you, Hiyori-chan\!  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  

## 3: There's Only One Chocolate I Want
**Mai:** We've gathered quite a lot of chocolate, haven't we\.  
**Suzuka:** There are several highly motivated toji working to recover it, after all\.  
**Mai:** Like Kanami-chan, Hiyori-chan, and Sayaka-chan\?  
**Suzuka:** Maki-san as well\. The amount those four have found is head and shoulders above the rest\.  
**Suzuka:** Though, with everyone's hard work,  we collected more chocolate than we anticipated\. It's unfortunate we had to ask to take up space in this store for the time being\.  
**Sayaka:** Mai, I brought chocolate\.  
**Mai:** Good work, Sayaka-chan\. Why not take a little break\?  
**Sayaka:** But\.\.\. I still haven't found Mai's chocolate\.  
**Mai:** You don't have to worry about that\. I can always make more chocolate for you\.  
**Mai:** And anyway, even though they said it was okay, wouldn't it be best if you didn't eat chocolate that came out of an aradama\?  
**Sayaka:** It's something Mai made for me, so I want to get it back\.  
**Mai:** Thank you, Sayaka\.  
**Sayaka:** Why are you thanking me\?  
**Mai:** It's hard to say, but just hearing that made me happy, I guess\?  
**Maki:** Sorry\. I brought back a load of chocolate, but can you keep these separate from the rest\?  
**Suzuka:** I'll look after them; it won't be a problem\. Were these ones sent to you\?  
**Maki:** Yeah, these ones were\. It'd be a big help if you could\.  
**Suzuka:** There's\.\.\. Quite a lot of them, aren't there\.  
**Maki:** I'm glad I managed to get them back, after they went through the trouble of gifting them to me\.  
**Suzuka:** I'm sure\.  
**Maki:** \.\.\.Anyway, I'm going back to suppressing aradama\. If a large group of aradama comes up, send me a message\.  
**Suzuka:** If she'd only ask, I'd gladly make more chocolate for her\.  
**Hiyori:** Even after all I've gathered, there's still no sign of that chocolate\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** Hey, Hiyori-chan\! Just look at all the chocolate you found\. How many aradama did you beat for it\?  
**Hiyori:** Honestly\.\.\. I lost count\.  
**Kanami:** Ehehe, me too, actually\. It's all good so long as we get a lot of chocolate back\.  
**Kanami:** See, look how much I got\? If I had to buy this much, I'd be all out of spending money\.  
**Hiyori:** That is a lot\. Mind if I look through it\?  
**Kanami:** Sure\? But, why\?  
**Hiyori:** I'll owe you one\. If this chocolate I'm looking for is in there, that is\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** Hiyori-chan, would you like regular chocolate without the mint too\?  
**Hiyori:** It's not like I dislike it\. It's a vital part of chocolate mint, after all\.  
**Hiyori:** (Good\.\.\. Kanami doesn't seem to have found it\. But still, I have to find it fast\.\.\.\)  
**Kanami:** Then, I'll give you some chocolate I reccomend later\. Mihono-chan showed it to me recently\.  
**Hiyori:** I'm looking forward to it\. But for now, there's aradama to deal with\.  
**Hiyori:** (If I can't find that chocolate meant for Kanami\.\.\.\)  
**Sayaka:** (If I can't find Mai's chocolate\.\.\.\)  
**Maki:** (If I can't find Suzuka's chocolate\.\.\.\)  
**Hiyori/Sayaka/Maki:** (I'll just have to kill every last aradama\!\)  

## 4: How Does the Chocolate Taste\?
**Kofuki:** What the hell, I thought I'd sliced up the most aradama-chan, but four people got ranked higher than me\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** I think 5th place is still pretty amazing\!  
**Kofuki:** I guess, but that just means they stole that many aradama-chan from me\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** There's no way you can call that stealing though\.  
**Kiyoka:** More importantly, Kofuki-san\? Did you eat the chocolate I gave you\?  
**Kofuki:** Yep\. That stuff was pretty good\. Thanks\.  
**Kiyoka:** Fufu\. I'm glad to hear it then\. It was worth it after all\.  
**Sayaka:** I like the chocolates you make too, Mai\.  
**Mai:** Ah, don't eat it all now, Sayaka-chan\. Save some for later\.  
**Sayaka:** But, I don't want them to get stolen again\.  
**Mai:** It's okay\. If that happens, I'll make you another batch\.  
**Sayaka:** Then, I feel better\. Do you want to eat some, Mai\?  
**Mai:** Okay\. I'll have one\.  
**Sayaka:** There's something I want to try\.\.\. Say \"ahhh\"\.  
**Mai:** \.\.\.\!  
**Mai:** A-Alright\. Ahhhm\.\.\.  
**Mai:** \.\.\.Even though I made these, it tastes so strange\.\.\.  
**Sayaka:** Really\? It tastes good to me\. Do you want to eat another one\?  
**Mai:** \.\.\.That's okay\! You can have the rest, Sayaka-chan\.  
**Sayaka:** Mm\.\.\. I really like these\.  
**Maki:** You did good work today, Suzuka\.  
**Suzuka:** Not as much as you, Maki-san\. You worked hard, running all about\.  
**Maki:** I guess you're right\. But with the support you gave me, I could focus everything on fighting\.  
**Suzuka:** You had something you were searching for, Maki-san\.  
**Maki:** And thanks to you, I found it\. With the mission finished, I think I'll have them right now\.  
**Suzuka:** (\.\.\.I never expected to see her eating them in person\. I did test the taste thoroughly, so there should be no issue\.\.\.\)  
**Maki:** Here they are\.  
**Maki:** Mm\! It's delicious\.\.\. These are delicious, Suzuka\.  
**Suzuka:** Fufu, I'm glad to hear it suits your tastes, Maki-san\.  
**Maki:** Since you're an ojou-sama, I figured you wouldn't be used to it, but it turns out you're perfect when it comes to cooking too\.  
**Suzuka:** P-Perfect\? You're just flattering me\.  
**Maki:** No, that's how I really feel\. I'll have to come up with a good return gift for these\.  
**Suzuka:** I'll very much look forward to it\.  
**Hiyori:** Kh\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** (I never did find that chocolate\.\.\. It would be hard to ask if there was any chocolate directed to Kanami, so there's nothing I can do\.\.\.\)  
**Hiyori:** (What if it's still somewhere in my room\? Ahh, that must be what happened\!\)  
**Kanami:** Hmm, who's this chocolate from\? Mai-chan gave it to me, since it has my name on it, but\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** \! That's\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.I'll just have to own up\. Sorry, Kanami\. Can I talk to you\?  
**Kanami:** What is it, Hiyori-chan\?  
**Hiyori:** That chocolate\.\.\. It's from me\.  
**Hiyori:** On Valentines Day\.\.\. I was going to give it to you, but it was too awkward, so I never did\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** I know it's a week late, but, will you accept it\?  
**Kanami:** Sure\! Though, I'd rather have you actually give it to me\. Here\.  
**Hiyori:** It feels sort of weird, giving back something that was just returned to me\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** Take this, Kanami\. Think of it as\.\.\. Thanks, for everything you do for me\.  
**Kanami:** Thank you\! Why don't we eat it together\!  
**Kanami:** Ah, I knew it, it's chocolate mint\!  
**Kanami:** Chew chew\.\.\. Hey, this is actually pretty good\?  
**Hiyori:** So you've started appreciating chocolate mint\? I knew you would come around\.  
**Kanami:** Oh, there's a little card tucked in here\.  
**Hiyori:** Wait\.\.\. Don't read that\!  
**Kanami:** Sorry, I already did\.  
**Kanami:** \"I depend on you as much as you depend on me\. You're always joining me in sparring sessions, after all\.\"  
**Kanami:** I feel the same way, and I'm glad we're friends\! Let's keep on depending on each other\!
