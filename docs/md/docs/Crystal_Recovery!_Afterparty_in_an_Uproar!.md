## 1: Afterparty in an Uproar\! Prologue
**Suzuka:** ...Phew, what a relief it is that the raffle competition has finished safely.  
**Suzuka:** I can breathe easy at last.  
**Yomi:** Good work, Konohana-san. We brought you a filling meal, so please rest a while.  
**Suzuka:** Would you look at that, omusubi and karaage.  
**Yume:** They're both really good, Suzuka-onee-san.  
**Yume:** But still, who decided on omusubi and karaage anyway? They could've gone with something like roast beef or pizza.  
**Suzuka:** Who could it have been, I wonder?  
**Suzuka:** ...My, they really are delicious. This omusubi tastes like the sort you make, Yomi-san.  
**Yomi:** It might have been out of line, but I did offer some advice to the staff.  
**Suzuka:** While you were working as party security?  
**Yomi:** I'm very sorry. I couldn't help myself...  
**Suzuka:** There's no reason to apologize. It's thanks to you that I'm able to eat such delicious omusubi now.  
**Yume:** That's right-\!  
**Yume:** I got really hungry while I was doing security, so I ate way too much.  
**Suzuka:** You were a great help with how seriously you decided to take your security role, Yume.  
**Yume:** There's something a little off about how you said that.  
**Yume:** Were you thinking that I'd stop helping with security and force my way into the raffle competition?  
**Suzuka:** Was I wrong in thinking it a possibility?  
**Suzuka:** I had made arrangements with the girls organizing the entertainment to deal with such an incident, if the need arose, but I'm thankful it didn't.  
**Yume:** You did\!\?  
**Yume:** Does that mean, if I'd forced my way in, I'd have gotten to fight that Chidori-onee-san\!\?  
**Yume:** Well I should have done it then-\!  
**Yomi:** Though, the raffle competition was only able to be safely carried out because you were suppressing any aradama, Tsubakuro-san.  
**Suzuka:** I'm proud of you, Yume.  
**Yume:** I didn't really do anything worth praising me for. Those aradama were so weak and all.  
**Suzuka:** Still... There were quite a lot more reports of aradama suppression than we initially expected.  
**Yomi:** Could they have been drawn to something?  
**Suzuka:** The aradama, you mean?  
**Yomi:** Yes.  
**Suzuka:** It's true that... In the past, we have identified aradama that have shown certain attachments to something or another...  
**Yume:** What if the aradama wanted to do the raffle too?  
**Yomi:** It may not have been the raffle. Large amounts of food and dresses were also prepared here.  
**Suzuka:** That's right, and there is one more item...  
**Kiyoka:** Th-Th-There's trouble\!  
**Hiyori:** Large amounts of aradama have broken into the campus\!  
**Suzuka:** Calm down\! Has it affected the party?  
**Hiyori:** There's no problem there. But, the aradama seem to be taking any kind of jewelry they find.  
**Suzuka:** Could it be... The crystal jewelry adorned on the tiaras\!\?  
**Yomi:** Tiaras? Why would that...  
**Yume:** Who cares about why\!  
**Yume:** I'm all full now, so I could use some exercise.  
**Hiyori:** What should we do, Konohana Suzuka?  
**Suzuka:** That goes without saying.  
**Suzuka:** Those of us here will neutralize the aradama, and recover those jewels\!  

## 2: Afterparty in an Uproar\! Epilogue
**Suzuka:** Good work, all of you.  
**Suzuka:** Thanks to your efforts, we've recovered the jewelry.  
**Yomi:** Konohana-san. You said something about a tiara...  
**Suzuka:** That's right... I suppose the best introduction would be to show you all the items in question.  
**Suzuka:** Come this way.  
**Yume:** Uwah\! Did you bring all these tiaras here, Suzuka-onee-san?  
**Suzuka:** Yes, of course.  
**Kiyoka:** They're so pretty... These... They're real, aren't they?  
**Hiyori:** There's so many of them... Enough for everyone? Why though?  
**Suzuka:** So the toji, who are so used to fighting, might have a chance to pretty themselves up.  
**Suzuka:** And, if we're giving them a taste of another world, there's no harm in going all out, is there?  
**Yume:** Ooh ooh\! Suzuka-onee-san\! I wanna wear a tiara\!  
**Suzuka:** Thanks to all your efforts, we can distribute these to everyone.  
**Suzuka:** Here you are, Yume.  
**Yume:** Ahaha\! How do I look, Yomi-onee-san?  
**Yomi:** Tsubakuro-san, if you move around too much, it will slip... It is slipping off.  
**Yume:** Eh, it is\!\?  
**Yomi:** Please stay still for a moment. I will put it back in place.  
**Yomi:** ...That should do it.  
**Yume:** Thanks, Yomi-onee-san\!  
**Suzuka:** Next is you, Yomi-san.  
**Yomi:** I'm fine without a tiara. It's easier to move without one on.  
**Suzuka:** That won't do.  
**Suzuka:** These tiara will be handed out to every toji. What would they think if one of the executive committee wasn't wearing one?  
**Yume:** Yeah\! We never get a chance like this, so you've gotta put one on\!  
**Yume:** I know it'd look good on you, Yomi-onee-san.  
**Yomi:** ...If you say so. Please go ahead, Konohana-san.  
**Suzuka:** Gladly... Fufu, just as Yume said, it's a natural fit on you, Yomi-san.  
**Yomi:** ...Thank you very much.  
**Suzuka:** Sorry to keep you waiting, Juujou-san, Musumi-san.  
**Hiyori:** Why me too\!\?  
**Kiyoka:** Thank you so much\!  
**Suzuka:** Despite you both being from the same Heijou, your reactions are quite different, aren't they?  
**Hiyori:** Of course; we're two different people\! Since you gave it to me, doesn't that mean I can do whatever I want with it now?  
**Suzuka:** If you're that opposed to it, then there's nothing I can do.  
**Kiyoka:** Ehh, you're taking it off, Juujou-san?  
**Hiyori:** A cute tiara like that doesn't look right on someone like me.  
**Hiyori:** This sort of thing is better off on a girl like you, Kiyoka.  
**Kiyoka:** That's not true\! With that gorgeous and glossy hair of yours, that tiara looks perfect on you\!  
**Hiyori:** Y-You think so?  
**Kiyoka:** I know so\! And besides, when everyone's wearing a tiara, it would be a shame if you weren't too\!  
**Hiyori:** Oh, right, everyone will be getting one of these soon. If I'd just have to put it on again... Well, I guess I can leave it like this.  
**Suzuka:** Fufu, you seem to have taken an interest in it. I made the right choice, having these tiaras ready.  
**Suzuka:** Now then, to give these presents out to all the toji, just for tonight.
