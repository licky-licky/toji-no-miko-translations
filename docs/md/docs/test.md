## 1: To See Her
**Yui:** Are you there, Hana-san\? It's Yamashiro\.  
**Yui:** Things are kind of a mess right now, so I'm just leaving you a message\.  
**Yui:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Yui:** \.\.\.Mihono-chan\.\.\. got put in confinement\. They said, we won't get to see her again\.\.\.  
**Yui:** What should I do, Hana-san\.\.\.  
**Hana:** What do you mean, Mihono got put in confinement\!\?  
**Yui:** Ah-- Hana-san\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** It's been some time, Suzumoto Hana\. You finally came to see us\.  
**Hana:** Mirja-senpai\.\.\. I still don't know\.\.\. how I'm supposed to face all of you\.\.\.  
**Hana:** But still\.\.\.\!  
**Hana:** I heard that Mihono got put in confinement\.\.\. Does it have to do with that great aradama\!\?  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.Did Yamashiro Yui tell you about that\?  
**Yui:** \.\.\.I'm sorry\. I felt like, I should let Hana-san know\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** I don't mean to criticize you for it\.  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.It makes this conversation quicker\. Asakura Mihono is in a state where there's no telling when the great aradama's power will run rampant\.  
**Mirja:** You understand the danger of the situation\.\.\. don't you\?  
**Hana:** I do\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** When Asakura Mihono lost control of the great aradama's power, it was decided that she would be put in confinement\.  
**Hana:** She lost control\!\? How's Mihono doing\!\?  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.She's fine, for now\.  
**Hana:** Thank goodness\.\.\.  
**Hana:** \.\.\.\? By the way, where's the rest of the investigation team\?  
**Mirja:** Ban Tsugumi is at her research lab\.  
**Mirja:** Shichinosato Kofuki and Musumi Kiyoka\.\.\. went to the Ministry of Defense\. Setouchi Chie joined them, to make sure they didn't do anything unreasonable\.  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.Though, as I see it, Setouchi Chie herself is the one most likely to be unreasonable\.\.\.  
**Hana:** The Ministry of Defense\?  
**Mirja:** Do you remember the facility where Takirihime was held in custody\?  
**Mirja:** Asakura Mihono has been quarantined in that same facility\.  
**Hana:** \.\.\.Alright\. I'm going to the Ministry of Defense too\.  
**Mirja:** There's no point in going\.  
**Hana:** Huh\?  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.We're forbidden from meeting with her\. The three of them know they can't see her\.\.\. but I suppose they couldn't wait here\.  
**Hana:** But, then\.\.\. Mihono\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** We can't leave here unattended, so the two of us remained behind\.\.\.  
**Yui:** \.\.\.To be honest, we don't know what to do\. I went along with Kiyoka-chan and them at first, but they wouldn't listen to anything we said\.  
**Hana:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\!  
**Hana:** Let's see Mihono\.  
**Yui:** If they'd let anybody in, we would\.\.\. but\.\.\.  
**Hana:** The investigation team can do it\. The team's attached to the Origami family now, isn't it\?  
**Yui:** Ah\!  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** I had considered that possibility myself, but\.\.\.  
**Hana:** It might be mixing up private and official matters pretty badly\.\.\. but that's not what matters most right now\.  
**Hana:** Let's go and see Mihono\!  

## 2: Visit (1\)
**Mirja:** Thank you very much for hearing out our unreasonable request, Origami Yukari-sama\.  
**Yukari:** I was concerned for Asakura as well\.  
**Yukari:** Though\.\.\. This is likely the first and last meeting we'll get\. I can't keep making this happen\.  
**Chie:** I understand\.  
**Yukari:** \.\.\.Let's go\.  
**Kanami:** Huh\? The investigation team's here\?  
**Kofuki:** What're you two doing here\?  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.It's our assignment\.  
**Yukari:** We had the two of them stationed here\. There aren't many toji who would be able to respond to Asakura when she loses control\.  
**Kiyoka:** Then, you two get to see Hono-chan\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** \.\.\.No, we don't get to visit her either\.  
**Hiyori:** The only time we'd get to see her\.\.\. is when we have to stop her from rampaging\.  
**Kiyoka:** But then\.\.\. does that mean, you're only here for if you have to cut down Hono-chan\.\.\.\?  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.\.\.\. So, why are you\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.Oh, you came to see Mihono\.  
**Kanami:** Good\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** Ever since Mihono-chan got locked up here, she probably hasn't gotten to see anybody\.\.\.  
**Hana:** Is there anything\.\.\. you want us to tell Mihono for you\?  
**Kanami:** \.\.\.Just tell her, I'm sorry\.  
**Hana:** Eh\?  
**Kanami:** Sorry, that I couldn't do anything for her\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Chie:** We all\.\.\. feel the same way\.\.\. None of us could do anything\.\.\.  
**Yui:** Chie-san\.\.\.  
**Hana:** I'll make sure\.\.\. she knows\.  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.Thanks\.  

## 3: Visit (2\)
**Chie:** Mihono-chan\!  
**Mihono:** Ah\.\.\. Chii-nee\.\.\. Guys\.\.\.  
**Kofuki:** Dang, Mihocchi\. Haven't you been doing enough crying lately\?  
**Mihono:** But\.\.\. they said\.\.\. I'd never get to see anybody again\.\.\.  
**Chie:** I know\.\.\. I know\.\.\.\!  
**Yui:** This is too horrible\! She's going to get all messed up, locked up in here by herself\!  
**Mirja:** Is there any hope of improving her conditions, Origami Yukari-sama\?  
**Yukari:** I could arrange for a better environment\.\.\. but anything more would be difficult\.  
**Yukari:** \.\.\.Asakura\. What have they told you, in regards to your treatment\?  
**Mihono:** They said, I can't ever leave here again\.\.\. that it was for the good of the world\.\.\.  
**Yui:** Huh\!\? Losing Mihono-chan is way worse for the world\!  
**Kiyoka:** If we could do something about Kanayamahime\.\.\. then, could Hono-chan leave here\?  
**Yukari:** If the great aradama within Asakura could be suppressed or fully sealed\.\.\. it could happen\.  
**Mirja:** But\.\.\. with what we have now, that would be effectively impossible\.\.\.  
**Tsugumi:** \.\.\.Then there's nothing else we can do\. I'm going to pay a visit to Hitakami-san\.  
**Chie:** Tsugumi-chan\!\?  
**Tsugumi:** Hitakami-san is currently the one with the most information on Kanayamahime\.  
**Kofuki:** Yeah\.\.\. maybe that's a good idea\.  
**Kiyoka:** Kofuki-san\! We don't need help from the kind of people who'd do those experiments\! Let's save Hono-chan ourselves\!  
**Kofuki:** The whole reason this happened is cause we can't do that\!  
**Kiyoka:** That doesn't mean\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Don't fight\!  
**Kiyoka/Kofuki:** \.\.\.  
**Mihono:** I don't want to have to see you guys fighting\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** I'm fine, with staying here like this, so\.\.\.  
**Chie:** Mihono-chan\.\.\.\? What are you saying\.\.\.\?  
**Mihono:** This whole time\.\.\. I've been thinking by myself\. Why all this had to happen\.  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.But, instead of being swallowed up by Kanayamahime, it'd be better if I just stayed locked up here\.\.\.  
**Hana:** \.\.\.I can't stand seeing you that weak, Mihono\.  
**Mihono:** Hana\?  
**Hana:** \.\.\.It's been a while\.  
**Hana:** I'm sorry\.\.\. for not being there when you were going through so much\.  
**Mihono:** It's fine\.\.\. I'm just glad you came to see me\. I really am\.\.\.  
**Yui:** Hana-san's the one who came up with this, Mihono-chan\. How, if we asked Yukari-sama, we could get special permission to see you\.  
**Hana:** We just used how the investigation team is working for the Origami family\. We did have to bend the rules for it\.  
**Hana:** But, it was the right thing to do\.  
**Hana:** \.\.\.Don't try to sacrifice yourself, Mihono\. Nobody wants you to do that\.  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.  
**Hana:** You always looked best when you're saving somebody else\.\.\. Whenever you're holding up your okatana as a toji\.  
**Hana:** Way better than wallowing in self-sacrifice in this place\.  
**Hana:** So\.\.\. don't give up here\. If the investigation team didn't have you\.\.\. I couldn't take it\.  
**Mihono:** Hana\.\.\.  
**Hana:** All of us are wanting you to come back\. Nobody thinks it'd be better if you stayed here, okay\?  
**Hanae:** That goes for Kanami-san and Hiyori-san too\.  
**Mihono:** Kanami and Juujou-san\?  
**Yui:** They're both right outside\.  
**Yui:** And, they're really depressed they couldn't do anything for you\.  
**Yui:** I'm sure everybody else feels the same way\!  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Chie:** So please, don't give up now\.\.\. We want to have more time with you\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** I mean\.\.\. I want that too\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Is it okay\.\.\. if I still keep hoping for that\.\.\.\? Can I still\.\.\. keep wanting to be with you\.\.\.\?  
**Chie:** You shouldn't have to ask\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Chii-nee\.\.\. I want to get out of here\.\.\. Help me\.\.\.  
**Chie:** I know\.\.\. I will\.\.\.\!  

## 4: I Want to Be With My Friends (1\)
**Mihono:** \.\.\.\.\.\.Sigh, they're all gone again\.  
**Mihono:** But\.\.\. Yeah\. I'm feeling better\. I mean, I never got to talk to anybody ever since they put me in here\.  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** UWAAAAHH------\!  
**Mihono:** I was hugging Chii-nee and crying right in front of everybody\!\? Now I'm all embarrassed thinking back on it--\!  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.Aha, what am I even doing anymore\.  
**Mihono:** I guess I felt like there was nothing I could do\.\.\. but\.\.\. I'm fine now\.  
**Mihono:** They all haven't given up yet\. So, I'm\.\.\. definitely not giving up either\!  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Kanayamahime\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Do you want to tell me something\?  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.I'm not going to give up\.  
**Mihono:** I thought, so long as I stayed in here\.\.\. that might be what's best\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** But, everybody said they want me with them\.  
**Mihono:** So, I'm going to get out of here no matter what\.\.\. I'm going to get back to them\.  
**Mihono:** Back to the investigation team\.\.\. Back to Chii-nee, and Kiyoka, Fukki, Mirja-san, Yui, Tsugumi-san, Hana\.\.\. Kanami and everybody\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Cause I still want to be a toji\!  
**Mihono:** So I'll do it\!  

## 5: I Want to Be With My Friends (2\)
**Mihono:** \.\.\.Eh\?  
**Mihono:** Oh no-- they got attacked\.\.\.\! \.\.\.Wait\?  
**Mihono:** Why do I\.\.\. have Kashuu Kiyomitsu\.\.\.\?  
**Mihono:** Did\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** I\.\.\. attack them\?  
**Mihono:** N-No\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** Mihono-chan\!\! \.\.\.\!\? That's\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Kanami\.\.\. It's not like that, it's not\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** Did you\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** No, I wasn't; I didn't mean to\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** We get it\! We get it, okay, so\.\.\. Calm down, Mihono-chan\!  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.I didn't want, this\.\.\. I still wanted, to be with everybody\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** MIHONO\!\!  
**Mihono:** NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\!\!  

## 6: Destroy Kanayamahime
In the dead of night--

  
**Akira:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Yuuki:** \.\.\.Why do you think she called us for this late\?  
**Akira:** \.\.\.You'll know when Makocchan gets here\. Anyway, how're you feeling now\?  
**Akira:** Your cold doing better\?  
**Yuuki:** Yep, I feel fine now\. If anything, I feel like I'd get weaker if I rested any more\.  
**Akira:** Alright\.  
**Akira:** \.\.\.If it ever feels like too much for you, let me know\. It's gonna be a rough night\.  
**Yuuki:** \.\.\.Akira-nee-sama\? Do you know what's going on\?  
**Makoto:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Makoto:** Inago, Toribane\.  
**Akira/Yuuki:** Yes\.  
**Makoto:** It seems that Kanayamahime has awakened\.  
**Akira:** \.\.\.\.\.\.Yeah\.  
**Yuuki:** Why are you so calm about that\!\?  
**Yuuki:** What are you talking about, Nee-sama\!\? What about Mihono-san\.\.\.  
**Makoto:** Kanayamahime cut down the toji guarding her and is currently missing\.  
**Akira:** \.\.\.\!  
**Makoto:** Strike down and exorcise Kanayamahime at once\. This is what tamayori toji are for\.  
**Yuuki:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Makoto:** You'll take care of it, won't you\?  
**Akira:** I will\.  
**Yuuki:** \.\.\.\.\.\.I will\.  
**Yuuki:** I really wish it didn't come to this\.\.\. but, if you order it, Makoto-nee-sama, then that's all there is to it\.  
**Yuuki:** I'll strike down Kanayamahime\.  
**Akira:** Makocchan\.  
**Makoto:** Yes\?  
**Akira:** About Yuuki\.\.\.  
**Makoto:** What about Toribane\?  
**Akira:** \.\.\.\.\.\.Nah, it's nothing\. Let's go\.  
**Yuuki:** Right\!  
**Makoto:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Makoto:** \.\.\.Is there anyone there\?  
**Hitakami Toji:** What do you need\?  
**Makoto:** Please make this announcement to all toji\.  
**Makoto:** We, the Hitakami faction, will destroy Kanayamahime\! Allow Inago and Toribane to reach Kanayamahime by all means\!  

## 7: Suppression Order (1\)
At that time--

  
**Maki:** Everyone's here, Yukari-sama\.  
**Yukari:** \.\.\.Kanayamahime has awakened\. Her current whereabouts are unknown\.  
**Everyone:** \!\?  
**Chie:** That can't be\.\.\. Why\.\.\.\?  
**Kiyoka:** No\.\.\. She said she wouldn't give up\.\.  
**Yui:** Mihono-chan\.\.\.  
**Kofuki:** \.\.\.\!\!  
**Kofuki:** Hey\! What the hell did you do to Mihocchi\!\? This came out of nowhere\.\.\. This is bullshit\!  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.Get a hold of yourself, Shichinosato Kofuki\. Origami Yukari-sama, could we have an explanation\?  
**Yukari:** If you want to know the specifics, you should hear it from them\. \.\.\.Etou, Juujou\.  
**Kanami:** \.\.\.Okay\.  
**Kanami:** Hiyori-chan and I were waiting on alert at the Ministry of Defense, in case Mihono-chan lost control\.\.\.  
**Kofuki:** Who gives a shit about that\!\?  
**Kofuki:** Tell us what happened\!  
**Kanami:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.\.\.\.Mihono attacked someone\.  
**Kofuki:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.Huh\? You think this is a joke or what\?  
**Kofuki:** Oi, give me a real answer, Kanami\!  
**Kanami:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Kofuki:** Say something\!  
**Hiyori:** It's the truth\!   
**Hiyori:** When Kanami and I heard Mihono went berserk, we went to see her\.  
**Hiyori:** And when we got there\.\.\. we saw toji on the floor and Mihono standing over them\.  
**Tsugumi:** \.\.\.Did Asakura-san really do it\? Or did it just look that way\?  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.Who could have made it look like that\?  
**Tsugumi:** \.\.\.\.\.\.That's fair\.  
**Hana:** \.\.\.  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.What condition are the toji she attacked in\?  
**Maki:** It seems like it only went as far as them losing utsushi\. Thankfully, it wasn't life threatening\.  
**Mai:** At that point\.\.\. was it already Kanayamahime\?  
**Hiyori:** No\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** It was Mihono\.  
**Kanami:** There's no way Mihono-chan could have wanted to hurt anyone though\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** She was really panicked and afraid\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** Seeing her like that\.\.\.  
**Mai:** \.\.\.  
**Mai:** So Mihono-chan attacked them with her okatana\?  
**Kofuki:** Hey\! She just said Mihocchi didn't want to hurt anybody\!\!  
**Sayaka:** Stop, Kofuki\.  
**Kofuki:** Why should I\!\? They're the ones treating Mihocchi like she tried to kill somebody\!  
**Mai:** It doesn't make sense\.\.\.  
**Sayaka:** Mai\? What do you mean\.\.\.\?  
**Mai:** Why would Mihono-chan have her okatana\?  
**Chie:** \.\.\.Eh\?  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.True, you're absolutely right\.  
**Mirja:** After being placed in confinement, Asakura Mihono should not have had Kashuu Kiyomitsu with her\. Isn't that right\?  
**Mai:** Yes\.  
**Suzuka:** Kashuu Kiyomitsu was confiscated while Asakura-san was confined\. It's currently in secure custody\.\.\. or should have been\. It seems that someone brought it out\.  
**Ellen:** \.\.\.On top of that, there's one other thing that caught my attention\.  
**Ellen:** Kanamin and Hiyoyon, you two were stationed at the Ministry of Defense in case Mihomiho went berserk, right\?  
**Ellen:** So then, why did some other toji go up against Mihomiho before you two\?  
**Kaoru:**　\.\.\.This whole thing's fishy\.  
**Kaoru:** I don't who, but somebody's going around pulling the strings here\.  
**Mihono:** Mai\.\.\. did somebody frame Mihono\?  
**Mai:** \.\.\.I think that's probably it\.  
**Mai:** In order to make Kanayamahime awaken\.\.\.  
**Yukari:** The Hitakami faction is already taking action\. If you want to save Asakura\.\.\. you'll have to reach her before the Hitakami faction does\.  

## 8: Suppression Order (2\)
**Maki:** Once you've decided on your plan, let us know\. We'll follow along with it\.  
**Mirja:** The Special Defense Team will be assisting us\?  
**Maki:** It's on Akane-sama's order\.  
**Hiyori:** With all these top toji, we can settle this quick\. I'll use my Hitotsu no Tachi\.  
**Kanami:** You can't do that, Hiyori-chan\!  
**Kanami:** Even if it brings Mihono-chan back, there's no point if you're gone\!  
**Hiyori:** Still, we don't have any other options\.  
**Mirja:** No, Etou Kanami is correct here\.  
**Mirja:** If you were to use Hitotsu no Tachi to suppress Kanayamahime, there's the potential for it to repeat the effects of the Kamakura Special Hazardous Waste Leakage Issue\.  
**Mirja:** In the current state of things, with the rampant frequency of aradama appearances, using Hitotsu no Tachi poses too much of a risk\.  
**Friedman:** Thinking about that won't do us much good now though\.  
**Ellen:** Grandpa\!  
**Kaoru:** What's the old man doing here\?  
**Friedman:** I thought I might be some help\.  
**Friedman:** Whether or not this could repeat the effects of the Special Hazardous Waste Leakage Issue, there's too little information on just what kind of aradama Kanayamahime is\.  
**Friedman:** We could just as easily assume it would do the same thing as with Tagitsuhime, or that it wouldn't\.  
**Kaoru:** So we're in the dark\.  
**Friedman:** \.\.\.You all have the choice of three paths to commit to\. The first: consider Mihono-kun as Kanayamahime and suppress her\.  
**Kiyoka:** We're not going to do that\!  
**Friedman:** I know\. The second: Hiyori-kun will use Hitotsu no Tachi, saving Mihono-kun\.  
**Kanami:** We're not doing that either\.  
**Friedman:** Then, the third option: Mihono-kun is saved, without sacrificing Hiyori-kun\.  
**Chie:** There's a way to make that happen\.\.\.\?  
**Friedman:** \.\.\.I'm sorry to say, we haven't found a means to doing that\.  
**Friedman:** Still, there isn't very much time to mull it over\. The tamayori toji are already making their move\.  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.We'll move out as well\.  
**Mirja:** If we can't find Asakura Mihono before the Hitakami Faction does, she won't survive\.  

## 9: An Unfortunate Run-In
**Chie:** Mihono-chan\.\.\. Where'd you\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** Even though we tried looking places Hono-chan might've gone, she isn't anywhere\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** Right now, the one moving Asakura Mihono's body is Kanayamahime\.  
**Mirja:** If she were there, it would be a stroke of luck\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** So we're out of leads\.\.\.  
**Tsugumi:** Fighting has broken out between Asakura-san and other toji\.  
**Chie:** --\!  
**Mai:** Was anyone hurt\.\.\.\?  
**Tsugumi:** There's no need to worry\. While some toji were injured, none of the injuries are severe\.  
**Chie:** Thank goodness\.\.\.  
**Tsugumi:** Currently, they're in pursuit while maintaining a distance\. I'll send you the relevant data\.  
**Kanami:** Let's go, everybody\!  
**Hiyori:** --\! Hold on\!  
**Kaoru:** What's wrong, Hiyori\?  
**Kanami:** \.\.\.Someone's coming\!  
**Akira:** Whoa there\!  
**Ellen:** Akira\!  
**Akira:** The hell; the whole gang's here\.  
**Akira:** Normally, this could be a good brawl, but\.\.\. Sorry\. We don't got time to deal with you now\.  
**Akira:** \.\.\.Out of the way\.  
**Kofuki:** Fuck you\! How about you get lost\!  
**Yuuki:** \.\.\.There's some rowdy people in our way\.  
**Yuuki:** Though\.\.\. it's lucky we ran into you here\! I'll make up for what happened last time\!  

## 10: Yume and Yuuki (1\)
**Yuuki:** TSUBAKURO YUMEEEEEEEEEE\!  
**Yume:** Whoopsie\.  
**Yume:** Umm\.\.\. Who were you again\?  
**Yuuki:** Don't make light of me\!  
**Maki:** That's Toribane Yuuki, Yume\.  
**Yume:** Ahh, from that one time\! I couldn't tell cause you're wearing that stuff\.  
**Yume:** But, you're still just as weak, huh\.  
**Yuuki:** Screw you\!  
**Yume:** This's that tamayori thing\? Even with that on, is that all you can do\?  
**Akira:** You sure talk a big game\! Then, how about you take me on too\!  
**Yume:** Ahaha\! You're ganging up on me\?  
**Yuuki:** Nee-sama\! I'll defeat Tsubakuro Yume myself\!  
**Akira:** I'm not letting you have all the fun\! Let me join in on this\!\!  
**Yuuki:** \.\.\.It's first come, first serve\!  
**Yume:** That's more like it\! It's finally getting fun\!  
**Suzuka:** What a hotheaded bunch\. Though, this works in our favor\.  
**Maki:** Right\. \.\.\.The rest of you go on ahead\. We'll take care of things here\.  
**Mirja:** With this many of them\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** Will that really be fine\?  
**Maki:** It'll take more than that to make a difference to us\.\.\. Get going\!  
**Suzuka:** More than this\? Were you trying to show off\?  
**Maki:** Still, we can handle this, can't we\?  
**Suzuka:** I suppose\. \.\.\.Oh\?  
**Yomi:** \.\.\.Reinforcements\.  
**Maki:** (I wanted to go back up Yume, but\.\.\. That's not happening with this many of them\.\)  
**Maki:** (No, even against two tamayori toji, Yume'll definitely win\.\)  
**Maki:** (So there's only one thing we have to do\!\)  
**Maki:** That's still not going to be enough against us\.  
**Maki:** If you're looking to bring down the Special Defense Team, you should have brought twice that\!  
**Maki:** HAAAAAAAAAAAH\!\!  
**Akira:** ORAAAAAAA\!  
**Yume:** Whoa\!  
**Yuuki:** Stop only fighting Akira-nee-sama\! I want to smack you down too\!  
**Yume:** --\!\!  
**Yume:** (Fighting both of them is actually pretty tough, but\.\.\.\)  
**Yume:** Ahaha\!  
**Yume:** This is finally getting exciting\. Hey\.\.\. you can go harder than that, can't you\?  
**Akira:** --\!\?  
**Yume:** Well\?  
**Akira:** Course we can\!\! Yuuki\!\!  
**Yuuki:** Yes\!  
**Yuuki:** I'll make sure\.\.\. you'll never forget the name Yuuki\!
