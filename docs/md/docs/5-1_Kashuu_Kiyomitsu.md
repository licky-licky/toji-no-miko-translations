## 1: We Won't Go Up a Year\!\?
**Yukari:** Go now with Asakura, into the boundary between this world and the netherworld, and destroy Tagitsuhime's true body, Hirukomitama.  
**Yume:** Destroy Hirukomitama?  
**Yume:** I don't really get it, but is that some kind of super strong enemy that only I can handle?  
**Yukari:** Of course.  
**Yume:** I thought so\! After all, it's Tagitsuhime's true body, right\! It sounds interesting\! I'll do it\!  
**Yume:** It feels like it's finally time for us to break out the secret weapon\!  
**Yukari:** Whatever may happen, do not let your guard down. In both size and strength, Hirukomitama will be no ordinary foe.  
**Yukari:** What's more, this operation comes with a time limit. If you are unable to defeat Hirukomitama before it makes landfall, all will be lost.  
**Yukari:** And, after you have destroyed Hirukomitama, you are to return here at once. Do you understand?  
**Yume:** So, the important bits are, I just have to beat it real quick and come right back, right?  
**Yukari:** Yes. That's all I can ask for. You understand as well, don't you, Asakura?  
**Mihono:** Huh...? But, then, what about Tagitsuhime...  
**Yukari:** I'm telling you, there is no time. We have no choice but to trust Etou and Juujou with Tagitsuhime.  
**Yukari:** Etou and Juujou as they are now will surely destroy Tagitsuhime\! You will fulfill your own role\!  
**Mihono:** I just have to trust Kanami and Juujou-san then... I got it...\!  
**Yume:** Kashuu Kiyomitsu onee-san, don't slow me down out there, okay\!  
**Mihono:** Don't worry about that... Right now, I'm pretty strong too\!  
**Inago Akira:** ......  
**Akira:** Mihono, you seriously went up into the border between here and the netherworld... Just like Makocchan said you would.  
May 2019.

  
**Mihono:** M-Makeup lessons are over\~\... Good work today, Kanami\~\.  
**Mihono:** Also, thanks for helping us study, Mai.  
**Mai:** This is about all I can do, so don't think anything of it, Mihono-chan.  
**Mai:** We'll all go up a year together, for sure.  
**Mihono:** Ha... Haha, hahahaha... There's still a whole year left too, and yet... That it'll be this bad, being at the level of not being able to move up a year...  
**Mihono:** I mean, it's not like I think I'm really smart or anything, but, if even Fukki can move up a year...  
**Mai:** I think that might be a little rude to Shichinosato-san...  
**Mai:** Don't worry, it's fine. You still have a year to go, so how about we work our way back up from here?  
**Mihono:** That's not gonna be easy, Mai... For Kanami either... Just look at her.  
**Kanami:** ......  
**Mihono:** She studied so hard she died on the inside.  
**Mai:** Kanami-chan\!\?  
**Kanami:** ...I-I'm fine, Mai-chan... It's just, after nothing but makeup lessons every day, and covering so much subject material...  
**Mihono:** Kanami was totally absent for the third semester of her second year, after all.  
**Kanami:** Yeah, if I didn't have Mai-chan, I wonder how things would turn out for me now...  
**Mihono:** Let's repeat our third year of middle school together, Kanami\!  
**Kanami:** Let's do it, Mihono-chan\!  
**Mai:** Aren't we working so hard so you won't have to do that?  
**Kanami/Mihono:** Oh, right.  
**Mihono:** Okay, that's enough of the negative stuff\! Let's go get some bubble tea, Kanami, Mai\!  
**Kanami:** Mmm\~\! Bubble tea's so good\!  
**Mihono:** You're totally hooked on bubble tea, aren't you.  
**Kanami:** Of course I am, when something this yummy got popular out of nowhere\!  
**Mai:** Now that you mention it... In the time while you and Hiyori-chan were gone, a lot of things changed, didn't they.  
**Kanami:** Yeah\! I couldn't believe it when I heard Yukari-sama had retired and Akane-sama took over as the bureau director of the Sword Administration Bureau\!  
**Mai:** And then, changes closer to us would be, the investigation team, wouldn't it?  
**Mihono:** [slurrrp]... Eh? Ah, you mean, us getting attached to the Origami family?  
**Kanami:** I'm surprised you even got your own investigation room at Renpu Girls' School\!  
**Mihono:** I was really happy about that. We never had anything like it before, so it's like, the investigation team's home base\! It's exciting.  
**Kanami:** And also, you've gotten a heck of a lot stronger, Mihono-chan.  
**Mihono:** Y-You think so\~\?  
**Kanami:** Yeah\! It's so much fun facing off against you\! When we get back, wanna spar?  
**Mihono:** Sure thing\! We've gotta exercise off the bubble tea and all\!  
**Mihono:** ...Ah.  
**Kanami:** Is that a mission? Aradama are appearing as often as ever, aren't they.  
**Mihono:** ...Yeah.  
**Mihono:** Sorry, Kanami, Mai. I've gotta go.  
**Mai:** Good luck out there, Mihono-chan.  
**Kanami:** Take care\!  

## 2: Mihono's Dream
**Mihono:** HAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Mihono:** ...Phew.  
**Mirja:** That aradama now appears to have been the last of them. You've done well, Asakura Mihono.  
**Kofuki:** Seriously\!\? That was nowhere near enough-\!  
**Kofuki:** And Mihocchi got practically all of them\! Why can't you be more considerate to me, Mihocchi-\!  
**Mihono:** Eh? Did I really beat that many?  
**Kofuki:** You did\! Damnit, you took all my share.  
**Mihono:** Sorry, Fukki\! I was feeling stressed out after my makeup lessons, so... I couldn't help it.  
**Kofuki:** Like hell you couldn't\! C'mon, c'mon\! Be more sorry\!  
**Mihono:** I said I was sorry\~\!  
**Kiyoka:** Your makeup lessons must be difficult, right?  
**Mihono:** Yeah... But, if I don't do them, they say I can't move up a year...  
**Yui:** Things are going so well on the investigation team side of things too, Mihono-chan. The heavens are too cruel to grant two blessings\! You might be the ace of the investigation team, but your grades are in the red... Could this be gap moe\!\?  
**Chie:** I'm sorry, Mihono-chan. Under normal circumstances, I'd have liked to watch over and help you study, but...  
**Mihono:** You don't have to treat it so seriously\! So long as I do my makeup lessons right, I should be fine\!  
**Mihono:** And besides, you're busy with college, aren't you, Chii-nee?  
**Chie:** Yes, it's a little busy right now... But, I should be able to get a bit more free time soon, so I'll help you with your studying then.  
**Mihono:** Okay\!  
**Mihono:** Ah, oh yeah, Mirja-san. You and Kiyoka are looking into Kashuu Kiyomitsu for us, aren't you?  
**Mihono:** How is that going, anyway?  
**Mirja:** As of now, not well. It's enjoyable reading through the records, but we have nothing to show for it.  
**Kiyoka:** That's why, we were talking about not just looking up Kashuu Kiyomitsu, but researching into the Asakura family too.  
**Mihono:** My family?  
**Mirja:** We seem to be at our limit with this. So we've decided to try for a slightly different approach.  
**Mirja:** However, we've only just begun down that line of research, so we have nothing noteworthy to report yet.  
**Mihono:** ...Oh, okay then.  
**Chie:** ...Mihono-chan? Is there something on your mind?  
**Mihono:** Eh\!\? Nothing really... Why're you asking all of a sudden, Chii-nee?  
**Chie:** I just had a feeling, like you're acting a little different than usual...  
**Mihono:** No way; I'm the same as I always am\!  
**Mihono:** (It's this same dream today...)  
**Mihono:** (Of somebody heading into a sea of fire...)  
**Mihono:** I had that dream again...  
**Mihono:** Something on my mind... I can't really tell Chii-nee, can I. That I'm just having this weird dream over and over.  
**Mihono:** But, what's this dream about, anyway... Are you showing it to me, Kiyomitsu?  
**Mihono:** ......It's not like an okatana can answer me I guess.  
**Mihono:** Yawn...  
**Kiyoka:** Not getting enough sleep?  
**Mihono:** Yeah, kind of...  
**Tsugumi:** Are things going alright, Asakura-san?  
**Mihono:** Ah, yeah\! I'm just a little sleep deprived, so you don't have to worry about me\!  
**Tsugumi:** If you'd like, I could give you a drink that induces good sleep. I made it myself, and I'm fairly proud of how the calories and nutritional balance came out.  
**Mihono:** I-I don't think I'll be needing that...  
**Tsugumi:** Is that so.  
**Tsugumi:** Then, I'll report to you the investigation team's next assignment. A new Akabane sword has been located, and the investigation team is to go recover it.  
**Kiyoka:** It's been a while since we did any investigating into the Akabane swords, hasn't it?  
**Yui:** That's for sure-. It's been nothing but suppressing aradama lately, so we haven't gotten anywhere with researching those.  
**Mirja:** A new Akabane sword... We should leave at once.  
**Kofuki:** Hold up, can I say something?  
**Mirja:** What is it?  
**Kofuki:** Do you need me for this?  
**Kofuki:** Cause, if you don't, I'd rather go with the Special Raid Unit, y'know? I'd get to play with aradama-chan over with them.  
**Tsugumi:** I see, then, please go join them, Shichinosato-san.  
**Kofuki:** For real\!\? Never hurts to ask, huh\!  
**Tsugumi:** The report stated that large numbers of aradama had appeared in the area of the Akabane sword... But, I'm sure the other members will be able to deal with it.  
**Kofuki:** Say that first\!  
**Kofuki:** Oi, what're you guys waiting for\! Let's go already\!  
**Mirja:** I see you're still as skilled at handling her.  
**Chie:** Fufu, that's for sure.  
**Chie:** Anyway... Investigation team, set out to recover the Akabane sword\!  

## 3: Special Defense Team, All Present
**Yukari:** Enter.  
**Yomi:** Please excuse me.  
**Yume:** You're late, Yomi-onee-san\! I was getting tired of waiting.  
**Suzuka:** It's been quite some time, Yomi-san.  
**Yomi:** ......  
**Maki:** Welcome back, Yomi. Yukari-sama, the Special Defense Team is all present.  
**Yukari:** I'm glad you're here.  
**Yukari:** Ordinarily, Akane would be the one to deliver orders to the Special Defense Team. However...  
**Suzuka:** We understand.  
**Suzuka:** Acting as both the bureau director and head of the Origami family, Akane-sama's burden grows by the day.  
**Suzuka:** To the point where, even making time to hand down our orders would require adjusting her schedule.  
**Yukari:** I need you to be Akane's strength.  
**Maki:** We will.  
**Yomi:** ......  
**Yume:** Yukari-sama, what kinda mission do you have for us this time? If it's suppressing aradama, I want to do it\!  
**Yukari:** Unfortunately, this is unrelated to aradama. Your assignment now is the investigation, as well as observation, of an extremist faction within Mokusa.  
**Yume:** An extremist faction in Mokusa?  
**Yukari:** In addition to the main faction of Mokusa, with Akane acting at the top, there are many smaller sub-factions.  
**Yukari:** Among them, there is a faction advocating particularly radical ideals.  
**Yume:** That means there's a bunch of dangerous people there, right? So, all we've gotta do is beat them.  
**Suzuka:** This won't be solved so simply.  
**Maki:** Even if they may be extremists, it doesn't make them a criminal group. They're no more than just another group within Mokusa.  
**Yume:** So we can't do anything to them until they do something dangerous first... That sounds kind of annoying.  
**Suzuka:** ...Well, it certainly isn't an assignment suited for you, Yume.  
**Maki:** Everybody has things they're suited for and things they're not. I know you just joined us, but I want you to work on this, Yomi.  
**Yomi:** ...Will this really be alright?  
**Maki:** Will what?  
**Yomi:** With me being here, the Special Defense Team is now composed of all the former members of the elite guard.  
**Yomi:** There will be people who won't approve of this.  
**Yomi:** If you continue with only the three of you, there won't much protesting, will there?  
**Maki:** Whether there's three of us or four of us, people won't be happy either way. You don't have to worry about our reputation.  
**Suzuka:** We cannot change the things we've done in the past... All we can do is strive to make up for it with our actions now.  
**Yomi:** ...But, I don't believe that I am wrong.  
**Yomi:** Yet, still...  
**Yume:** None of that really matters, Yomi-onee-san. What's important is that we're all back together.  
**Yomi:** Tsubakuro-san...  
**Yukari:** I called upon you because you are needed. Will you do it?  
**Yomi:** Yukari-sama...  
**Yomi:** I understand. I will accept this assignment. Which faction is it I should be monitoring?  
**Yukari:** We haven't gathered enough information to pin down a name at this point. But, several factions are showing suspicious behavior, such as in their movements of funds.  
**Yukari:** I'll deliver the documentation to you afterward.  
**Yomi:** Yes ma'am.  
**Yukari:** You three as well, I'm depending on you.  
**All the Special Defense Team:** Yes ma'am\!  

## 4: Mihono Changing (1)
**Mirja:** The Akabane sword appears to have been discovered around here.  
**Kofuki:** There's not a single aradama-chan in this place\!\! That jackass lied to me\!\!  
**Chie:** ...That's strange. I even checked it for myself, and it's true that there were reports of large numbers of aradama appearing here.  
**Mirja:** I can confirm those reports as well. It seems it would be best to proceed with caution now.  
**Kofuki:** Why even bother.  
**Kofuki:** If there's gonna be some aradama-chan, then that's great, but if there's not, then let's just hurry it up and go back.  
**Kofuki:** C'mon, let's get that Akabane sword already. Where's it supposed to be?  
**Mirja:** According to the report... It was there.  
**Mihono:** Over here? I'll go check it out\!  
**Mihono:** Chii-nee\! Mirja-saaan\! I got the Akabane sword-\!  
**Mirja:** I'll make the report to Ban Tsugumi that we have collected the Akabane sword.  
**Mirja:** In response, she sent a photo of the Akabane sword... Setouchi Chie, will you please confirm this with me?  
**Chie:** ...Mm, this seems to be the one.  
**Kiyoka:** I'm glad we could finish this easily... This means our mission is over, doesn't it.  
**Yui:** We came all the way out here on a trip, so let's at least go pay a visit to some hot springs\!  
**Mihono:** There goes Yui trying to get us in the hot springs again-.  
**Yui:** That's just who I am\! So, what do you think? Hot springs aren't so bad every now and then, right?  
**Mihono:** Thinking about it... It might be nice. I haven't been sleeping well lately...  
**Yui:** For that, I reccomend hot springs\! Once you get in the water, it'll improve your circulation, and you'll have no problem sleeping like a baby\!  
**Mihono:** Ugh, that sounds really nice right about now...  
**Kiyoka:** ...That reminds me, Hono-chan. You were looking sleepy in the investigation room too, weren't you?  
**Aradama:** ......  
**Kofuki:** -\! Kiyoka, behind you\!  
**Kiyoka:** Eh?  
**Mihono:** She's in trouble\!\!  
**Kiyoka:** Th-Thank you, Hono-chan.  
**Kiyoka:** But...  
**Aradama:** ......  
**Mihono:** There's so many... Are we surrounded?  
**Mirja:** I've never seen such organized behavior before. I would think there is some kind of leader behind this group...  
**Aradama:** OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\!\!  
**Kiyoka:** What an awful sound...  
**Yui:** There's the king of the hill, or, king of the aradama... I guess?  
**Chie:** More intelligent, and more capable... This will be trouble.  
**Mihono:** Yeah. That aradama... It's strong.  
**Kofuki:** Like it matters\!  
**Kofuki:** I finally get to see me some aradama-chan\! Let's get right to the fun\!  

## 5: Mihono Changing (2)
**Kiyoka:** KYAA\!  
**Yui:** Are you okay, Kiyoka-chan\!\?  
**Kiyoka:** I am... But, I can't use utsushi anymore...  
**Kofuki:** ...Guess that's that. Stay behind me, Kiyoka.  
**Kiyoka:** O-Okay.  
**Kiyoka:** ...Thanks a lot, Kofuki-san.  
**Kofuki:** It's nothing.  
**Chie:** ...What do you think we should do, Mirja?  
**Mirja:** We should wait for reinforcements.  
**Mirja:** I finished reporting to Ban Tsugumi that we engaged aradama. When no follow-up report arrives, she should assume our circumstances here.  
**Chie:** ...I suppose that's our best option.  
**Mihono:** Wait.  
**Chie:** Mihono-chan?  
**Mihono:** An aradama like that, me and Kiyomitsu... We can beat it.  
**Chie:** Now isn't the time to say things like that\! Mirja is considering the whole team here...  
**Mihono:** It'll be fine, Chii-nee. This is just what I need to shake off my sleepiness.  
**Mihono:** HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Mihono:** Give me your power, Kashuu Kiyomitsu\!  

## 6: Disregarding Orders
**Mihono:** And this is... The end of them\!  
**Aradama:** GYAAAAAAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Mihono:** Phew... See, I told you it'd be fine, Chii-nee\!  
**Chie:** Mihono-chan...  
**Mirja:** If you find it too hard to say, then I'll be the one to say it. Asakura Mihono, your behavior just now was hardly commendable.  
**Mihono:** ...Huh?  
**Mirja:** You may not have intended it, but that was a clear disregard for orders.  
**Mihono:** ...But, I just thought, instead of waiting for backup, it'd be faster if I beat them...  
**Kofuki:** Is this really something worth nagging her over? I do that kind of thing all the time.  
**Yui:** Y-Yeah, she's right\! More importantly, everyone's tired, aren't they? Let's go see those hot springs, remember\!  
**Mirja:** ...Let me just say this.  
**Mirja:** Asakura Mihono, you should be using your strength to protect your allies before you defeat your enemies.  
**Mihono:** Fukki was protecting Kiyoka, wasn't she? So, I didn't have to...  
**Mirja:** And what if Shichinosato Kofuki was attacked by more aradama than she could hold off alone?  
**Mirja:** That was a possibility as well.  
**Mihono:** Then...  
**Chie:** Let's leave it at that, Mirja.  
**Mirja:** But...  
**Chie:** Mirja, could you please get in touch with Tsugumi-chan?  
**Mirja:** ...Understood.  
**Chie:** ...You all did great. We had a rough time today, so how about we wash away our tiredness in a hot spring\!  
**Kiyoka:** Um... Thank you for before, Kofuki-san.  
**Kofuki:** It's not really something you've gotta thank me for. I just did what was natural.  
**Kiyoka:** Of course\!  
**Mihono:** What're you two talking about, Kiyoka-?  
**Kiyoka:** Nothing at all, Hono-chan\! Anyway, aren't you looking forward to the hot springs\!  
**Mihono:** Yeah\! Hot springs\~, hot springs\~\.  
**Mirja:** ......  
**Mirja:** Was this for the best, Setouchi Chie? Asakura Mihono is...  
**Chie:** After suddenly getting a lot stronger, she can't get her mental balance right, can she.  
**Mirja:** ...So you do understand. Then, why did you stop me?  
**Chie:** Well... I don't think you were wrong, Mirja.  
**Chie:** But... With how Mihono-chan is now, I don't think she would understand.  
**Mirja:** You think she needs to suffer the consequences before she can realize it for herself? ...That's unusually harsh for you, Setouchi Chie.  
**Chie:** Of course, I don't plan on neglecting her until she suffers for it.  
**Chie:** If we're all careful so that she doesn't get herself hurt... I'm sure Mihono-chan will come to understand it herself.  
**Mirja:** I take back what I just said. You really are too sweet on Asakura Mihono after all.  
**Chie:** I am her onee-san, aren't I?  
**Mihono:** Yawn...  
**Kiyoka:** Ah, you yawned again.  
**Yui:** Mihono-chan looks just as cute when she's yawning.  
**Kofuki:** Quit making passes at her. Anyway, what're you doing that's keeping you up at night?  
**Mihono:** Nngh, I'm not really doing anything.  
**Kiyoka:** You say that, but I bet you're training, aren't you?  
**Mihono:** I'm not, I'm not.  
**Yui:** Are you chatting online?  
**Mihono:** I'm not. It's just... I've sort of been having bad dreams lately.  
**Kofuki:** Hmm? What kind of dreams?  
**Mihono:** Uhh... I can't really remember much about it.  
**Kofuki:** Well, dreams are like that. You'll stop having them sooner or later.  
**Mihono:** ...Yeah, you're right.  
**Mihono:** (You'll stop having them sooner or later... Yeah, that's all there is to dreams\!\)  
**Mihono:** Okaaay\! I'm gonna get in the hot springs and sleep nice and sound tonight\!  

## 7: Cracking Glass
**Mihono:** (Ahh... It's this again.)  
**Mihono:** (Who is that anyway... Why are they going to the fire...?\)  
**Asakura Mihono?:** ......  
**Mihono:** (Eh, it's me\!\?\)  
**Mihono:** Gh, agh\! It burns...\!  
**Mihono:** U-Ugh... Aghh\!  
**Mihono:** (The fire... It's coming into my body... I can feel it burning everywhere from the inside too...\!\)  
**Mihono:** (It burns... It's burning...\! Like I'm really burning alive...\!\)  
**Mihono:** UWAAAAAAAAGGGHHHHHH\!  
**Mihono:** -\!\!  
**Mihono:** [pant, pant]... What was that dream just now...  
**Mihono:** I was being burned by the flames...? I don't get it...  
**Mihono:** ...Ughh, I'm soaked with sweat...  
**Mihono:** This is so gross... I should get changed and get some water...  
**Mihono:** [gulp, gulp]... Phew. I think I can go back to bed now.  
**Mihono:** It'd be nice if I didn't see that dream this time though...  
**Mihono:** ...Huh? The glass cracked?  
**Mihono:** Ah...\!  
**Mihono:** This is... just like when I'm using Kiyomitsu's power...\!\? But, why...? I don't even have my okatana with me...\!  
**Mihono:** Calm down... Get it under control\!\!  
**Mihono:** [Pant pant pant]...\!  
**Mihono:** What's happening to me...? Why did Kiyomitsu's power come bursting out on its own\!\?  

## 8: The Reason I Can't Sleep (1)
**Mihono:** ...  
**Mirja:** Look out, Asakura Mihono\!  
**Mihono:** Eh?  
**Aradama:** GYAAA\!\!  
**Mihono:** -\!\! Th-Thanks a lot for that, Mirja-san\!  
**Mirja:** Don't lose your wits in the middle of battle\!\!  
**Mihono:** I'm sorry\!  
**Kofuki:** If you don't need that aradama-chan, I'll take 'em, Mihocchi\!  
**Mihono:** Thanks, Fukki. You saved me.  
**Kofuki:** Don't mention it, Mihocchi. I'm always happy to play with some aradama-chan.  
**Mihono:** Right...  
**Kiyoka:** Are you not getting enough sleep again?  
**Mihono:** Yeah... I'm no good like this, am I. Losing my focus in the middle of a fight; it's like I've gone back to how I used to be.  
**Yui:** It's dangerous spacing out in the middle of battle, but I still love you when you're like that, Mihono-chan\!  
**Chie:** Mihono-chan. If anything is bothering you, I'll hear you out, but let's focus on the battle right now, okay?  
**Mihono:** ...Alright. Thanks, Chii-nee.  
**Mihono:** After we're done with the mission and things calm down... Can I talk to you?  
**Chie:** Of course you can.  
**Kiyoka:** We might not be able to help you, but we'll hear you out too.  
**Mihono:** Thanks... All of you.  
**Mirja:** We'll wipe out the aradama in one go, and finish this mission\!  

## 9: The Reason I Can't Sleep (2)
**Mirja:** A nightmare you see nearly every night... On top of which, Kashuu Kiyomitsu's power unintentionally manifested... Then, is your power running rampant?  
**Mihono:** Rampant...  
**Chie:** ...And, since when has this been happening?  
**Mihono:** The nightmares... I don't really know. I can't remember anymore.  
**Mihono:** I think, after I started being able to use Kiyomitsu's power, that's when I first noticed it.  
**Mihono:** And, when it went rampant... It was after we searched for that Akabane sword the other day.  
**Kiyoka:** So that's why you haven't been getting sleep this whole time...  
**Kiyoka:** Seeing the same dream over and over... That's kind of scary, isn't it. And, when it went rampant... It would be dangerous if you used hachimanriki or something by accident...  
**Mihono:** I keep thinking, if I sleep, it might happen again, so I haven't been sleeping much...  
**Yui:** That dream and your power going rampant, maybe it has something to do with the Akabane sword you found on that mission?  
**Mihono:** I wouldn't know...  
**Chie:** No, I received a report on that Akabane sword, and there was nothing that seemed related to this in it.  
**Mirja:** That's right. I used kantougan to examine it as well, and it didn't have any such ability.  
**Mirja:** (That reminds me, when I visited Asakura Mihono's grandfather, Mr. Yoshizumi, he seemed to believe that the tip of Kashuu Kiyomitsu was embedded in Asakura Mihono's body...)  
**Mirja:** (If that wasn't a supposition, but the truth... Asakura Mihono would be someone joined with an okatana. Which would mean she is constantly at the risk of her power running rampant.)  
**Mirja:** (Even so, at the very least, she must have been controlling it up until now. What would have caused that to change...?\)  
**Chie:** Mirja?  
**Mirja:** ...Asakura Mihono. You are forbidden from fighting with your full strength.  
**Mirja:** At least, until our research on Kashuu Kiyomitsu makes progress, please refrain from using Kashuu Kiyomitsu's power.  
**Mihono:** I-I can handle it\! I've been fighting all this time together with Kiyomitsu\! And, I only lost control that one time\!\!  
**Chie:** Mihono-chan. I think you should do what Mirja says.  
**Chie:** These nightmares, and Kashuu Kiyomitsu's power running rampant. We can't be sure if these two things are linked, but... It's true that they're having a negative effect on you right now.  
**Mihono:** Chii-nee...  
**Kofuki:** Linked? You mean, her okatana's showing her that nightmare? I've never heard of anything like that before.  
**Kofuki:** Have any of you here seen nightmares like that?  
**Kiyoka:** I haven't... I don't think.  
**Yui:** I really only remember having good dreams.  
**Mirja:** I've never heard of it myself either, but we should proceed with the idea that there is a causal relationship in mind.  
**Mirja:** Considering Asakura Mihono, I don't think it's possible for us to be too cautious with her.  
**Mihono:** ...  
**Mihono:** (Chii-nee and Mirja-san, they're both worried about me...)  
**Mihono:** (But... Kashuu Kiyomitsu, it's the okatana my mother left me. I've been fighting with it all this time...)  
**Mihono:** (There's no way my partner could be something bad\!\)  
**Mihono:** ...I got it.  
**Mihono:** But, I can't just wait for the investigation to find something. I want to do something about it too\!  
**Mirja:** You want to do something...? I see. In that case, why not train to control Kashuu Kiyomitsu's power?  
**Mirja:** Regardless of the nightmares, it should be something beneficial to you in the future.  
**Mihono:** Alright\!  
**Kiyoka:** Hono-chan\! I'll look through a lot of records for you, okay\!  
**Mihono:** Thanks, Kiyoka\! I'll do all I can with training too\!  

## 10: Reunion on the Raid Unit
**Mihono:** Heeeey\! Kaoru-saaan\! Itomi-saaan\!  
**Sayaka:** Kaoru. Mihono is here.  
**Kaoru:** Oh-, showed up right on time, huh.  
**Kaoru:** Sorry to make you help out with us on the raid unit, Mihono. You're busy with the investigation team too, right?  
**Mihono:** No, I was feeling like I wanted to go out on a lot of missions, so this works out great\!  
**Kaoru:** Wait, were you always this serious about work?  
**Mihono:** It's not really me being serious about work, but Mirja-san told me I need to be able to control Kiyomitsu's power.  
**Kaoru:** Control it? Does that mean you messed up?  
**Mihono:** Err, well... A little.  
**Kaoru:** ...Alright. Well, do what you can. Knowing you, you'll figure something out.  
**Mihono:** Right, I'll give it my best shot\!  
**Sayaka:** Kaoru. We should leave soon.  
**Kaoru:** That's right, how about we get going.  
**Mihono:** Huh? Is it just us three on this mission?  
**Sayaka:** No. We'll meet with two toji at the site.  
**Mihono:** Ah, okay then. What kind of toji are they, Kaoru-san?  
**Kaoru:** What kind...? A habitually late delinquent, I guess.  
**Mihono:** A habitually late delinquent?  
**Kaoru:** Yep. She's serious deep down, but she always manages to show up late-.  
**Mihono:** If she's a delinquent, is she just skipping?  
**Kaoru:** Nah, she's an honest kind of person, so even if she's late, she still makes sure to show up. It's just, somehow, she always gets caught up in trouble.  
**Mihono:** (She's a delinquent, but she's honest, but she shows up late a lot... Why does that sound familiar...?\)  
**Kaoru:** Though, it'd be pretty sad if we ended up late ourselves cause we were talking about her, so let's get out there.  
**Mihono:** Ah, right\!  
**Sayaka:** HA-\!  
**Kaoru:** Looks like that's finally a quarter of them down. There's a lot more than I was thinking.  
**Sayaka:** Mm. This seems like it could take more time than I thought. But, the three of us should be fine.  
**Mihono:** That's for sure\! ...YAAA\!  
**Kaoru:** Ohh, you're doing great, Mihono. How's things with your okatana?  
**Mihono:** Uhh... Yeah, it seems okay.  
**Mihono:** (Like Kaoru-san said, I might be doing great\! Kashuu Kiyomitsu isn't showing any signs of going rampant, so I'll try holding onto this feeling\!\)  
**Mihono:** Is that sound a motorcycle...?  
**Kaoru:** Huh, she got here faster than I expected.  
**Sayaka:** A Minoseki... and Ayanokouji toji?  
**Mihono:** That bike, is that... Akira-san?  
**Kaoru:** What, you knew her? Well, she is a Minoseki toji and all, that yankee.  
**Sayaka:** Yan... kee?  
**Akira:** Oi oi, no need to start praising me up already, Kaoru.  
**Kaoru:** I wasn't praising you.  
**Mihono:** Akira-san, it's been a while\!  
**Akira:** Yeah, long time no see, Mihono. Haven't you been working hard?  
**Akira:** I've been hearin' a lot, about all your heroics. You're a total celebrity now.  
**Mihono:** Thank you very much\!  
**???:** Akira-nee-sama, is this person Asakura Mihono-san?  
**Akira:** That's the one. This's Mihono.  
**Toribane Yuuki:** Pleased to meet you, Asakura-san. My name is Toribane Yuuki.  
**Mihono:** You can just call me Mihono, Toribane-san. Nice to meet you\!  
**Yuuki:** The pleasure is all mine, Mihono-san. And please just call me Yuuki.  
**Yuuki:** That girl there... You're Itomi Sayaka-san, aren't you.  
**Sayaka:** You can call me Sayaka.  
**Yuuki:** Pleased to meet you, Sayaka-san.  
**Kaoru:** The delinquent and the lady here always make a weird combo.  
**Yuuki:** Should you really be saying that, when you make an odd combo with Ellen-san?  
**Sayaka:** Kaoru, are you close to them?  
**Kaoru:** ...Eh, it should be fine to let you know. These two are toji from Mokusa.  
**Mihono:** Akira-san, you're from Mokusa\!\?  
**Akira:** Yep. I get told a lot I don't seem like it, but I've been with Mokusa for a real long time.  
**Mihono:** I had no idea... Why did you and Yuuki join Mokusa, Akira-san?  
**Akira:** A childhood friend of mine invited us. If I get the chance, I'll introduce you to her.  
**Mihono:** Okay\!  
**Akira:** Anyway, how 'bout we beat the crap out of some aradama. Don't be slow following me in\!\!  

## 11: A Widening Crack (1)
**Yuuki:** HAAAAAAAAAA\!  
**Yuuki:** Heh. Yuuki was trained by Akira-nee-sama herself\! Aradama of this level are nothing to worry about\!  
**Kaoru:** (Yuuki's gotten a lot more capable. With this, things should go fine on her end.)  
**Kaoru:** (Akira and Sayaka are...)  
**Akira:** ORAA\!  
**Sayaka:** -\!\!  
**Kaoru:** (These two are just too reliable. Should be completely painless. As for Mihono...)  
**Aradama:** UGOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\!  
**Mihono:** Ngh\!\? I can take this much\!  
**Aradama:** GUOOOOOOOO\!\!  
**Mihono:** YAAAAA\!  
**Kaoru:** (She's struggling a bit? Feels like her concentration is falling off.)  
**Kaoru:** (...Nn?\)  
**Sayaka:** Kaoru, there's more aradama again.  
**Kaoru:** What are these, reinforcements...?  
**Akira:** What should we do, Kaoru?  
**Kaoru:** ......  
**Yuuki:** I don't think these are anything to worry ourselves over... If Mihono-san were to get serious, these aradama shouldn't be a problem at all.  
**Mihono:** Y-You mean me?  
**Yuuki:** That's right.  
**Yuuki:** You're only not showing your full strength out of some sort of consideration, isn't that right? Akira-nee-sama told me, if Mihono-san were to fight seriously, she wasn't sure if even she could win.  
**Yuuki:** And if you're that powerful, this can't be the full extent of your abilities.  
**Mihono:** It's not like I'm holding back or anything\! I'm making sure to fight seriously...  
**Mirja:** ...Asakura Mihono. You are forbidden from fighting with your full strength.  
**Mirja:** At least, until our research on Kashuu Kiyomitsu makes progress, please refrain from using Kashuu Kiyomitsu's power.  
**Mihono:** I-I can handle it\! I've been fighting all this time together with Kiyomitsu\! And, I only lost control that one time\!\!  
**Chie:** Mihono-chan. I think you should do what Mirja says.  
**Chie:** These nightmares, and Kashuu Kiyomitsu's power running rampant. We can't be sure if these two things are linked, but... It's true that they're having a negative effect on you right now.  
**Mihono:** ...I am fighting seriously.  
**Mihono:** But, I'm also trying not to use Kashuu Kiyomitsu's power until I know I can control it...  
**Yuuki:** Control... it?  
**Yuuki:** I'm not entirely sure what you mean, but... If you're wanting to control your strength, that's all the more reason you should practice using it.  
**Kaoru:** Just leave it at that, Yuuki. Mihono's got her own circumstances she's dealing with. Don't push her too much.  
**Yuuki:** ...I'm very sorry. I only wanted to see Mihono-san's strength, after Akira-nee-sama gave so much approval of her... I shouldn't have bothered her.  
**Akira:** ...Sounds like you've got something going on, Mihono. It couldn't hurt, so how 'bout you tell me about it?  
**Mihono:** ...Kashuu Kiyomitsu's power started running rampant. I wasn't even trying to use its power, but it started coming out on its own... I broke a glass...  
**Kaoru:** Your okatana's power went rampant...?  
**Sayaka:** Kaoru?  
**Kaoru:** Don't ask me. I've never heard of anything like that.  
**Akira:** I've... heard a story of something like that happening before.  
**Mihono:** You have\!\?  
**Akira:** Yeah... Sounds exactly like something my buddy told me. Though, she'd only heard that story from her mom too...  
**Mihono:** Akira-san, who's this buddy of yours? Is she...  
**Akira:** Slow down, Mihono. Their name's Hitakami Makoto. She's that childhood friend I was just telling you about.  
**Mihono:** ...Hitakami Makoto-san.  
**Akira:** That's her. If it's Makocchan, she might be able to get you through this.  
**Kaoru:** ......The Hitakami faction, huh.  
**Akira:** Mihono, you gotta trust me and use Kashuu Kiyomitsu's power. I swear we can help you.  
**Mihono:** Akira-san... I got it. I'll go do it\!\!  

## 12: A Widening Crack (2)
**Mihono:** HAAAAAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Yuuki:** ...Amazing\! So this is Mihono-san's power\!  
**Akira:** The power of Kashuu Kiyomitsu... It's even better than I was expecting...  
**Akira:** Looks like... We weren't wrong after all.  
**Sayaka:** Is that... Kashuu Kiyomitsu's power getting greater and greater?  
**Kaoru:** I've got a sort of bad feeling about this... Mihono\! That's enough\! We'll take care of the rest of the aradama together\!\!  
**Mihono:** ......  
**Kaoru:** Mihono? Oi\! Mihono\!\!  
**Mihono:** ......  
**Kaoru:** Wait, she's pointing her okatana this way...  
**Sayaka:** Kaoru, it's dangerous\!  
**Mihono:** ......\!  
**Sayaka:** Urgh\!\? I blocked it, but... it's forceful. My hands are tingling...  
**Sayaka:** Kaoru, what happened to Mihono?  
**Kaoru:** Akira\!  
**Akira:** ...Must've gone rampant. Yuuki, we're stopping Mihono\!  
**Yuuki:** Right\! Understood\!  
**Akira:** (Makocchan wasn't aiming to make Mihono go on a rampage. All we had to do was make sure of her power.)  
**Kaoru:** Hold it\!  
**Kaoru:** (I don't know what they're after, but... Akira and them are interested in Mihono. If that's the case...)  
**Kaoru:** ...You two don't get near her. Sayaka. We're gonna stop her. You up for it?  
**Sayaka:** Of course. We'll bring Mihono back to normal\!  

## 13: Strip My Flesh to Break Your Bones
**Mihono:** ......\!  
**Kaoru:** Shit, Mihono's way too damn strong...\!  
**Sayaka:** She's fast, but also hits hard... What do we do, Kaoru?  
**Kaoru:** Good question... This would go easier if someone could tough her out...  
**Akira:** Want some help?  
**Kaoru:** Don't need it\!\!  
**Sayaka:** Kaoru, it's getting desperate.  
**Kaoru:** Just a little\! Akira\!  
**Akira:** What?  
**Kaoru:** I don't want your help, but you can give me some advice\! What should we be doing\!\?  
**Akira:** Get rid of her utsushi\! After that, she'll be back to normal\!  
**Kaoru:** I'm trusting you on this\! If you're lying... You're gonna pay\!  
**Akira:** Trust me, it'll work. I wouldn't lie when my cute kouhai there's in a pinch.  
**Yuuki:** Akira-nee-sama, are we really not going to lend them assistance?  
**Akira:** Kaoru's a girl of her word. And anyway, if you went out there, Mihono'd just chop you up.  
**Yuuki:** ...If she cut me, I would cut her back.  
**Kaoru:** If she cuts you, cut her back... Really don't want to do this, but let's go with that\!  
**Kaoru:** Sayaka\! I'll get her attention\! You use that to break her utsushi\!  
**Sayaka:** Understood.  
**Kaoru:** Alright... Let's make this work\!  
**Kaoru:** This way, Mihono\!\! Don't go looking anywhere else\!\!  
**Mihono:** ......  
**Kaoru:** Yeah, just like that...  
**Mihono:** ......\!\!  
**Kaoru:** Gagh...\!  
**Yuuki:** Akira-nee-sama\! She got Kaoru-san\!  
**Akira:** Ahaha\! Strip my flesh to break your bones, huh\! Now that's fighting dirty; I like it\!  
**Kaoru:** Quit laughing\!  
**Kaoru:** Shit, this hurts...\! But, I've finally got you trapped\!\!  
**Kaoru:** Sayaka\!  
**Sayaka:** Mm\!  
**Mihono:** ......  
**Yuuki:** Nee-sama, she defended against it\!\? Even though they managed to create an opening...\!  
**Akira:** Nah, that was just another feint. She's really after...  
**Kaoru:** Your back's wide open, Mihono\!  
**Mihono:** UAAGH\!\!  
**Kaoru:** We got her utsushi off\! She'll go back to normal now, right\!\?  
**Mihono:** ......  
**Kaoru:** Hey, the hell\!\? It didn't take\!\? Sayaka, cut her again\!  
**Sayaka:** ...Mihono. She's not using utsushi.  
**Kaoru:** ...Huh?  
**Mihono:** U-Ugh...  
**Mihono:** Huh? What was I...  
**Sayaka:** Mihono, are you back to normal?  
**Mihono:** Itomi-san? ...Wait, Itomi-san, why's your okatana up like you're about to swing\!\?  
**Sayaka:** I was just... about to slash you.  
**Kaoru:** You can put it down now-. ...Sigh, that's finally over I guess.  
**Mihono:** Uhh...? Did I do something?  
**Kaoru:** You went on a full on rampage. Kashuu Kiyomitsu's power overwhelmed you and you passed out.  
**Mihono:** I passed out...?  
**Sayaka:** Mihono, you were strong. If Kaoru hadn't sacrificed herself, we wouldn't have won.  
**Mihono:** Kaoru-san sacrificed herself\!\?  
**Kaoru:** Don't turn me into a sacrifice. You just cut through me once.  
**Mihono:** ...Then, I hurt Kaoru-san...  
**Mihono:** I'm so sorry, Kaoru-san... Because of me...  
**Kaoru:** I'm sorry for not being able to stop you properly either. Don't sweat it.  
**Mihono:** ...Okay.  
**Akira:** That's right, this is my fault. I went and said some things I shouldn't have. Sorry about that, Mihono.  
**Mihono:** ...  
**Akira:** But, it's all cleared up now. Everything's like Makocchan predicted.  
**Mihono:** ...What do you mean by that?  
**Akira:** Mihono.  
**Mihono:** ...Y-Yes?  
**Akira:** We know about this thing that's happening to you. You'd better prepare yourself, before it's too late.  
**Other:** The Time Left  
**Kaoru:** Akira.  
**Akira:** ......Is this about Mihono?  
**Kaoru:** What the hell else\!\? What was all that\!\? I haven't heard anything about this\!\!  
**Akira:** ...Can't tell you.  
**Kaoru:** Are you shitting me\!\? Mihono's a close friend of ours\!\!  
**Kaoru:** And to you especially... What happened to her being your kouhai\!\?  
**Akira:** ...Even so, I can't tell you. I've got a reason I can't say anything.  
**Akira:** But...  
**Kaoru:** What.  
**Akira:** You don't have to do what I tell you, but, be sure you look after Mihono.  
**Akira:** She hasn't got a lot of time.
