## [Stage Girl - Mai: Start]: Two Triangles
**Kanami:** I can't wait to spar with all these stage girls\! If I pass this up, I'll never get another chance like it.  
**Kanami:** Honestly, ever since we came here and I saw them fighting aradama, I've wanted to spar with them-.  
**Mai:** You said the same thing back when you first saw Hiyori-chan at the tournament, didn't you, Kanami-chan.  
**Kanami:** Ehehe.  
**Hiyori:** You did? Though it sounds just like something you'd do.  
**Kanami:** Ah, Hiyori-chan. What's up?  
**Hiyori:** What do you mean, "What's up?" You're the one who said to meet here so we could spar now.  
**Kanami:** Oh yeah\! Then, let's get right to it\! I'll catch up with you later, Mai-chan\~\.  
**Mai:** Okay. Be sure not to get hurt, you two.  
**Mai:** ......  
**Mahiru:** Mai-chan?  
**Mai:** Tsuyuzaki-san? Did you need something?  
**Mahiru:** Nothing in particular, but, I was watching you with Kanami-chan. You seem close.  
**Mai:** We sure are. As soon as we met in middle school, we were fast friends. We spend lots of time together, in classes and in the dorms.  
**Mahiru:** Just like Karen-chan and I. Since the start of high school, we've always been together as roommates\! Though now there's three of us, since Hikari-chan moved in.  
**Mahiru:** What about Hiyori-chan? Her uniform is different, so she's from a different school, isn't she?  
**Mai:** We got to know Hiyori-chan during an incident at the tournament in our second year, and we've been friends ever since.  
**Mai:** It all started with Kanami-chan befriending Hiyori-chan.  
**Mahiru:** So that's what happened.  
**Kanami:** Mai-chaaan, Tsuyuzaki-saaan\! There's some aradama, so come over here\!  
**Mai:** We should go.  
**Mahiru:** Okay\!  
**Aradama:** GGGIIII\!  
**Mai:** Tsuyuzaki-san, one of the aradama went that way\! Could you get it\!  
**Aradama:** GGIIIII\!  
**Mahiru:** It's a little... scary, but I'll do it\!  
**Mahiru:** EIIIIIII\!\!  
**Mahiru:** There\! Home run\!  
**Mahiru:** It looks like we just finished cleaning up the aradama too.  
**Mai:** The aradama's really gone... You're incredible, Mahiru-san.  
**Mahiru:** It sort of looked like a ball, so I just gave it a good whack on reflex.  
**Mai:** That was only by reflex...?  
**Mai:** And not just that, but how you casually twirled around that weapon of yours like a baton as you fought...  
**Mai:** The way you moved... I think I could use it as reference in future fights.  
**Mahiru:** It's sort of embarrassing hearing you talk like that, Mai-chan.  
**Mahiru:** But, would it really be helpful learning from me?  
**Mai:** I'd like to give it a try. Will you teach me how?  
**Mahiru:** Mmm, but even if I teach you how to twirl a baton, it's not very useful for fighting, is it? I just somehow make it work...  
**Mahiru:** I know\! Mai-chan, could we try training like we're really fighting?  
**Mai:** Of course, if that's alright with you.  
**Mahiru:** Then, let's do it over there.  
**Mahiru:** I love the shining stage, but I love seeing you shine even more. I want to dance with you forever, in a duet going round and round. 99th generation, Tsuyuzaki Mahiru.  
**Mai:** That line just now had such a stylish ring to it.  
**Mahiru:** Ehehe, thank you. It makes me happy, hearing you say that. I get the feeling we're sort of alike, Mai-chan.  
**Mai:** We're alike?  
**Mahiru:** But we can talk about that after\!  
**Mahiru:** Fighting might be more of your specialty, but come try me, Mai-chan\!  
**Mai:** Here I come\!  
**Mahiru:** Ah, but I would appreciate it if you'd go a little easy on me after all.

## [Stage Girl - Mai: End]: I Love Seeing You Shine Even More
**Mahiru:** Phew... I worked up a good sweat.  
**Mahiru:** How was that? I hope it was helpful getting to see it up close at least.  
**Mai:** It was. Though, I don't know if I'll be able to put it into practice straight away.  
**Mahiru:** It would be difficult to use your okatana the same way I use my weapon, wouldn't it.  
**Mai:** I think it's incredible enough that you can use that weapon like a baton, Tsuyuzaki-san\!  
**Mahiru:** You keep flattering me so much, Mai-chan\~\.  
**Mai:** Ah, by the way. Before we started training, you told me the two of us were alike?  
**Mahiru:** Yeah, about that. I sort of had the feeling that the relationship between you, Kanami-chan, and Hiyori-chan was similar to us.  
**Mahiru:** I told you earlier, but, I'm roommates with Karen-chan, and I love her and we've always been together.  
**Mahiru:** But then... When we were in our second year of high school, Hikari-chan, Karen-chan's childhood friend, transferred in.  
**Mai:** Now that you say that, it does feel a little alike.  
**Mahiru:** At the time... I felt like Hikari-chan was stealing Karen-chan away from me... I felt really anxious for a while...  
**Mahiru:** That's why, I know I'm being a busybody, but I was kind of worried about how things are for you.  
**Mai:** Thank you for your concern. Though, I'm fine. Kanami-chan and Hiyori-chan are both close friends of mine.  
**Mahiru:** I'm glad to hear it. Sorry, for asking you something so weird.  
**Mai:** Not at all.  
**Mahiru:** Ahh, even though I'm the older one here, I'm acting kind of presumptuous. You really feel more reliable, Mai-chan.  
**Mai:** That's not true; I'm still working on that myself.  
**Mai:** Since we came to this world, you've worried about the troubles we're having more times than I can remember.  
**Mai:** You're like our reliable big sister.  
**Mahiru:** Well, I am a big sister. I have a little sister and brother at home. Maybe it's because of them, but I always find myself wanting to help others.  
**Mai:** Ah, I have two little sisters myself.  
**Mahiru:** We're the same\~\.  
**Mahiru:** I don't mind going out of my way to help people, or I guess I should say, I just feel like I need to do something.  
**Mahiru:** I used to help even more with Karen-chan in the past. Like helping her get out of bed in the mornings.  
**Mai:** I can't help myself from taking care of things for my friends either. Though, sometimes they say I'm being overprotective...  
**Mahiru:** Hmmm, but, if the person you're helping isn't bothered by it, isn't it alright?  
**Mai:** That's how I feel\!  
**Kanami:** Good work, you two-.  
**Karen:** Mahiru-chan, you sorta look like you're getting along with Mai-chan. What were you talking about?  
**Mahiru:** About how we tend to look after others, and how we're a little bit a like.  
**Hiyori:** Now that you mention it, you might be similar to each other.  
**Hikari:** But when it comes to looking after others, I think you overdo it some.  
**Mahiru:** If you could keep everything in order yourself, Hikari-chan, I wouldn't argue. Can you?  
**Hikari:** Nn...  
**Karen:** I want you to help with that, Mahiru-chan. Without you around, our room would look like a disaster zone.  
**Mahiru:** You and Hikari-chan should make sure to tidy up after yourselves, Karen-chan\~\.  
**Kanami:** Hey, Mai-chan. I've got something I want to ask from you.  
**Mai:** Like what? I'm all ears.  
**Kanami:** I was eating the sweets Daiba-san made earlier. And I started wanting to have some of your cookies.  
**Kanami:** When we get back, could you make some for me...?  
**Mai:** Mm, I'll make you some.  
**Kanami:** Nice-, thanks-\!

## [Mahouka - Mirja: Start]: Mirja and Mayumi
**Mirja:** ...I see, so that's what kind of magic you have, Saegusa Mayumi.  
**Mayumi:** That's it. At the Nine Schools Competition, I finished with a perfect bullseye. With a "bang\!\"  
**Mirja:** Going back, what is this Nine Schools Competition?  
**Mayumi:** Ah, that's right, you wouldn't have a Nine Schools Competition here.  
**Mayumi:** If I say it's... a competitive magic tournament, does that make it easy to picture?  
**Mirja:** Yes, that's easily understandable.  
**Mirja:** Hm... With that magic, you would be highly beneficial when fighting against aradama...  
**Mayumi:** Anyway, putting that aside, are you feeling peckish? It's about lunchtime, isn't it?  
**Mirja:** You're right, now would be a good time for it.  
**Mirja:** Oh, that's... Asakura Mihono with Shiba Miyuki.  
**Mayumi:** They seem to be enjoying themselves quite a lot, though, I wonder what they're talking about?  
**Mayumi:** Let's go see, Kitora-san.  
**Mirja:** You look like you're having a good time, Asakura Mihono.  
**Mihono:** Ah, Mirja-san, Mayumi-san\!  
**Mayumi:** What were you talking about with Asakura-san, Miyuki-san?  
**Miyuki:** I was just speaking a little about Onii-sama.  
**Mayumi:** About Tatsuya-kun?  
**Academy Announcement:** An appearance of aradama has been confirmed. Please prepare to sortie at once. I repeat--  
**Mirja:** Aradama\!  
**Mayumi:** We'll lend a hand. Won't we, Miyuki-san?  
**Miyuki:** Yes, of course.  
**Mirja:** ...That would be helpful.  
**Mirja:** In that case, Shiba Miyuki, I leave you with Asakura Mihono. Saegusa Mayumi will be with me.  
**Mihono/Miyuki:** Right.  
**Mayumi:** Will pairing off like this be alright?  
**Mirja:** While magic may not be able to exorcise aradama, Shiba Miyuki's magic is effective against them.  
**Mirja:** Paired with Asakura Mihono, she should be able to cover for her, just in case.  
**Mayumi:** You really are considerate of your kouhai, aren't you, Kitora-san. I had pictured you as someone more logically driven.  
**Mirja:** Logically driven...? It's true that Asakura Mihono is a valuable member of our investigation team.  
**Mirja:** Though, Saegusa Mayumi. If I had left Asakura Mihono with you, I don't believe you would let anything go wrong either.  
**Mayumi:** I'm honored to hear it. Well, let's get going.

## [Mahouka - Mirja: Start]: Elven Sniper
**Mirja:** Now then, Saegusa Mayumi. The two types of magic you explained to me before... Magic Bullet Shooter and Multi-Scope.  
**Mirja:** With those two, we should be able to suppress aradama with ease.  
**Mirja:** After all, you are capable of carrying out a one-sided assault on aradama from distance without needing to enter their range.  
**Mayumi:** That's true.  
**Mirja:** Then I will be the one to perform the finishing blow...  
**Aradama:** GGGGGOOOOOUUUUU\!\!  
**Mirja:** -\! Saegusa Mayumi\!  
**Mayumi:** Of course.  
**Aradama:** GUOOO\!\?  
**Aradama:** GYAAA\!\?  
**Aradama:** OOOOO\!\?  
**Mirja:** She took care of three simultaneously..  
**Mayumi:** Two more are coming from the front, and another three from the right hand side. I'll pin them down, so could you please finish off those three?  
**Mirja:** I'm on it\!  
**Mirja:** HAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Mirja:** (A perfect bullseye, hm... Her precision is frightening.)  
**Mirja:** ...There's nothing that could be more reassuring.  
**Mirja:** YAAAAAAAAAAAA\!  
**Mihono:** We finished suppressing the aradama, Mirja-san\! Miyuki-san was really incredible\!  
**Mirja:** We can speak about that more later. Then, when we next meet.  
**Mayumi:** It sounds like Asakura-san and Miyuki-san safely suppressed their aradama too.  
**Mirja:** Yes, though Asakura Mihono's strange excitement has me concerned...  
**Mayumi:** You think she might have fallen in love with Miyuki-san's magic?  
**Mirja:** That might be the case. Though, you were excellent yourself, Saegusa Mayumi.  
**Mirja:** I didn't think that, just by having long range support, it would make such a dramatic difference in efficiency...  
**Mayumi:** Would you try recreating it after you wake up from this dream?  
**Mirja:** That would be difficult to accomplish. Multi-Scope and Magic Bullet Shooter.  
**Mirja:** I believe this was only possible because of how skilled you are at manipulating the both of them.  
**Mayumi:** Thank you for the compliments, Kitora-san.  
**Mirja:** I meant it. That aside, the aradama interrupted us when we were about to have lunch just now.  
**Mayumi:** They did; I'm famished at this point. Even though it's a dream. It's a strange feeling, isn't it?  
**Mirja:** I feel the same. What do you say we find something to eat close by?  
**Mayumi:** I'm all for it\!
