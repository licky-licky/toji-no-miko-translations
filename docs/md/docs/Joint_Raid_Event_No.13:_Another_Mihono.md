**Kiyoka:** \.\.\.Hono-chan\! We were so worried about you\.  
**Mihono:** Ahaha, sorry about that, Kiyoka\.  
**Hana:** That's\.\.\. Mihono alright\.  
**Yui:** Yeah\.\.\. Ahhh\.\.\. Thank godd\.\.\.  
**Chie:** Mihono-chan, does it hurt anywhere\? Do you feel funny\?  
**Mihono:** I'm fine, I'm fine\! I feel great\! And anyway, Chii-nee\.  
**Chie:** Hm\?  
**Mihono:** If you keep standing there, you're gonna get hurt\?  
**Chie:** Eh\?  
**Everyone:** \!\?  
**Chie:** \.\.\.Mihono-ch\.\.\.\?  
**Yui:** Chie-san\!\? Why\!\? Why would you do that to her\!\!  
**Mihono:** Why\? Cause I wanted to kill her\.\.\. I guess\!  
**Mirja:** Get back, Yamashiro Yui\!\!  
**Mirja:** Ggh\.\.\. Are you, alright\.\.\.\?  
**Yui:** Y-Yeah\.\.\. but, Mirja-san, you're--\!\!  
**Akira:** ORAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Mihono:** Whoa\.  
**Mihono:** Geez, what'd you come at me like that for\? That's dangerous\.  
**Kiyoka:** P-Please, stop it\!\! That's Hono-chan\!\!  
**Akira:** Dumbass\! What about that is Mihono\!\? That's\.\.\. just Kanayamahime\!\!  
**Kiyoka:** \.\.\.\!  
**Akira:** Forget it; if you're just gonna stand around, go get Chie and Mirja out of here\!\!  
**Ellen:** \.\.\.Akira's right\. Kaoru, give me a hand with them\.  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.Yeah\.  
**Mai:** I'll help with them too\!  
**Mai:** Kanami-chan, Hiyori-chan, Sayaka-chan\. I know it'll be hard, but\.\.\. Could you three handle Mihono-chan\.  
**Sayaka:** \.\.\.Okay\.  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.\.\.\.Kanami\.  
**Kanami:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Time out, time out\!  
**Mihono:** Even I couldn't take on all of you at once right now\!  
**Akira:** You think we're letting you get away\?  
**Mihono:** Mmm\.\.\. Yeah\! I think I can get away, at least\.  
**Mihono:** So anyway\.\.\. Later, guys\. I'll get even stronger next time we see each other\!  

## 2: Each of Their Feelings
Several weeks later\.

  
**Toji:** She's just\.\.\. too much\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Hmm, it's hard to tell how much stronger I'm getting just from cutting up weak people\.  
**Mihono:** Maybe it's about time I went to see everybody\.  
**Yui:** Hey again-\.  
**Mirja:** Yamashiro Yui\. I'm sure I told you there's no need for you to visit me anymore\?  
**Yui:** I'm not the kind of girl who'd stop coming to see you just because you said I didn't have to\.  
**Mirja:** Of course not\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.I heard about it\. There's been more victims\.  
**Yui:** \.\.\.  
**Mirja:** Great aradama Kanayamahime is only getting stronger\. There's no time for you to waste--  
**Yui:** Please, just stop\!\!  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.  
**Yui:** Do we have to talk about that\? Couldn't we talk about something nicer\?  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.Would this have been easier for you if I hadn't saved you from Kanayamahime then\?  
**Yui:** --\!  
**Yui:** \.\.\.Maybe\. If you hadn't\.\.\. I wouldn't have been put on the Kanayamahime suppression assignment, would I\.  
**Mirja:** Yamashiro Yui\.\.\.  
**Yui:** I'm just kidding\! So please, don't look so sad\. You're ruining your beautiful face, okay\?  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.Will you be able to destroy Kanayamahime\?  
**Yui:** I'll be saving her\.  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.Huh\?  
**Yui:** Ever since that day, there's been more and more reports of aradama outbreaks, hasn't there\?  
**Yui:** Yesterday, I went to see Miku\.\.\. my little sister, in the hospital\. And, everybody there was so afraid\.\.\.  
**Yui:** There's no way Mihono-chan wants things to be like this\. So, I'm going to save her\.  
**Yui:** No matter\.\.\. how this all turns out\.  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.I see\.  
**Kofuki:** So\? How long're you gonna keep moping around here for\?  
**Kiyoka:** \.\.\.  
**Kofuki:** Like, if you hate it that much, just get yourself taken off the assignment\.  
**Kiyoka:** \.\.\.Are you really okay with this, Kofuki-san\?  
**Kofuki:** Why wouldn't I be\?  
**Kiyoka:** That's\.\.\. horrible of you\.\.\.  
**Tsugumi:** Shichinosato-san can be a very stubborn person, can't she-\.  
**Kofuki:** \.\.\.The hell's that supposed to mean\.  
**Tsugumi:** \.\.\.If you were your usual self, you would have run out looking for her as soon as you could, wouldn't you\?  
**Tsugumi:** And yet, even while you keep saying it's just another mission, you've been spending all this time keeping Musumi-san company\.  
**Kofuki:** Don't talk like\.\.\. you\.\.\.  
**Tsugumi:** Did you not want to go have fun with Kanayamahime\?  
**Kofuki:** \.\.\.I don't know, okay\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** Kofuki-san\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** \.\.\.That's right\. None of us want to have to\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** Eh\?  
**Kofuki:** Huh\?  
**Kiyoka/Kofuki:** --\!\!  
**Tsugumi:** What is it\?  
**Kiyoka:** It's about Chie-san, in the hospital\.\.\.  
**Kofuki:** \.\.\.It says she disappeared out of her room\.
