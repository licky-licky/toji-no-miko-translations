Let's Vacation! A Tropical Resort Festival!
===========================================

## 1: Let's Go on a Tropical Holiday
**Mihono:** Chii-nee, Mirja-san\! On the break that's coming up, let's go on a trip together\!  
**Mirja:** Hm, I don't see why not\. I wouldn't mind going\.  
**Chie:** I'm fine with it too\. Was there anyplace you wanted to go, Mihono-chan\?  
**Mihono:** I didn't really have anywhere in mind\. I was just thinking, it'd be nice if the three of us could go somewhere\.  
**Mirja:** I see\.\.\. Then, how does a sword appreciation tour sound\? It would be a nice way to learn while relaxing\.  
**Mihono:** If we're going on a trip, I don't want to have to do any learning\!  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.That's a shame\.  
**Chie:** Don't look so down, okay\?  
**Chie:** Hmm, then, would it be alright if I looked up someplace for us to go\?  
**Mihono:** Sure\! Go right ahead, Chii-nee\!  
**Chie:** \.\.\.I told them that, but it's hard finding the right place to visit\.  
**Chie:** Since we're taking time off, I'd like to go somewhere we haven't been on missions\.\.\.  
**Chie:** But thinking of it that way makes this pretty difficult\.  
**Chie:** \.\.\.Ah, they're even doing an event here too\.\.\. I'm sure Mihono-chan would like this, but\.\.\. Oh, but, the prize is\.\.\.  
**Chie:** Okay\!  
**Mirja:** A tropical resort\.\.\. is that it\?  
**Mihono:** You're the best, Chii-nee\! When you think \"vacation\", tropical is the way to go\!  
**Chie:** Fufu, thanks\. But you know, that's not all there is to it\.  
**Chie:** Here, take a look at this\.  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.A dance competition\?  
**Chie:** Mmhm\.  
**Chie:** It's a sort of small scale local event\.\.\. Don't you think that sounds like fun\?  
**Mihono:** Yeah\! That'll be fun for sure\! We should try it\!  
**Mirja:** So long as the two of you are interested, I have no problems with going there\.  
**Chie:** Fufu, you should look at this part, Mirja\.  
**Mirja:** Hm\?  
**Chie:** See, the prize for the dance competition is a coupon you can use locally\.  
**Chie:** And, that coupon can get you\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** I see now\. You don't need to say the rest\.  
**Mirja:** You're saying there's some place I could use the coupon there to view swords at a discount\?  
**Chie:** You got it\!  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.We should place our entry right away\.  
**Mirja:** We're going to win this dance competition\!  
**Chie/Mihono:** Yeah-\!  

## 2: Trouble's Brewing\!\?
**Mihono:** We made it to the dance competition\! Mmmm, the sea breeze feels so good\!  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.Though, did we really have to come check it out before it started\?  
**Mirja:** Of course we did\. We can't afford to be lost on the day of the competition\.  
**Chie:** Mirja\.\.\. You're serious about this, aren't you\.  
**Mirja:** Yes, I am serious\.  
**Mirja:** If we're going to be participating, won't it be more fun that way\?  
**Dance Tournament Organizer:** Hmm, this isn't good\.\.\. Are they going to make it in time for the dance competition\?   
**Mirja:** Hm\? That person is\.\.\. It looks like there's some kind of trouble\.  
**Mihono:** I'll go ask them about it\!  
**Mirja:** No, let's all go\.  
**Mihono:** Okay\!  
**Mihono:** Um, is something wrong\?  
**Dance Tournament Organizer:** Hm\? Who are you\.\.\.\?  
**Chie:** We're entering the dance tournament\. We came here to take a look before the event started, but\.\.\. is something wrong\?  
**Dance Tournament Organizer:** Oh, did you hear that\.\.\.\? The truth is\.\.\. Near here, some aradama appeared\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** There's aradama\!\?  
**Dance Tournament Organizer:** Yes, it's a little ways away, but, if the worst happens\.\.\.  
**Dance Tournament Organizer:** With this going on, we've gotten a flood of people asking if we should delay or even cancel the dance tournament\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** That's true; if aradama have appeared, it's no time to be holding a tournament\.  
**Dance Tournament Organizer:** Right\.  
**Mihono:** But then, you should let us take care of it\! We're all toji\!  
**Dance Tournament Organizer:** Ah, that won't\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** That's not going to be possible, Asakura Mihono\.  
**Mihono:** Why not\?\! Sure, we only came here on vacation, but now's not the time for that\!  
**Chie:** Mihono-chan, we didn't bring our okatana with us, right\?  
**Mihono:** Ah, oh yeah\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** Did you remember now\?  
**Mihono:** Yeah\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Still, then all we have to do is go right back and get our okatana, or have somebody bring them here\!   
**Dance Tournament Organizer:** Um\.\.\. There's no need for that\. We already requested toji from the Sword Administration Bureau, and they should already be going to handle it\.  
**Dance Tournament Organizer:** Though, we haven't heard from them yet\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** So it depends on those toji then\.  
**\?\?\?:** We got it all taken care of\.  

## 3: Let's Enter it Together\!
**Akira:** We're all done here\.\.\. Wait, what's Mihono and them doing here\?  
**Mihono:** You're the toji who came here, Akira-san\!\?  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.Hello\. I'm here too\.  
**Mihono:** Hirona's here too\!  
**Mirja:** How have you been, Nitta Hirona\?  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.I'm fiiine\.  
**Hirona:** Akira-san worked hard with the aradama, so it helped a lot\.  
**Akira:** If you'd worked a little harder we could've had this done way sooner\.  
**Hirona:** Ehh, but wouldn't that be wasted energyy\?  
**Chie:** Fufu, I see you're doing the same as ever, Hirona-chan\.  
**Akira:** So\? What're you all doing here\? Where's the rest of you\?  
**Mihono:** The three of us came here on a trip\! The others couldn't get time off for it\.  
**Akira:** Ahh, so that's why\. I bet Yui was real jealous, wasn't she\?  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.She was\. She threw a complete tantrum over it, in fact\.  
**Akira:** Sounds like Yui alright\. Well, we took care of those aradama\. Have fun on your vacation\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.What should we bring back for souvenirs\?  
**Akira:** Let's just get food\. And don't get something weird just cause you think Yuuki'll like it\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.Did you want me to make a joke\?  
**Akira:** Shut up\.  
**Mihono:** Hang on a minute, Akira-san\. You and Hirona should be in the dance competition too\!  
**Akira:** Huh\? A dance competition\?  
**Mihono:** We're doing the dance competition here\! So we should do it together\! It'll be fun for sure\!   
**Akira:** You're kinda springing this on me out of nowhere\.\.\. Wouldn't that be hard for them to fit us in too\?  
**Dance Competition Organizer:** No, that's absolutely alright\. We'd love to have you two toji with us\.  
**Mihono:** See\!  
**Akira:** \.\.\.Look, dancing's not really my thing, so I think we're just gonna leave after all\.  
**Hirona:** In that case, please let both of us join in\.  
**Akira:** \.\.\.Hah\? What're you up to\? I could've sworn you hated going out of your way for anything\.  
**Hirona:** It's not like I hate going out of my way for things\.  
**Hirona:** I think it's important to weigh the benefits doing them, but if it seems fun I'll do it too\.  
**Hirona:** And wouldn't it be funny to see Akira-san dancing\? I think that would be a great souvenir for Yuuki-san and Makoto-san\.  
**Chie:** Looks like we have more rivals now, Mirja\.  
**Mirja:** It seems like it\. We can't afford to lose\.  

## 4: The Dance Competition
The day of the dance competition\.

  
**Spectators:** YEAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH\!\!  
**Chie:** They're all so worked up\.  
**Mirja:** I know\. They said we could choose from any genre we liked, but\.\.\. they really went through with it\.  
**Mirja:** From orthodox dance routines to a loach-catching dance\.\.\. And they're all impressive opponents\.  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.  
**Chie:** What's wrong, Mihono-chan\?  
**Mihono:** When I think about how we're about to go up\.\.\. I'm getting a little nervous\.  
**Chie:** You don't have to be so tense over this\. We can just have fun with it, Mihono-chan\.  
**Mihono:** But\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** I'm perfectly fine with that, Asakura Mihono\.  
**Mirja:** Of course I would like the coupon, but I'll still go to view the swords even without it\.  
**Mirja:** This is our vacation, after all\. Let's enjoy our dance\.  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.Okay\!  
**Spectators:** WHOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH\!\!  
**Mirja:** It seems to be Inago Akira and Nitta Hirona's turn\.  
**Mihono:** I kinda dragged them into this\.\.\. Do Akira-san and Hirona actually know how to dance\?  
**Chie:** They're getting started\.  
**Akira:** HAHH\!\!  
**Hirona:** --\!\!  
**Mihono:** Are they sparring\? No wait, it's more like\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** They patterned their dance around training\. It's a little different from a proper dance, but\.\.\. I see, so that's one way of going about this\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.MPH-\!\!  
**Akira:** ORAHH\!\!  
**Spectators:** YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH\!\!  
**Chie:** They're incredible\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Yeah\.\.\. Seeing Akira-san and Hirona dance is sorta making me feel fired up\!  
**Mihono:** Let's give it our best shot, Chii-nee\! Mirja-san\!  

## 5: Announcing the Results\!
**Spectators:** WHOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Akira:** Hey, if they're gonna get that excited, that's fine by me\! We did pretty good, Hirona\!  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.Thank youu\. I gave it my allll\.  
**Akira:** I wish you'd always put in that much effort though\.  
**Hirona:** Ehh-, but aren't I always working hard\?  
**Akira:** Oh, Mihono and them are up\. What kinda dance are they doing\?  
**Hirona:** The song's startingg\. It's\.\.\. an idol song\?  
**Spectators:** YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH\!\!  
**Akira:** Oh yeah, that reminds me, they did idol stuff for a mission before, didn't they\.  
**Hirona:** That explains why their dancing is so neat-\.  
**Hirona:** But\.\.\. that's not the reason everyone's excited, is it\.  
**Akira:** Yeah\.  
**Mihono:** Uwah\!\? Sorry, I messed up the routine\!\!  
**Mirja:** Don't worry, stay calm\. Setouchi Chie, please work in a solo dance\.  
**Chie:** I'm on it\!  
**Spectators:** WHOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Akira:** Mihono's really screwing things up out there, but she looks like she's having a lot of fun\.  
**Akira:** Take a video, Hirona\. We'll show everybody later\.  
**Hirona:** Okaaay\.  
**Hirona:** Though\.\.\. they'll be hard to beat\.  
**Akira:** What, you actually wanted to win this\?  
**Hirona:** If I'm here, I want to win\. That's the best returns for our effort\.  
**Akira:** You got that right\. If you're doing something, you better win it\.  
**Hirona:** I thought you would understand, Akira-san\.  
**Akira:** Sure do\.  
**Akira:** But hey, for now, let's cheer Mihono and them on\.  
**Dance Competition Host:** The overall winner is\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** We didn't make it to the winners' stand\.\.\. It's cause I messed up, isn't it\.\.\.  
**Akira:** Hey, you tried your best and that's all that matters, right\! I really liked how you danced, Mihono\.  
**Mihono:** Thanks for that, Akira-sannn\.\.\.  
**Dance Competition Host:** Now then, we'll be announcing the special award\. There were two teams who achieved this prize\!  
**Dance Competition Host:** The team of Asakura Mihono-san, Setouchi Chie-san, and Kitora Mirja-san, and the team of Inago Akira-san and Nitta Hirona-san\!  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.Special award\?  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.We did it-\.

**Mihono:** Yeah\!
