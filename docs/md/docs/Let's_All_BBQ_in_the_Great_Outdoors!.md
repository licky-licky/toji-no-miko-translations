## 1: The BBQ Boss Is Here to Help
**Mihono:** We're at the campsiiite\~\! Barbecue, barbecue\~\!  
**Mihono:** Look at all the people around\. Well, it is summer break\. Something smells really tasty too\!  
**Ellen:** You're just raring to go today, aren't you, Mihomiho\.  
**Mihono:** Heh heh heh-\. That's cause I've been waiting so long for this barbecue\! I used up all my money getting the best meat I could buy, so you better start working up an appetite now, okay-\?  
**Chie:** Mihono-chan\.\.\. Will you be alright with no spending money\?  
**Mihono:** Since I live at the dorms, I just have to hang on a little bit till payday comes, and it'll all be fine\!  
**Kiyoka:** You get really fired up about these things sometimes, don't you Hono-chan\. We should follow her example\.  
**Mirja:** The best meat\.\.\. My heart is full of anticipation, but it could be dangerous for us all to behave exactly as Asakura Mihono\.  
**Uraga Nao:** Mirja told me all about you all; you really do seem like a fun bunch\~\. I think I lucked out tagging along for a refresher here\~\.  
**Mirja:** Uraga Nao, we need you to manage the barbecue for us, so go right ahead and show off your talents\.  
**Nao:** When you put it like that, you'll give them the wrong kind of expectations\~\. I'm not a barbecue master or anything, okay\?  
**Mirja:** That's not true\. You're our powerful backup here\.  
**Kiyoka:** When the investigation team tries to do the cooking\.\.\. Somebody slips in their own special ingredients, and it turns into a mystery hot pot\.\.\. Or the curry ends up getting burnt\.  
**Chie:** If everyone would just do as I tell them\.\.\. Everything would turn out fine, you know\.\.\.\?  
**Ellen:** But so long as you don't go overboard, barbecuing is just as simple as cooking it\.  
**Nao:** You're right, there are lots of things you can easily barbecue, but to get the tastiest results, you can't stop working the spatula, you see\~\?  
**Mihono:** Uraga-san, are you like a hot pot boss but for the barbecue\? [Someone who gets very bossy when cooking at a hot pot\.\]  
**Mirja:** She is\. However, she's a hot pot boss as well, so she's both boss of the hot pot and barbecue\.  
**Nao:** Hey, you keep giving them the wrong idea\~\. I'm not the boss of anything\~\. Just someone who wants to cook stuff as delicious as it can be\.  
**Mihono:** With a barbecue boss here, my meat's going to be the best it can be\.\.\. Ehehe\.  
**Nao:** \.\.\.Looks like it's no use trying to stop this misunderstanding now, is it\~\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** Are we going to start getting the barbecue set up already\? Or, since we're here, should we play around by the water first\?  
**Mirja:** That's an idea as well\. Though I would like to consider the most efficient timing of heating up the barbecue\.  
**Kiyoka:** What do we do\.\.\. Hono-chan, I just realized something important\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** What's that\?  
**Kiyoka:** Everyone here today\.\.\. Besides us\.\.\. They're all so big\.  
**Kiyoka:** I heard that development is linked to what you eat\.\.\. It might be a good idea to try eating exactly like how they do\.\.\.\!  
**Kiyoka:** Hono-chan, this is our chance to get bigger\!  
**Mihono:** Bigger\? Like how\? Anyway, the meat\! We have to get the meat ready\! You should eat some meat too, Kiyoka\!  
**Mihono:** Ahh, I can't wait to see that meat start sizzling-\.  
**Kiyoka:** (Hono-chan\.\.\. Meat is the only thing on her mind right now\.\.\.\)  
**Nao:** It's nice and warm out, so an afternoon nap might be nice too\~\.  
**Ellen:** Now that would be refreshing\. If Kaoru could hear you, she'd be jealous, fufu\.  
**Kiyoka:** (Mmmm, \"A sleeping child is a growing child\"\.\.\. What if that saying is true\?\)  
**Scream:** UWAAAA\.\.\.\!\? A-ARADAMAAA\!  
**Mihono:** \! Guys, let's go\!  
**Nao:** Are you hurt\~\? Is anyone injured\?  
**Barbecue Goer:** It's nothing serious\.\.\. But, the food for the barbecue\.\.\.  
**Nao:** The food\?  
**Barbecue Goer:** I don't know why, but\.\.\. They took most of the food\.  
**Mirja:** We saw this strange pattern before, with the chocolate stealing aradama\. That behavior may have spread\.  
**Chie:** It's a good thing nobody was hurt, at least\.  
**Mihono:** They're never getting away with stealing food from the barbecue\! Let's beat them all and get it back\!  
**Mihono:** Ah, but first, I have to make sure my meat doesn't get stolen too\!  
**Kiyoka:** Right, it's important we stay careful\.  
**Mihono:** Wha\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** What\? What's wrong\?  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.It's gone\! My meat\!\! My meat's not here\!\!  
**Mihono:** IT'S GOOOONE\!\?  

## 2: Search for the Stolen Meat
**Mihono:** Pant\.\.\. Pant\.\.\. Where's the aradama\? Where's my meat\?  
**Mirja:** Get a hold of yourself, Asakura Mihono\. For the time being, we've cleared the nearby area of aradama\.  
**Kiyoka:** Hono-chan\.\.\. I'm amazed how focused she is on this\.  
**Ellen:** She's beaten the most aradama by herself, hasn't she\? Mihomiho's potential is off the charts-\.  
**Nao:** The spectrum meter is faintly reacting, but since we helped everyone evacuate for now, it should be safe\~\.  
**Nao:** The toji in charge of this area have arrived too\.  
**Chie:** I understand how you must feel, Mihono-chan, but if you keep fighting like this you'll burn yourself out\. You can't afford to push yourself too hard\.  
**Mihono:** Okay\.\.\. Ahh, I'm feeling hungry now\.\.\. If this was going to happen, we should've done the barbecue as soon as we got here-\.  
**Mihono:** Aradama must be meat eaters after all\! When I was in Chinatown, they showed up at the meat bun shop too\!  
**Ellen:** Have you ever actually seen them eating though\? From my Papa and Grandpa's research, aradama shouldn't eat meat or other foods\.  
**Mihono:** Ehh-\!\? So wait, they took it even though they aren't gonna eat it\!\? They're just being mean\!  
**Chie:** That's the part that makes you upset, hmm\.\.\.  
**Nao:** If I had my favorite food stolen out from under me right as I was looking forward to it, I think I'd be just as upset as Asakura-san\~\.  
**Nao:** Especially the mandarin oranges I have sent to me straight from the farm every winter\. I'd hate to lose those\.  
**Mirja:** Oh, do you mean the ones we take when we stop by your room from time to time\?  
**Nao:** The ones I put out for you are just from the supermarket\. Besides those, I always get just a few shipments of first rate mandarins\~\. But you're not getting any\~\.  
**Mirja:** I'll look forward to this year's winter then\. And spread the word to Mizushina Kinuka\.  
**Nao:** Hey, Mirja\!\?  
**Kiyoka:** You two get along so well\. I hardly ever see Mirja-san teasing with someone like this\!  
**Nao:** Well, we are senpai and kouhai from the same school, and we've been hanging out together for a long time too\~\.  
**Kiyoka:** I think it's nice to have that kind of relationship\.  
**Mihono:** That should be enough of a break, right\?  
**Mihono:** We have to get that meat back, so everyone who came here to barbecue today can go home with good memories\!  
**Chie:** That's right, we have to work our hardest\.  
**Mihono:** And no matter what, I'm not giving up on my meat\!\!  
**Kiyoka:** It's no good if we don't get your meat, Hono-chan\. It looked so delicious, and this was the perfect chance to make some observations during the barbecue\. We can't afford to lose it\!  
**Mihono:** Let's go, Kiyoka\! We'll beat the aradama and barbecue\! We're coming to get you, my meaaaaat\!  
**Kiyoka:** Eh\? Kyaaaaa\!\? Hono-chan\.\.\. You don't have to drag meee\.\.\.\!  
**Ellen:** They'll make us look bad at this rate\. We have to help make sure everyone can have a fun barbecue too\!  
**Chie:** I don't know why Mihono-chan is acting so unreasonably\. I have to keep a close eye on her, as her onee-san\. Mm\!  
**Mirja:** We should follow as well, Uraga Nao\.  
**Nao:** Hmm, seeing everyone run off all willy nilly like this is making me wonder a little what the point of teaching everyone battle formations is\~\.  
**Nao:** In spite of all that, Asakura-san and them still manage to function as a team somehow\. It's beyond me\~\.  
**Mirja:** About that, I do hold a similar impression, however, what matters most is our work right now\.  
**Nao:** Ah, wait for me, Mirja\~\.  

## 3: Let's BBQ\!\!
**Mihono:** WELCOME BACK\! MY MEAT\!  
**Ellen:** And nobody got hurt by the aradama either\. All the food that was stolen got recovered, so everything turned out okay\.  
**Ellen:** We put the smiles back on the faces of everyone who came here to barbecue\.  
**Kiyoka:** They gave us all sorts of food to eat as thanks too\.  
**Ellen:** We have to make the most of their generosity by enjoying our trip here to the fullest\.  
**Mihono:** With that out of the way, let's grill the meat\!  
**Nao:** Hold your horses\~\. You can't go spreading the meat across the whole grill\. I know you want to grill it all as soon as you can, but still\~\.  
**Mirja:** If we want the meat to be cooked all the way through, shouldn't we begin grilling them as soon as possible\?  
**Nao:** That's true, but we have to arrange things depending on the heat\. Where there's lots of charcoal packed together, where it's spread out, and where there's hardly any\.  
**Nao:** The highest temperature areas are reserved for the meat, and the vegetables that heat poorly\. We can put the Shiitake and peppers and the like where there's remaining heat on the sides\.  
**Mihono:** That makes sense\.\.\. Leave it to the BBQ Boss\!  
**Mirja:** I see I was right to call you here\.  
**Nao:** I'm not a commanding officer for nothing, you know\~\. You need a plan for everything, even cooking up delicious meat, alright\?  
**Nao:** For example, when you see it getting burned from the high heat, you should move it somewhere with a lower temperature\~\.  
**Nao:** And then, you wait until it's cooked all the way to the center\~\. That'll make the outside nice and crunchy, and the inside\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** All juicyyy\!  
**Nao:** You got it\~\. Anyway, I'll tell you which ones are ready to eat\.  
**Nao:** The ones right in the middle are good to go\. The foil wrapped mushrooms next to it should be fine too\~\.  
**Ellen:** Here, Mihomiho\. You eat this one\.  
**Mihono:** Can I\?  
**Chie:** Of course; you're the one who brought it for us\. You worked the hardest to suppress the aradama too\.  
**Mihono:** Then\.\.\. I'm digging in\~\! \.\.\.Omfh\!  
**Mihono:** MMMM\~\~\~\~\!\!  
**Kiyoka:** I can tell how tasty it is just from the look on Hono-chan's face\.\.\. Gulp\.  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.You don't need words when it comes to meat\. Eat up, everyone, come on\! Come on, Uraga-san, Kiyoka\!  
**Kiyoka:** Th-Then\.\.\. H-Here I go, Hono-chan\!  
**Kiyoka:** \.\.\.\!\!  
**Kiyoka:** S-So good\.\.\. It's so good, Hono-chan\!  
**Mihono:** Right\?  
**Nao:** This really is some good meat\~\. I'll keep on grilling them up for you, okaaay\~\.  
**Mihono:** And we'll keep on eating them-\! Omh\.\.\. Ahh\~, I'm so glad to be here right now\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** Nothing beats eating meat under a clear blue sky\. Chew chew\.\.\. Delicious\~\.  
**Ellen:** If only Kaoru could have come along\.  
**Chie:** I know, Kaoru-san is always so hard at work\.\.\. Chew chew\.  
**Mihono:** Urgh\.\.\. Huh\.\.\.\?  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.With such a deep flavor\.\.\. I doubt I could ever tire of eating it\. Chew chew\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** Nn\.\.\.\? I feel\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** However\.\.\. It would be unfair to leave Uraga Nao in charge of all the preparations, so we should assist her as we enjoy ourselves\.  
**Nao:** Thank you\~\. Ah, be sure not to use the tongs you use to pick up the meat with any of the other food, okay\?  
**Mirja:** Understood\.  
**Mirja:** By the way, Asakura Mihono, Musumi Kiyoka\. Is something wrong\? You haven't moved your chopsticks or joined the conversation for some time now\.  
**Mihono/Kiyoka:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** That's because\.\.\. When I eat the meat, there's this weird feeling around my chest\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** Me too\.\.\.\! That's what it feels like\.\.\.  
**Chie:** Oh goodness, do you have heartburn\? Is it because you've been eating nothing but meat, I wonder\?  
**Mihono:** Th-This is that heartburn stuff\!\? I think this is the first time I've had it\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** And now I can't even eat my meat I worked so hard for\~, I don't believe this\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** Ah-\! Look, Hono-chan\.\.\.\!  
**Kiyoka:** Chie-san, Ellen-san, and them\.\.\. They're eating all kinds of food besides the meat\!  
**Kiyoka:** We should try eating the same as they do for now\.  
**Kiyoka:** It could help with our alliance activities, and we can cleanse our palates a little\. Maybe after a while, we'll be able to eat meat without getting heartburn\?  
**Mihono:** Th-That sounds like it could work\?  
**Kiyoka:** Then, let's not wait around\.\.\. It's time to take action\!  
**Kiyoka:** Chie-san, what you're eating, is that cheese fondue\? Could we have some\?  
**Chie:** Of course\. But, since you're feeling heartburn, shouldn't you take a short breather\? I'll be sure to set aside some food for you two\.  
**Kiyoka:** No thanks, I feel fine\! When it comes to our objective\.\.\. Girls have another stomach for this\! Right, Hono-chan\?  
**Mihono:** Y-Yeah\.  
**Nao:** We have potatoes, pumpkin, bread, and mushrooms here, so go ahead and grab a mouthful\~\.  
**Mihono:** Hot\.\.\. It's hot\! But the cheese is so yummy that I can eat it normally\!  
**Kiyoka:** The cherry tomatoes go great with it too\! I think\.\.\. This is going to work, Hono-chan\.  
**Mihono:** Yeah\!  
**Mihono:** (If I just wait a bit for the meat\.\.\. I'm sure I can eat it like normal too\!\)  
**Mirja:** (Strangely, it seems Asakura Mihono and Musumi Kiyoka have been copying whatever we eat for some time now\?\)  
**Mirja:** (No, there can't be any deeper reason for it\. Sometimes food simply appears tastier after watching another eat it\.\)  
**Mihono:** Alright, time to dig into the meat again\! That was just a fluke before\!  
**Mihono:** When it comes to meat\.\.\. Where there's a will, there's a way\!  
**Mirja:** (It seems I was mistaken after all\.\)  
**Mihono:** That sizzling sound it makes is so nice\. Think it's ready-\? They said to be careful not to overcook it\.  
**Mihono:** You're having some too, right Kiyoka\?  
**Kiyoka:** Right\.\.\.\! Thank you, Hono-chan\! Let's give it a try\!  
**Mihono/Kiyoka:** Ahm\.\.\.\!  
**Mihono:** Mmmggh\.\.\.\.\.\!\?  
**Kiyoka:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Why\.\.\. Why\.\.\.\!\? Even though it's so good\! What's with this\!\? It's like my chest is saying no to the meat\!  
**Kiyoka:** \.\.\.Hono-chan\.\.\.\! I'm feeling it\.\.\. too\.\.\.\!  
**Mihono:** We can eat everything else okay, but\.\.\. Uuu\.\.\. My meat\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** And Chie-san and the others are still eating the meat without a care in the world\.\.\. Why is it only us\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** Don't tell me\.\.\. If your breasts grow big enough, you can eat without getting heartburn\?  
**Kiyoka:** No wait, don't they say that you have to eat a lot of meat to grow bigger\!\?  
**Kiyoka:** Then that means\.\.\. If we can't eat because of heartburn, then we won't\.\.\.\!  
**Mihono:** All I wanted to do was eat the yummy meat\.\.\.\!  
**Mihono/Kiyoka:** \.\.\.WHY DID THIS HAVE TO HAPPEN\~\~\!\?
