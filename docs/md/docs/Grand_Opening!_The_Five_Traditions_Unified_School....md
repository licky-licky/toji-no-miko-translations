## 1: The Unified School Festival Executive Committee
**Yume:** Whoa, this classroom's full of people\!  
**Yomi:** All student members of the executive committee have assembled here.  
**Maki:** That's right. We should get this meeting started straight away.  
**Maki:** Members of the executive committee, thank you all for gathering today to discuss the Five Traditions Unified School Festival. I'm Shidou Maki, filling the role of committee chairman.  
**Suzuka:** I, Konohana Suzuka, am assistant executive committee chairman. Everyone, let's work together to create a wonderful festival.  
**Students:** Yes\!  
**Kiyoka:** (What do I do... I wasn't thinking, so I thought "Joining the school festival's executive committee sounds exciting\!\", but now...)  
**Kiyoka:** (This feels like it could be a much more serious job...)  
**Maki:** To begin with, we need to settle on which activities the school festival will be performing. Does anyone have any ideas they'd like to propose?  
**Students:** ......  
**Maki:** Nobody...?  
**Suzuka:** It takes courage to be the first to state your opinion. Perhaps we should begin by offering our own proposals?  
**Maki:** Good point. Then, I'll start with my idea. With toji from every school gathered here, why don't we hold a tournament that decides the strongest of them all?  
**Yume:** Ooh, let's do that, let's do that\! It sounds fun\!  
**Maki:** Right?  
**Female Student A:** *whispering* Wait, but then it sounds like non-toji students don't get to do anything...  
**Suzuka:** Maki-san, Yume. That would be no different from the official yearly tournament.  
**Maki:** Er, you have a point...  
**Maki:** Coming up with an idea for the festival is harder than it seems. What do you think, Suzuka?  
**Suzuka:** Let's see... Since it is a festival after all, why not hold a formal dress party?  
**Suzuka:** Along with that, it would be nice to invite an orchestra to perform a classical concert for us.  
**Female Student B:** *whispering* What does a formal party have to do with a school festival...  
**Female Student C:** *whispering* A classical concert is gonna put people to sleep...  
**Yume:** That's way too serious, Suzuka onee-san\! It just sounds boring\!  
**Yume:** We should do a swordfighting tournament after all-\! Everyone from the Five Traditions is gonna be there anyway\~\!  
**Maki:** Hmmm... Yomi, why don't you tell us what you think?  
**Yomi:** In my case... I have no preference when it comes to the subject of the school festival.  
**Yomi:** But, I think it's necessary we consider in advance what kind of aradama countermeasures to prepare.  
**Maki:** ......  
**Suzuka:** What's wrong, Maki-san?  
**Maki:** ...Nothing, I just remembered a request that President Hashima and President Gojou asked of me.  
**Yume:** What'd those old ladies want?  
**Maki:** They said "When it comes to the Five Traditions unified school festival, be sure to keep it student appropriate and do something everyone attending can enjoy."  
**Suzuka:** Thinking on the "student appropriate" part, our suggestions have been somewhat off, haven't they.  
**Maki:** But what should we do...  
**Kiyoka:** Um...  
**Maki:** What is it? Musumi Kiyoka. If you have a proposal, speak up and share it.  
**Maki:** Y-Yes\!  
**Kiyoka:** Um... I'm not sure if my ideas will be any good, but...  
**Suzuka:** Don't be shy, tell everyone.  
**Kiyoka:** Uh... We could all wear cute matching dresses, and work at a maid cafe?  
**Female Student D:** Huh... Well that's better than a swordfighting tournament or a classical concert.  
**Kiyoka:** And then... We could get the girls who are good at singing and dancing together, and have a live show on stage\!  
**Female Student A:** That could work\! I've always wanted to be a part of a girl band\!  
**Kiyoka:** And also, all the students from all the schools could do a beauty pageant\!  
**Female Student B:** Sounds like fun\! My girl's better looking than most, you know.  
**Maki:** That's surprising... They were so quiet before, but now they're all joining in.  
**Kiyoka:** Ah... I'm sorry\! I'm talking too much, aren't I.  
**Suzuka:** Not at all. Your ideas seem to be quite popular.  
**Suzuka:** Everyone, what do you think about using her suggestions?  
**Students:** WE APPROVE-\!  
**Kiyoka:** (Thank goodness. I think I managed to help out.)  

## 2: Distribution of Roles
**Maki:** Okay, now we have a general idea of what activities we'll be doing during the festival. To continue, we should assign everyone's positions.  
**Maki:** Members of the executive committee will be responsible for different roles on the day of the school festival. If there's a position you want, you can go ahead and claim it...  
**Suzuka:** In that case, why not let Musumi-san, who came up with those great suggestions, choose the role she wants first.  
**Kiyoka:** N-No, I couldn't\! I'd be fine helping with any position\! The maid cafe, the beauty pageant, or the live stage, I'll do my best to help wherever you need me to\!  
**Yomi:** Musumi-san, are you sure about that?  
**Kiyoka:** Yes. There's so many things I want to do that it's hard to pick just one... I know\! To keep things fair, why don't we use a lottery to decide?  
**Maki:** Understood. If that's how you want it, we'll do it.  
After drawing the lottery--

  
**Kiyoka:** Aww...  
**Kiyoka:** (I said I'd do my best at anything, but I didn't think I'd draw the most boring one...)  
**Kiyoka:** (Security duty patrolling the neighborhood. Which means, I have to be standing around far away from the actual festival...)  
**Maki:** How did it come to this... Why am I assigned to the maid cafe?  
**Suzuka:** What are the chances, that's my position too. And Yume and Yomi's as well.  
**Yume:** There's gonna be lots of guests coming to the maid cafe, right? Since they're all coming from the Five Traditions, that means there could be strong girls in there too\! I wanna fight them already\!  
**Suzuka:** Yume... A maid cafe is no place to be starting fights.  
**Maki:** ...  
**Yomi:** ......  
**Yume:** What's with you two?  
**Maki:** Does this mean I'll have to be serving guests in a maid uniform...?  
**Yomi:** It's nothing... The lottery's outcome has me slightly shocked...  
**Kiyoka:** I know what you mean. It was a bit of a shock for me too, being on the security team...  
**Yomi:** ...Musumi-san, I have a proposal. You could trade duties with me.  
**Kiyoka:** Eh, you don't have to go that far\!  
**Maki:** I see, I hadn't considered that... If I could be on the security team instead, then I'd rather...  
**Suzuka:** Maki-san, Yomi. You can't always go around expecting to only do security work.  
**Maki:** I know, but... I can't be a maid...  
**Yomi:** I'd be better suited patrolling the area than serving guests...  
**Yume:** Ehh, then I want to be doing that too\!  
**Suzuka:** Hold it right there\! We of the elite guard have been entrusted to supervise and manage this entire school festival.  
**Suzuka:** So don't you think it would be wrong to have three of us patrolling outside the school grounds?  
**Yomi:** ...When you say it that way, it's difficult not to agree...  
**Suzuka:** Unless something urgent happens, the elite guard should remain inside the school grounds.  
**Maki:** It's like you said... Yomi, I think we should try to do the duties the lottery gave us, but what do you think?  
**Yomi:** ...I understand. Whatever task I'm given, I will do everything in my power to carry out.  
**Kiyoka:** (...It's disappointing, but I'll try to do my best on patrol too...)  

## 3: Grand Opening\! The Five Traditions Unified School Festival
On the day of the Five Traditions Unified School Festival--

  
**Maki:** There's more guests than I expected. I knew the executive committee would be busy, but can they handle this...?  
**Suzuka:** Everyone's putting in a good effort. You too, Maki-san. When you have the time, feel free to take a break. You must be tired; you were running around all morning.  
**Maki:** This much is nothing for me... Or I'd like to say that, but this is too different from the duties I'm used to. I don't want to make any mistakes, so I'll rest while I can.  
**Yume:** Hey, hey, aren't you onee-sans gonna be maids too?  
**Maki:** It isn't our shift yet.  
**Maki:** Though, Yume. Aren't you supposed to be serving at the cafe right now? Want to explain why you're out here still in your usual uniform?  
**Yume:** Boo. It's no fun there if you and Suzuka onee-san aren't gonna come\!  
**Maki:** Still, we decided that it was your duty to be there right now. You have to stick to the schedule. Go on, hurry up back to the cafe.  
**Yume:** Fiiine.  
**Maki:** Alright, next they need me as an announcer on stage. Starting in three minutes. If I hurry, I can make it in time.  
At that time, outside the school festival grounds--

  
**Kiyoka:** Sigh... I know security is important and all... But am I really going to miss the whole festival standing out here...  
**Kiyoka:** The band should be playing up on stage right about now. That must be so exciting...  
**Mihono:** Huh? Kiyoka?  
**Chie:** What are you doing out here?  
**Kiyoka:** Hono-chan\! And you too, Setouchi-san. Why are you here?  
**Chie:** The crepe stand we're managing ran out of ingredients, so we had to run out and buy more.  
**Mihono:** You should come check it out later, Kiyoka. Chii-nee makes some super yummy crepes\!  
**Kiyoka:** I wish I could go, but... I'm busy with my duties.  
**Chie:** That's right, you're on the executive committee, aren't you? You must have a lot of responsibilities.  
**Kiyoka:** Yes, it's my job today to patrol the perimeter of the school festival.  
**Mihono:** Oh, really? Sorry, we had no idea and came up and bothered you...  
**Kiyoka:** No, don't worry about it\!  
**Kiyoka:** But Hono-chan, you should get going. Everyone's waiting for you to bring back those ingredients, right?  
**Mihono:** Yeah... Then, I'll see you later, Kiyoka.  
**Kiyoka:** Have a good time.  
**Kiyoka:** Sigh... Now I'm alone again.  
**Kiyoka:** That crepe stand sounds like fun... The maid cafe must be busy too...  
**Kiyoka:** Huh? Someone's calling.  
**Kiyoka:** It's from Shidou-san\! Why would she call me...  
**Kiyoka:** Hello, this is executive committee member Musumi Kiyoka, on patrol. What do you need from me?  
**Maki:** An emergency came up. Musumi Kiyoka, return to the school as fast as possible.  
**Kiyoka:** Eh-, what happened...?  
**Maki:** I'll explain the details after you arrive. Come quickly.  
**Kiyoka:** She hung up... What sort of emergency do they need me for?  
**Kiyoka:** Ah... Does that mean aradama appeared in the festival\!\?  
**Kiyoka:** I have to get back there\!  
**Kiyoka:** Pant... Pant... Musumi Kiyoka, is here.  
**Maki:** Good, you're here already. Something unexpected came up.  
**Kiyoka:** Yes, please tell me what happened\!  
**Maki:** Right, actually... The maid cafe is a runaway success, and we're severely understaffed there...  
**Kiyoka:** Eh...?  

## 4: The School Festival I Dreamt Of
**Kiyoka:** The maid cafe... Is understaffed? Then, why did you call me here...?  
**Maki:** I'm sorry to ask this suddenly, but I want you to change positions to serving at the maid cafe.  
**Kiyoka:** Y-You want me to be a maid?  
**Suzuka:** Yes. We've decided to reassign 10% of the security team to the maid cafe. And you're one of them.  
**Maki:** Your uniform has already been prepared for you. Once you're ready, begin standing in the hall and helping guests.  
**Kiyoka:** Um... But then, will there be enough people helping security?  
**Yomi:** You shouldn't be concerned with that. In place of the ones reassigned, I will become part of the security team.  
**Kiyoka:** Just by yourself, Satsuki-san...?  
**Yomi:** Extensive search and lookout assignments are my specialty.  
**Yomi:** If that's all, I'll go to my post.  
**Kiyoka:** Ah... Satsuki-san, she left...  
**Kiyoka:** Is it really okay, letting Satsuki-san handle that much by herself?  
**Suzuka:** Of course. Interacting with the guests was leaving Yomi fairly worn out.  
**Suzuka:** We decided it would be a better use of their talents putting people in roles they're more accustomed to.  
**Maki:** Musumi Kiyoka. I'd like for you to start working in your new position straight away.  
**Kiyoka:** Ah... Understood\! Of course I will\!  
**Kiyoka:** (I can't believe I get to serve guests at the maid cafe\! I'm so glad I tried the executive committee\!)  
**Passing Guest:** Excuse me, I want to go to the maid cafe. Can you tell me which way it is?  
**Kiyoka:** In that case, I'll guide you there, master\!  
**Suzuka:** Musumi-san immediately understands how to win a guest's heart. Having them switch positions was the right idea after all.  
**Maki:** Agreed. Everyone has something they're better cut out for.  
And like that, the school festival finished without incident--

  
**Maki:** So it's already time to shut it down. I'm glad everything went smoothly.  
**Yomi:** Because of my reassignment, I was also able to fulfill my duties until the end. Thank you very much.  
**Suzuka:** We received nothing but praise from both our guests and the presidents. Job well done, everyone.  
**Kiyoka:** It's a little sad, saying goodbye already...  
**Yume:** You looked like you were having a lot of fun being a maid, Onee-san\!  
**Maki:** That's for sure. Even I was hearing about the reputation you built up among the guests.  
**Maki:** From helping with the preparations, to working security, to even serving guests, having you around was a huge relief. Thanks.  
**Kiyoka:** You don't have to go that far... I just wanted to have a good time with everyone...  
**Suzuka:** Everything turned out so well in part thanks to those feelings. I'd like to thank you as well, Musumi-san.  
**Yume:** Yeah, you helped me out a lot too\! Thanks, Onee-san\!  
**Kiyoka:** Hearing that from all of you... Makes me glad.  
**Kiyoka:** (I was nervous at first... But I'm glad I tried this...)
