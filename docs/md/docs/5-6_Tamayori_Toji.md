## 1: The Investigation Team Without Mihono (1)
Several days later--

  
**Aradama:** BAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\!  
**Mirja:** Arrived at the scene\! Engaging suppression of aradama\! Asakura Mihono\!  
**Mihono:** Here\!  
**Mirja:** I know you're still not accustomed to this, but please act as our operator\!  
**Mihono:** You can leave it to me, Mirja-san\!  
**Kiyoka:** You'll see, Hono-chan. We'll do all we can so you won't have to worry about us.  
**Mihono:** ...Yeah, do your best, Kiyoka.  
**Kofuki:** I like it better with you gone, Mihocchi. I get way more aradama to play with this way\!  
**Mihono:** Isn't that kinda rude, Fukki...?  
**Yui:** Ahaha.  
**Chie:** Alright, that's enough.  
**Chie:** Everyone, let's stay focused on what we have to do\!  

## 2: The Investigation Team Without Mihono (2)
**Mirja:** Kh, these are difficult opponents...  
**Kofuki:** What's wrong with that\! That just makes 'em more fun to fool around with\!  
**Chie:** Kiyoka-chan\! Yui-chan\! Please back me up\!  
**Kiyoka/Yui:** Okay\!  
**Mihono:** Guys...  
**Tsugumi:** They're having a bit of trouble today.  
**Mihono:** ...  
**Tsugumi:** ...The investigation team should be able to handle themselves though.  
**Tsugumi:** Would you like some hot milk? It would help you to relax.  
**Mihono:** ...Ah, sure.  
**Tsugumi:** I'll get it ready.  
**Mihono:** ............  
**Mihono:** So being an operator was this nerve-wracking... I never knew.  
**Tsugumi:** Did you find it much easier when you were part of the fighting yourself...?  
**Mihono:** Hmmm... I don't know if I'd call either way easier... I guess? Being in the fight is hard in its own way...  
**Mihono:** But... it's like, just waiting here is a different kind of hard from when I was fighting...  
**Mihono:** It's frustrating, not being able to do anything...  
**Tsugumi:** ...You're better suited to be a toji, aren't you.  
**Mihono:** Huh?  
**Tsugumi:** Here you go, Asakura-san.  
**Mihono:** ...Thanks a bunch.  
**Mihono:** ......Itsh hot\!  
**Tsugumi:** Please take your time with it.  
**Mihono:** Yeh... [blow- blow-]  
**Yui:** Augh\!\?  
**Mihono:** Ah--\!\?  
**Mihono:** Yui\!\? What happened; are you alright\!\?  
**Yui:** I'm fine, Mihono-chan. I just took a little hit from an aradama is all\!  
**Mihono:** ...Be careful, okay?  
**Yui:** Sure\!  
**Mihono:** (Everybody's working so hard... and I'm the only one not doing anything.)  
**Mihono:** (If I were there, I could fight with Kiyoka and Yui, and back up Fukki, and then Chii-nee and Mirja-san...\!)  
**Mihono:** Ughh\!\?  
**Tsugumi:** Asakura-san\!\?  
**Tsugumi:** Please try to calm down\! If you lose control here...\!  
**Mihono:** It's okay... I don't want to get locked up either... This, isn't that bad...  
**Mihono:** [pant... pant...]  
**Tsugumi:** Asakura-san. Do you want to leave your seat? If you're at risk of rampaging even while acting as an operator...  
**Mihono:** ...It's fine. No matter where I am, this'll probably be the same.  
**Tsugumi:** ...Is that so.  
**Tsugumi:** Let's send an aid request for the investigation team, just to be safe. Please help me with this, Asakura-san.  
**Mihono:** ...Okay.  
**Mihono:** (Just thinking about how I wanted to fight with everybody was enough to almost make me lose it...)  
**Mihono:** (What's... going to happen with me? Can I really keep this up...?)  

## 3: Tamayori Toji (1)
**Akira:** Huh? The investigation team put out an aid request?  
**Akira:** With how tough they are, those aradama shouldn't be giving them a hard time.  
**Yuuki:** What should we do?  
**Akira:** No point in asking\! Let's get ready to go\!  
**Akira:** We're gonna show off for Mihono\!  
**Yuuki:** Alright\!  
**Akira:** This'll be the first time we put these in action\! Get it in gear\! We're gonna kick some ass\!  
**Tsugumi:** We've put an aid request through to the Sword Administration Bureau. A nearby unit should be on its way.  
**Mirja:** Did you hear that\!\? Just hold out a little longer\!  
**Kofuki:** Huhh\!\? These're MY aradama-chan though\!\?  
**Chie:** We didn't expect there to be this many aradama, or that they'd be so strong. Now's not the time to go pushing ourselves, alright?  
**Kiyoka:** She's right, Kofuki-san.  
**Kofuki:** Then before they get here, I'm gonna have my fill of the fun\!  
**???:** Nah, we're taking over the show from here\!  
**???:** You guys get outta the way\!  
**Kofuki:** ......Huh? What's their deal?  
**Mirja:** That armor looking... Though, it's different from storm armor...  
**Yui:** More importantly, isn't that...  
**Mihono:** Did something happen\!\?  
**???:** That voice... That you, Mihono?  
**Mihono:** ...Are you there, Akira-san?  
**Akira:** Huh, so you weren't here yourself. ...Guess that's why they're struggling with these aradama.  
**Akira:** Mihono. Are you seriously gonna be okay sticking with them?  
**Mihono:** ......  
**Mirja:** Inago Akira\! Looking like that; you couldn't have...  
**Akira:** Yeah. This's tamayori. Cool as hell, right?  
**Mihono:** ...Eh? Why did... you become a tamayori toji... Akira-san...?  
**Yuuki:** I became a tamayori toji too, Mihono-san.  
**Mihono:** Yuuki too\!\?  
**Mihono:** Did Hitakami-san force you to be test subjects instead of me\!\?  
**Akira:** Don't think so low of us\!  
**Mihono:** --\!\?  
**Akira:** This's just what we wanted to happen.  
**Akira:** And you're asking if we got forced into it because of you?  
**Akira:** You think this is a joke or something, Mihono?  
**Mihono:** ......  
**Akira:** Me and Yuuki are gonna show you the kind of power you passed up\!  
**Akira:** Yuuki, we're taking out all the aradama around here\!  

## 4: Tamayori Toji (2)
**Akira:** ORAAAAAAAAAGHH\!  
**Akira:** Now that's more like it\! The way this was going, it's nowhere near enough\!  
**Akira:** Come on, come on\! Show me what you've gooooooooooooot\!\!  
**Kiyoka:** She beat that many aradama in the blink of an eye...  
**Akira:** Heh, nothing to it. Yuuki\! I'm leaving those ones to you\!  
**Yuuki:** ......  
**Mirja:** What's wrong\!\? If you're having any trouble, we can assist...  
**Yuuki:** I won't need it\!  
**Mirja:** --\!\?  
**Akira:** Oi, oi, Yuuki\! You're makin' the crowd worried cause you're spacing out\!  
**Yuuki:** I wasn't spacing out\!  
**Yuuki:** It's a hassle fighting them one by one, so I was only waiting for them to bunch up\!  
**Yuuki:** From here... please pay close attention\!  
**Yuuki:** HAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH\!\!  
**Yui:** Crazy...  
**Yui:** With that, it's like they don't even need us here... Ah.  
**Chie:** Is this what Makoto was after...?  
**Akira:** You got it wrong. It's not just Makocchan. This's the strength we were all after.  
**Mirja:** Thank you for your reinforcements. However... This doesn't excuse the incident the other day.  
**Akira:** ...You're right.  
**Akira:** I'm sorry about that, Mihono. I promise we won't do something like that again.  
**Mirja:** Do you expect us to believe that?  
**Akira:** All we can say is to trust us. Like you can tell, we managed to make do without Mihono.  
**Mihono:** ...It might've failed, right? Why would you do something so...  
**Akira:** Cause we figured we'd need it. And what are you doing?  
**Mihono:** We're...  
**Yuuki:** Mihono-san\! Please work together with us\! It's for your sake too\!  
**Kiyoka:** Hono-chan isn't going to help you with your ridiculous experiments\!  
**Yuuki:** ...You called it ridiculous?  
**Yuuki:** As you can see, the tamayori experiments were a success. What we'd like Mihono-san's help with is curing the toji who were used as test subjects.  
**Yuuki:** But the people who became test subjects... They gave their resolve to do it.  
**Yuuki:** I won't let you call that ridiclous.  
**Kiyoka:** Uh...  
**Akira:** ...They went and pulled you away from the fighting. Probably cause they don't want to deal with you.  
**Chie:** It's not like that\!  
**Akira:** Talk is cheap, y'know.  
**Akira:** ...Mihono, come with us. We need you.  
**Mihono:** .........  
**Mihono:** I'm sorry. I made up my mind to face Kanayamahime with everybody on the investigation team.  
**Akira:** ...Is that really what you're thinking?  
**Mihono:** Eh?  
**Akira:** Aren't you just running away? The way things are, you're not even beginning to solve anything.  
**Akira:** So what... Are you looking to turn into Kanayamahime?  
**Mihono:** --\!  
**Chie:** That's not going to happen\! Whatever it takes, we're going to save her\!  
**Akira:** No you won't. The only ones who can do that... That'd be us.  

## 5: Bit by Bit (1)
**Announcer:** Next on the news: tamayori toji. There hasn't been a day we haven't been talking about this lately, has there?  
**Man:** It lets the toji defeat aradama safely, doesn't it? I don't see why they shouldn't use it more often.  
**Woman:** There's only been more aradama after the Great Year-End Disaster, so it'd be a waste not to.  
**Expert:** Still, tamayori toji are using aradama, aren't they? Isn't that dangerous?  
**Makoto:** That issue has already been resolved. It has practically no effect on the toji themselves.  
**Expert:** Maybe, but doesn't it feel wrong, having to wear that on their body? Is there even a point to that?  
**Makoto:** There is.  
**Makoto:** By equipping noro onto themselves, a tamayori toji is able to render attacks from aradama on the same level as that noro ineffective.  
**Makoto:** With this, it's possible to dramatically reduce the risk of injuries among toji.  
**Expert:** I-Is that right?  
**Makoto:** It is.  
**Makoto:** And, of course, it provides not only defense, but also enhances their attacks.  
**Makoto:** Okatana and noro. A toji making use of both can prove exceptionally effective against aradama.  
**Announcer:** That's amazing.  
**Expert:** But, even so...  
**Makoto:** The perception of noro as something dangerous is an outdated belief.  
**Makoto:** We have already successfully fused aradama with toji. I firmly believe tamayori toji will be the model of the future of toji, able to keep everyone safe.  
**Announcer:** Well then, why don't we move to a demonstration of how incredible tamayori toji are in practice.  
**Chie:** ......  
**Mirja:** Tamayori toji are yet again the focus on television today.  
**Ellen:** Apparently grandpa offered to be on this debate they're showing. But Makomako turned him down.  
**Kaoru:** This whole thing reeks. They say over and over it's safe, but weren't there people the experiments screwed up on?  
**Mirja:** Yes, we saw it with our own eyes.  
**Chie:** ......  
**Mirja:** Setouchi Chie?  
**Chie:** Ah, I'm sorry, I wasn't listening. What were we talking about?  
**Ellen:** Are you doing alright, Chie?  
**Chie:** ...I'm fine.  
**Kaoru:** As if. You're totally distracted.  
**Kaoru:** For real... I wonder what Akira's up to right about now.  

## 6: Bit by Bit (2)
**Akira:** Yo.  
**Hitakami Toji:** You've been hard at work, Inago-san. Are you done with your missions for today?  
**Akira:** I had a little free time. So I came to check in.  
**Akira:** ...Has anything changed?  
**Hitakami Toji:** No, I haven't seen any changes.  
**Akira:** It might take cutting through utsushi to stop tamayori, but I hate to leave you with this awful job.  
**Hitakami Toji:** It doesn't bother me. I have faith that Makoto-sama will be able to cure them.  
**Akira:** Same here.  
**Akira:** ...Whoa.  
**Hitakami Toji:** Are you having vertigo? Your face is looking pale...  
**Akira:** You can tell? I've been feeling kinda worn out lately.  
**Hitakami Toji:** Please try not to push yourself too hard. You and Toribane-san are irreplaceable to us in the Hitakami faction.  
**Akira:** Thanks.  
**Akira:** But, whether or not the world's gonna accept tamayori toji, right now's when it counts most.  
**Akira:** I can't go complaining I'm tired or anything. Gotta go out to as many places as I can and show as many toji as possible how strong tamayori toji can be.  
**Akira:** This'll all lead back into the future of toji.  
**Hitakami Toji:** Right\!  
**Akira:** (Though... This tiredness is seriously no joke. What if this's one the side effects of being a tamayori toji...?)  
**Akira:** ............\!  
**Akira:** (Don't go getting cold feet, Inago Akira\! You know you haven't got the compatibility Mihono does\! No shit something'd happen\! This isn't anything you weren't prepared for\!)  
**Akira:** (Just a little more... Just hold out a little longer\! Makocchan's on TV, doing what she can.)  
**Akira:** (And cause of that, we've got offers lining up from people wanting to sponsor us\!)  
**Akira:** (But that's all based on us being success cases\! So long as Yuuki and me show results, it should go fine\!)  
**Tamayori Toji:** Ugh, urgh...  
**Akira:** --\!  
**Hitakami Toji:** If I remove her utsushi, she'll calm down. Please stand back, Inago-san.  
**Akira:** ...Nah, I'll help out.  
**Hitakami Toji:** But...  
**Akira:** Just let me do this.  
**Tamayori Toji:** Ina... san... I'm so...rry...  
**Akira:** You still conscious?  
**Tamayori Toji:** Ye...s... Sorry for...  
**Akira:** ...There's nothing you've got to apologize for. We're gonna do whatever it takes to save you, so just rest for now.  
**Tamayori Toji:** ......  
**Akira:** ...Just sleep it off a little longer. I know it won't be long.  
**Hitakami Toji:** Thank you very much, Inago-san.  
**Akira:** Look after them for me.  
**Hitakami Toji:** Right\!  
**Makoto:** Akira-chan.  
**Akira:** Huh? What's up, Makocchan.  
**Makoto:** It's about Yuuki-chan...  
**Akira:** --\!\? Did something happen with Yuuki\!\?  
**Makoto:** She's caught a cold.  
**Akira:** ...Huh?  
**Yuuki:** [cough cough]... I was careless and let myself get sick...  
**Yuuki:** I was thinking I had somehow been feeling tired lately...  
**Makoto:** There's no need for you to worry over it, Yuuki-chan. Please just have a nice long rest.  
**Makoto:** Once you're better, I'll be depending on you again.  
**Yuuki:** ...Okay.  
**Akira:** ......  
**Akira:** The hell, Yuuki. If you're catching colds, you must've not been training enough. You better be ready when you get better, alright?  
**Yuuki:** ...Sure\!  
**Akira:** So, rest up now. As far as your missions go... I'll handle 'em.  
**Akira:** I'm counting on you to help Yuuki bounce back, Makocchan.  
**Makoto:** Of course; just leave her to me.  

## 7: Yomi and Akira
**Yomi:** ......  
**Suzuka:** Yomi-san? You look troubled; is something the matter?  
**Yomi:** ...No, it's nothing.  
**Suzuka:** Are you sure?  
**Yomi:** Yes.  
**Yomi:** It's a personal matter, so I'll resolve it myself.  
**Hitakami Toji A:** There's an intruder\!  
**Yomi:** ...  
**Hitakami Toji B:** You're... Satsuki Yomi\! Why are you trespassing here\!\!  
**Yomi:** ...I've only come to meet with a friend.  
**Hitakami Toji B:** A friend\!\?  
**Yomi:** Please let me see Inago Akira.  
**Akira:** I was wondering what was going on; it's you, huh.  
**Yomi:** Akira.  
**Akira:** It's been a while. So, you came to see me?  
**Yomi:** That's right.  
**Akira:** ...Then, let's head out for a bit. Right now... I don't want to go making things too noisy here.  
**Yomi:** ...Alright then.  
**Akira:** We've walked pretty far. So, what'd you want?  
**Yomi:** The side effects of tamayori... You've noticed them, haven't you?  
**Akira:** ...  
**Yomi:** That's the underlying cause of Toribane-san's cold as well.  
**Akira:** I'm the one who should be asking how you noticed. What'd you do?  
**Yomi:** I have eyes always watching around you. I've noticed several times your and Toribane-san's eyes turning red.  
**Akira:** Tch, well shit.  
**Akira:** So you've seen this then.  
**Yomi:** Please stop using aradama for combat.  
**Akira:** You're one to talk.  
**Yomi:** No one besides me... should have to use this power. Please suspend all research into tamayori toji.  
**Akira:** I made up my mind to deal with this. Besides, the effects aren't as bad as putting noro right in your body like myouga.  
**Yomi:** But it is having an effect. Are you still going to hold to those words?  
**Akira:** Course I am. Our leader's the one saying it's safe.  
**Yomi:** Akira...  
**Akira:** As buddies, I appreciate you worrying about me. Thanks.  
**Akira:** But, that's not happening. This isn't enough to make me roll over and give you an "Oh, is that right?"  
**Yomi:** ...Does Hitakami-san know about this?  
**Akira:** ...Don't you dare tell Makocchan. Don't think I won't hold a grudge just cause you're you.  
**Yomi:** ...So she doesn't know.  
**Yomi:** Was the reason you brought me out here also so this conversation wouldn't reach Hitakami-san's ears?  
**Akira:** ...  
**Akira:** Since you came all the way to see me, and cause we go way back, I'll say this much.  
**Akira:** Stay out of our business. I'm not showing mercy to anyone who doesn't; not even you.  
**Yomi:** ......  
**Akira:** I'm glad we got a chance to talk again. Seeya.  
**Yomi:** ......Akira. I...  

## 8: A Rolling Stone (1)
**Announcer:** Tamayori toji are making another strong showing today\! For today's commentary, we have...  
**Richard Friedman:** Heeey, could I get a hand carrying these documents in?  
**Ellen:** Yes, Grandpa\! Come help too, Kaoru\!  
**Kaoru:** Do I have to... What do you want me to carry?  
**Friedman:** Thanks, the both of you. Here, you can take this.  
**Kaoru:** ...So heavy\! What's with the amount of papers in here\!\?  
**Ellen:** These are... Documents on myouga toji?  
**Tsugumi:** Yes. We prepared them for an investigation of tamayori toji.  
**Kaoru:** Is that what you were up to?  
**Friedman:** This is what I had originally put together for my interview with Hitakami Makoto-kun.  
**Friedman:** Though she turned me down.  
**Yui:** M-Make way please-\! I've got some more documents-\!  
**Kaoru:** Whoa\!\? There's still more\!\?  
**Chie:** This is all data on tamayori toji. Some of it is what Makoto published, but some of it was gathered independently.  
**Ellen:** Independently...?  
**Mirja:** It seems to be data that Origami Yukari-sama had independently collected.  
**Kiyoka:** Ooph... I wonder if that's all of them?  
**Friedman:** Thanks, you were a big help.  
**Friedman:** Now then. I'm sure you're all curious to find out the results of our investigation.  
**Mihono:** ......  
**Friedman:** First off, Hitakami Makoto-kun didn't lie to us. Its capabilities against aradama are greater than myouga toji, and the effects on the body aren't as drastic.  
**Mihono:** So basically... that means tamayori toji are safe?  
**Friedman:** It's a little too soon to come to that conclusion.  
**Friedman:** This is only talking about the capabilities, but the problem is, what kind of effects does it have on the body?  
**Friedman:** And about that... She phrased it very deliberately. It has "practically" no effects on a toji.  
**Tsugumi:** Not all that much time has passed since they began using tamayori toji, but side-effects seem to already be showing.  
**Mihono:** Huh\!\?  
**Tsugumi:** So far, it's confirmed to have had an effect on their physical condition.  
**Friedman:** It doesn't look to have any effects on the mind like with myouga toji, but it's started having an influence elsewhere.  
**Friedman:** Though the impact only seems minor so far.  
**Yui:** So basically... we don't have to worry too much for now?  
**Friedman:** No, it's not as simple as that.  
**Friedman:** To give an example... How about this. Think of tamayori toji like catching a cold.  
**Friedman:** Inago-kun and Toribane-kun are only showing a fever. But... the toji who experienced it before them are showing signs of pneumonia and other worse conditions.  
**Friedman:** And there's no guarantee Inago-kun and Toribane-kun's cases won't escalate to that point.  
**Mirja:** Then you're saying, if for whatever reason, they're unable to regulate their noro, they might become like the tamayori toji test subject we saw before?  
**Friedman:** That's how it is.  
**Friedman:** And, whatever it could take to cause that, it could be happening at this very moment for all we know.  
**Friedman:** ...This technology wasn't ready to be implemented yet. That's what I believe.  
**Chie:** ......  

## 9: A Rolling Stone (2)
**Chie:** Ellen-san\!  
**Ellen:** Chie? What's wrong?  
**Chie:** There's something I wanted to discuss with you.  
**Chie:** ......I want to talk with Makoto. Please, help me out, Ellen-san\!  
**Ellen:** I don't mind helping, but, why did you come to me?  
**Chie:** Right now... I don't want Mihono-chan coming near Makoto. I can't make the investigation team act on this.  
**Ellen:** ......  
**Ellen:** Alright then\! Let's come up with a plan to go see Makoto\!  
**Akane:** You want to meet and speak with Hitakami Makoto-san...?  
**Ellen:** Yes\! And, we were planning on bringing Grandpa, to discuss tamayori toji with her, with Chie and myself as his guards.  
**Chie:** Please let us go. I want to talk with Makoto... at least once.  
**Akane:** ...Very well then.  
**Chie:** Thank you very much\!  
**Akane:** However, I'll be adding one more member. Suzuka-san from the Special Defense Team will be accompanying you.  
**Ellen:** It'll be reassuring having Hanahana along\!  
**Akane:** We can work out the details here, if you would.  
...Several days later.

  
**Kiyoka:** It's been a while since we had a day off, hasn't it\!  
**Mihono:** They sorta gave us a break all of a sudden, but... is it really okay for us to not be doing anything?  
**Yui:** It's fine, it's fine\! Things have been really rough lately, so we've gotta find time to relax too\!  
**???:** Are you Asakura Mihono?  
**Mihono:** That's me...?  
**Kiyoka:** ...Who are you?  
**???:** I'll need you to come quietly with us.  
**Kiyoka:** Yui-chan...  
**Yui:** Yeah... Mihono-chan, you stand back\!  

## 10: Back to Tohoku (1)
**???:** Kh...  
**Kiyoka:** Attacking us out of nowhere like that... What are you after?  
**Yui:** I'll take a pretty lady coming after me any day, so it's too bad that's not what you're here for.  
**Mihono:** Did Hitakami-san order you to do this...?  
**Yui:** Boss said they wouldn't be coming after Mihono-chan anymore though?  
**???:** ...There's still a use for you.  
**Kiyoka:** A use for her... Is that all Hono-chan is to you\!\?  
**Yui:** ...Take it easy, Kiyoka-chan. For starters, what do you mean, there's a use for her?  
**Yui:** Does that mean Mihono-chan's going to keep being targeted in the future?  
**???:** To get Kanayamahime... we're willing to do anything it takes.  
**???:** While we're talking, my partners should have taken Richard Friedman and his guards captive.  
**Mihono:** Friedman-san and his guards...?  
**Kiyoka:** Yui-chan... Does she mean...?  
**Yui:** ...Yeah.  
**Mihono:** Kiyoka? Yui? Do you two know something about this...?  
**???:** It looks like they kept it secret from you.  
**Kiyoka:** ...Today, Friedman-san, Chie-san, Ellen-san, and Konohana-san were going to talk with Hitakami Makoto-san...  
**Mihono:** But, nobody told me about that\!  
**Yui:** Just calm down, Mihono-chan.  
**Yui:** Chie-san talked to us about it. She didn't want to make you worried, so we shouldn't let you know.  
**Yui:** Since they succeeded with tamayori toji, they were only going there to talk, so it should be fine...  
**???:** Fufu...  
**Mihono:** --\! I-I'm going to try calling Chii-nee\!  
**Mihono:** ............  
**Mihono:** It's no good; she's not picking up\!  

## 11: Back to Tohoku (2)
**Mihono:** ............  
**Mihono:** It's no good; she's not picking up\!  
**???:** It's pointless.  
**Mihono:** I'm going to call Mirja-san.  
**Mirja:** This is Kitora Mirja.  
**Mihono:** Mirja-san, are you there\!\? It's Chii-nee, they got Chii-nee\!  
**Mirja:** ...What do you mean? Calm down and explain everything to me, Asakura Mihono.  
**Mihono:** Uhh, we got attacked by somebody who seems to be working for Hitakami-san, and they said they took Chii-nee captive\!  
**Mirja:** The Hitakami faction is attacking you...?  
**Mirja:** I understand; I'll try contacting Setouchi Chie from here as well...  
**Mirja:** ............  
**Mirja:** You're right; I can't reach her.  
**Mihono:** What should we do\!\?  
**Mirja:** You need to calm down.  
**Mirja:** Including Setouchi Chie, the toji who went to speak with Hitakami Makoto are all highly capable. They wouldn't be taken captive by the Hitakami faction so easily.  
**Mirja:** Above all, it would be wise to consider that this could be a trap. First, we need to question this Hitakami toji who attacked you...  
**Mihono:** I don't care if it's a trap\!  
**Mihono:** The Hitakamis have tamayori toji... There's Akira-san and Yuuki there, right\!\?  
**Mihono:** If they had to protect Friedman-san, then even Chii-nee and them could've...  
**Mirja:** Before anything, we need to contact Setouchi Chie and the others. Even if we can't reach them by phone, there are other ways to...  
**Mihono:** What are you going to do if it's too late\!\?  
**Mirja:** ...Please calm down. The next time you lose control, you are going to lose your freedom.  
**Mihono:** I know that, but I can't help it\!\! If I don't go save Chii-nee right now... I know I'll regret it for the rest of my life\!\!  
**Mirja:** Asakura Mihono...  
**Mirja:** (...I need to avoid letting her become any more unstable. There's no way of knowing what could trigger her next rampage. Staying in contact with her through this remains the best option...)  
**Mirja:** Fine then. However, I cannot allow you to be sent there alone.  
**Mirja:** All members of the investigation team will go.  

## 12: Chie and Makoto (1)
**Ellen:** From what you told me, I had my guard up, but they let us through like it's no big deal.  
**Chie:** Y-You're not wrong... But, last time, they wouldn't even let us enter the grounds...  
**Suzuka:** This visit came with an official notice from Akane-sama. Even Hitakami Makoto wouldn't have outright refused us.  
**Friedman:** We'll have to give our thanks to Akane-sama then.  
**Makoto:** I'm sorry to keep you waiting.  
**Makoto:** It's a pleasure to meet you, Dr. Friedman.  
**Friedman:** Right, it's good to meet you. You did turn me down when we were going to debate on TV. So I was looking forward to today.  
**Makoto:** I had hoped to hear your advice in a more worthwhile environment, not something like that.  
**Makoto:** ...Would you lend us your knowledge, in order to treat the toji who assisted with the experiments?  
**Friedman:** I would be glad to.  
**Makoto:** Thank you very much.  
**Ellen:** ...Chie? Is Makoto really a bad guy? She sure doesn't seem like it... (whispered)  
**Chie:** I-I know... She isn't any different from the Makoto I remember... (whispered)  
**Makoto:** In that case, we'll lead you to the research facility.  
**Lab Worker:** Dr. Friedman, if you'd come with me.  
**Friedman:** Sure, lead the way.  
**Makoto:** ...  
**Friedman:** Oh? You won't be coming with us, Hitakami-kun?  
**Makoto:** No, I'm afraid I'd only get in the way of a more technical discussion.  
**Suzuka:** ...I'll be going along with Dr. Friedman.  
**Suzuka:** Setouchi-san, Kohagura-san, you should hear what you need to from Hitakami-san.  
**Chie:** ...Makoto.  
**Makoto:** It's been too long, Chie-san. I'm glad... to meet with you again.  
**Chie:** ...I'd rather something else brought us back together, if I could help it.  
**Makoto:** You mean what happened with Asakura Mihono-san, don't you.  
**Makoto:** I would like to apologize for the somewhat aggressive methods we took with her.  
**Makoto:** However, Chie-san. I don't believe we were entirely wrong.  
**Makoto:** If we consider Asakura-san's circumstances, it's a fact that she would be better situated here with us.  
**Chie:** You're not the one who gets to decide that.  
**Makoto:** If you only follow your emotions, you won't be there in time for her.  
**Chie:** Makoto\!  
**Ellen:** Please calm down, Chie.  
**Ellen:** Makoto, I think you've already realized, but we came here to ask you to stop using tamayori toji.  
**Makoto:** That would be the only reason for you to come meet with me now, wouldn't it.  
**Makoto:** However... I have no reason to follow your request.  
**Makoto:** The research into tamayori toji could not be going better. It's nearly every day we come across new data we never could have achieved before.  
**Makoto:** As of now, only a select few can make use of it... But, before long, I'm sure it will be possible for every toji to become tamayori toji.  
**Ellen:** And you'd sacrifice Akira and Yuuki for that?  
**Makoto:** ...What are you getting at?  
**Chie:** Inago-san and Toribane-san are having negative side-effects, aren't they?  
**Makoto:** ...I haven't received any reports about that.  
**Ellen:** But you're hearing about it now, aren't you?  
**Makoto:** ......  
**Makoto:** These are all things we've prepared for.  
**Chie:** Why go this far, Makoto? In the past, you wouldn't have...  
**Makoto:** Dirtied my hands with these experiments?  
**Makoto:** ...No matter when you're thinking of me, I haven't changed, Chie-san.  
**Chie:** Is this because of what happened back then? After that, you...  
**Makoto:** I won't deny that it's one of the causes.  
**Makoto:** I simply... don't want there to be any more toji like Miyako-san.  
**Makoto:** I don't anyone else to experience the things we have...  
**Chie:** ......  
**Chie:** I understand that feeling. But still, I'm against you using noro for that.  
**Makoto:** I wouldn't stop no matter who's against me.  
**Makoto:** When Inago and Toribane... became tamayori toji in my place, I resolved to that.  
**Ellen:** We're not going to be convincing her. She seemed very determined to me.  
**Chie:** Right...  
**Ellen:** I know about what happened to Miyako. You and Makoto were...  
**Chie:** We were in the same unit. Makoto and Miyako especially were paired up...  
**Ellen:** ...So that's why.  
**Chie:** Yes...  
**Ellen:** What do you think we should do, Chie?  
**Chie:** I understand what Makoto is thinking now. But, even still... I can't think tamayori toji are the right answer.  
**Ellen:** Neither can I.  
**Ellen:** I'd like it if aradama and humans could coexist, but this isn't what that should look like.  
**Ellen:** If it can't make everyone happier, there's no point to it\!  
**Chie:** Ellen-san...  
**Chie:** --\!\? Is that an alarm\!\?  

## 13: Chie and Makoto (2)
**Mihono:** Chii-nee\! Where are you\!\? Say something\! Chii-nee\!\!  
**Akira:** I was wondering what all the noise was about; it's you guys.  
**Mihono:** Akira-san\! Please give me back Chii-nee\!  
**Akira:** Give her back? What're you talking about, Mihono? They're free to leave whenever they're done with their inspection.  
**Mirja:** ...This morning, Asakura Mihono was attacked by one of your associates.  
**Akira:** Huh? What do you mean? I don't know a thing about that.  
**Yui:** ...Maybe you didn't know, Boss, but are you sure that Hitakami-san person didn't order them to?  
**Akira:** Makocchan wouldn't do something like that either\! Only ones who would are... So that's how it is.  
**Kofuki:** What's the deal then? Didn't Chichie get kidnapped?  
**Kiyoka:** I'm not sure, but... this all feels weird, doesn't it?  
**???:** Don't let Asakura Mihono get away\!  
**Akira:** ...Figures.  
**Akira:** What the hell are you going off starting on your own\!\?  
**???:** Asakura Mihono is the one who came to attack us.  
**Akira:** Cause you went and baited her, right? Or... Not you, but the group of heads backing you.  
**Hitakami Faction Head Group Toji:** ...We followed our own judgment. If you're going to get between us... We won't have a choice.  
**Hitakami Faction Head Group Toji:** You're up\! Bring down Inago-san with them if you have to\!  
**Tamayori Toji:** ...  
**Akira:** What're you in that for...  
**Tamayori Toji:** I was only able to become a proper tamayori toji like this thanks to you, Inago-san.  
**Akira:** "Proper"?  
**Akira:** Get the fuck out of here\! Nobody besides me and Yuuki can get the noro off of them\!  
**Tamayori Toji:** I'm prepared for whatever comes. Regardless, I believe this is what's necessary for the future of toji.  
**Akira:** You goddamn idiots\! Mihono\!  
**Mihono:** Y-Yeah\!\?  
**Akira:** I'm backing you up\!  
**Akira:** I'm gonna smash their faces in, till they never think of doing something this stupid again\!  

## 14: The Scheme's Consequence (1)
**Tamayori Toji:** HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\!  
**Mihono:** Kgh...\!  
**Kiyoka:** Hono-chan, stay behind me\!  
**Mihono:** O-Okay\!  
**Mirja:** ...A tamayori toji with their consciousness intact is that much more troublesome than the one we faced before.  
**Kofuki:** It's not like we can ignore the other ones either; what do we do, Mirja\!\?  
**Mirja:** Do not fight the tamayori toji head on\! Move to create an opening\!  
**Yui:** That's easy to say, but, like this...\!  
**Hitakami Faction Head Group Toji:** YAAAAAH\!  
**Yui:** Uwah\!\?  
**Akira:** Don't you touch Yui, asshole\!  
**Hitakami Faction Head Group Toji:** Urgh...  
**Akira:** You alright, Yui\!\?  
**Yui:** Th-Thanks a lot, Boss\!  
**Yui:** Or, wait, Boss\! Can't you become a tamayori toji too\!\? Wouldn't that make this way easier\!  
**Akira:** No can do\! I haven't got noro on me now\!  
**Mihono:** (Everybody's struggling... If I had some way to use Kanayamahime's power without going berserk...)  
**Mihono:** ...Rrgh\!\?  
**Kiyoka:** Hono-chan\!\?  
**Mihono:** But, ghh...  
**Akira:** Is she losing control\!\? You can't, Mihono\! You've gotta...\!  
**Mihono:** AAAAAAAARRRGGGHHHHHH\!\!  
**Chie:** Everyone\! ...Mihono-chan\!\?  
**Mihono:** ......  
**Chie:** No... Mihono-chan\! Hey, can you hear me\!\?  
**Ellen:** ...Chie.  
**Ellen:** ...We have to stop Mihomiho's from rampaging before we can do anything.  
**Ellen:** Kaoru told me all she had to do was cut through her utsushi...  
**Akira:** That's right...  
**Hitakami Faction Head Group Toji:** We did it\! We actually did it\! Now, we can...  
**Akira:** You think this is the time for that\!\?  
**Hitakami Faction Head Group Toji:** Ugh...  
**Makoto:** Akira-chan\!  
**Akira:** ...I'm sorry. I couldn't stop things from going to shit.  
**Makoto:** ...It's not your fault.  
**Chie:** Makoto\! Is this what you wanted\!\?  
**Makoto:** ...Right now, we need to take care of Asakura-san...  
**Chie:** I don't need you to tell me that...\! I'll be the one to bring Mihono-chan back\!  

## 15: The Scheme's Consequence (2)
**Chie:** Mihono-chan\! Please, just go back to normal...\!\!  
**Mihono:** Rrgh\!  
**Mihono:** ...  
**Chie:** ......  
**Hitakami Faction Head Group Toji:** Go now; capture Asakura Mihono\!  
**Makoto:** You mustn't let them have Asakura-san\!  
**Kofuki:** Like you have to say it\!  
**Mirja:** Setouchi Chie, take care of Asakura Mihono\! Musumi Kiyoka, Yamashiro Yui, protect Setouchi Chie\!  
**Chie:** I'm on it\! Cover us, you two\!  
**Kiyoka/Yui:** Right\!  
**Akira:** These are... Yomi's\!  
**???:** Everyone, this is your chance now\!  
**Mirja:** --\! Run towards the sound of that voice\!\!  
**Friedman:** It looks like we all made it out safe.  
**Ellen:** You're safe too, Grandpa\!  
**Friedman:** That's because, as soon as the alarm went off, she got in contact with us.  
**Yomi:** ...  
**Kofuki:** You were here too, Senpai?  
**Suzuka:** I had her come along, should worse come to worst.  
**Suzuka:** Though...  
**Mihono:** ...  
**Suzuka:** The Special Defense Team will be taking custody of Asakura-san. Is that clear?  
**Other:** A Request  
**Akane:** I'm sorry to call you here on such short notice.  
**Kanami:** That doesn't matter; is it true Mihono-chan went berserk\!\?  
**Akane:** ...It's the truth.  
**Hiyori:** Did Kanayamahime wake up?  
**Akane:** ...Not yet.  
**Kanami:** What made all this happen...  
**Akane:** The heads of the Hitakami faction acted out of control.  
**Hiyori:** Their faction's infighting now...\!\? Don't drag Mihono into something so stupid...\!  
**Akane:** ...  
**Akane:** Asakura-san will be placed in confinement at a Ministry of Defense facility. And, that's where... I have a request to make of you.  
**Kanami/Hiyori:** A request?
