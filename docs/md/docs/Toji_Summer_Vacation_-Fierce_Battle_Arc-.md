## 1: What Wakes in the Summer
**Yume:** Wow\~, it's the sea\~\! Hey, hey, Yomi onee-san\! Look, it's the sea, the sea\~\!  
**Yomi:** Yes, it's the sea. However, we're on alert right now.  
**Yume:** Come on\~, act a little more excited\~\. Yukari-sama\~, how long do we have to wait for\~\?  
**Yukari:** Only a little longer. Maki and Suzuka should be back from inspecting the site soon.  
**Yume:** But weren't all the aradama beaten yesterday? So there's no reason for us to be here, right? I keep hearing there's not enough people, so we didn't have to come all this way...  
**Yume:** Since they already took care of everything, we should just play on the beach. Can't we? Yukari-sama\~\.  
**Maki:** ...Yume, we don't have time to play around, you know?  
**Suzuka:** That's right. We're still here on a mission.  
**Yume:** Booo-, that's so boring\~\.  
**Yukari:** Maki, Suzuka, you're back. What did the Special Ritual Squad have to say?  
**Maki:** Yes. As you know, the aradama were suppressed, and their cleanup work was finished sometime yesterday.  
**Maki:** However, not long ago, a lecturer from Minoseki, Tanaka Taeko, sent in an interesting report--  
**Yukari:** ...I see. I wasn't aware this region had such a legend.  
**Suzuka:** Yes. After receiving this report, the Special Ritual Squad is currently continuing their investigation into the area.  
**Yukari:** Hm...  
**Suzuka:** Hello. This is the elite guard, Kohohana Suzuka speaking.  
**Suzuka:** ...Eh\!\? Are you sure\!\?  
**Maki:** What's wrong?  
**Suzuka:** Well... The people investigating the mountainside are reporting that another mass outbreak of aradama occurred.  
**Yukari:** Suzuka, tell them we'll be right there.  
**Suzuka:** By that you mean, you'll be coming too...\! Yes, I understand\!  
**Maki:** Yomi, Yume, are you prepared?  
**Yomi:** Yes. I can go at any time.  
**Yume:** Ehh\~, just when I thought I'd get to play on the beach\~\.  
**Maki:** Yume, you're still going on about that--  
**Yukari:** Leave her be, Maki. Yume, after this mission is over, you can play as much as you like.  
**Yume:** No way-\!\? Really\!\?  
**Yukari:** Yes, if that's what's needed to motivate you for this mission. You may be the elite guard, but that doesn't mean you're above having time off.  
**Yume:** Hooray-\! Then let's get alll\~ of these aradama beaten already\!  
**Yukari:** Maki, there should be three members of the Akabane swords investigation team in the area. Send them a directive. The more help the better.  
**Maki:** Yes, right away.  
**Yukari:** Then, let's move. We will now eradicate all the aradama appearing on the mountainside.  

## 2: Take Back Our Summer Vacation\!
**Mihono:** Nnn... I thought we'd finally get to have our summer vacation, but now we're back doing this again...  
**Kiyoka:** It's okay. We just have to beat all the aradama again.  
**Hiyori:** You sound confident. Very different from when I found you yesterday.  
**Kiyoka:** Yes. I realized something. It's only us toji who can protect the summer vacation everyone's looking forward to.  
**Kiyoka:** And also, I have all of you here with me now.  
**Mirja:** However, are you all sure about assisting us? You didn't receive any such order from President Maniwa this time, did you?  
**Ellen:** Even so, we want to help\! This ship's already sailed\!  
**Mai:** Mm. Let's not make this so impersonal.  
**Sayaka:** When we're done, we can all play together again.  
**Mihono:** Guys... Thank you so much\! Makes me feel all warm inside\!  
**Kaoru:** ...So, why're you here again?  
**Emily:** Uhh... Wh-What's the harm in it\!  
**Emily:** With this many of you toji around, you should have no trouble keeping me safe\!  
**Emily:** (Fu Fu Fu...\! To think, so many toji I've had my eyes on would gather in one place like this-- I'd never let this opportunity to gather data up close and personal escape me\!\)  
**Ellen:** Oh... That's quite the evil look in your eyes. What do you think, Kaoru? Should we bury her in the beach again?  
**Emily:** No-\! Never do that again\!  
**Mirja:** ...At any rate, why do you think these mass outbreaks of aradama are occurring around this mountain specifically?  
**Mihono:** I don't know, but if we can't figure out why, the same thing might keep happening again, won't it?  
**Sayaka:** Mai, do you know anything about this?  
**Mai:** I don't. My family does own a private beach here, but we might only ever come here once per year... Sorry, Sayaka-chan.  
**Emily:** Fuhahahaha\! It seems the time has come to prove my usefulness\!  
**Kaoru:** Huh? You know something about this?  
**Emily:** Yes\! Actually, there's a legend of a greatly powerful large scale aradama that was once in this area\!  
**Emily:** No precise records of it remain, but the legend itself has been passed down amongst the locals through oral tradition.  
**Emily:** According to them, that large aradama would lead a legion of smaller aradama in an attack on the nearby village. But each time, the local toji would exterminate the smaller aradama and the large one would be subdued.  
**Emily:** However, that large aradama could never be entirely suppressed, and so these conflicts continued over many generations--  
**Emily:** Until that lineage of toji was broken off. At the same time, for unknown reasons, the large aradama abruptly disappeared... Or that's how the legend goes.  
**Mirja:** I see. The part about the smaller aradama certainly corresponds to the current situation...  
**Mihono:** But, why do you know all that, Emily-san?  
**Emily:** Well that's simple\! I only visited this town in the first place to further investigate this legend\!  
**Kaoru:** If it's so simple, why didn't you say something sooner, huh?  
**Emily:** As it happens, my interest shifted to something else\! It completely slipped my mind\! Fuahahaha\!  
**Kaoru:** Ahh, I'm tired of talking to you. But, that legend...  
**Ellen:** Yes. It sounds like the Mashiko family, doesn't it?  
**Nene:** Ne-, nene-.  
**Mihono:** Eh? So then...  
**Mirja:** Hold that thought, Asakura Mihono. We can continue later.  
**Aradama:** GUAAAAAAAAAA\!  
**Kiyoka:** There they are\! They look just like the type from yesterday\!  
**Mihono:** We'll have to take care of the aradama first, then\!  

## 3: Fight for the Watermelon
**Aradama:** GUAAaaaa...  
**Yukari:** Good, we'll push the front-line forward. Instruct the toji in the rear to begin recovering noro.  
**Maki:** Understood\! Suzuka, Yomi, Yume\! From here on out, let no aradama approach Yukari-sama\!  
**Yomi:** I'm on it.  
**Yume:** Ehh\~\? I'm pretty sure Yukari-sama'll be fine on her own though\~\?  
**Maki:** Don't be like that. As the elite guard, this is our duty to fulfill.  
**Suzuka:** She's right, Yume. As the elite guard, we are the swords which form Yukari-sama's shield.  
**Yume:** If you say so... Ah, hey, by the way. Doesn't it seem like the aradama around here are only going after toji?  
**Suzuka:** Eh...?  
**Suzuka:** Now that you mention it, you may be right. The aradama could avoid us if they wanted, yet their only intent seems to be attacking us.  
**Maki:** Does that mean, with Yukari-sama's decision to push up the front-line, she anticipated this...? But why is it the aradama are only targeting toji?  
**Yukari:** Maki, Suzuka, keep your guard up\!  
**Aradama:** O-OOOoo oo...  
**Yukari:** You can't allow your mind to wander on a battlefield. Whatever the aradama's intent, we toji are here to defeat them. Think of nothing but fulfilling that objective.  
**Maki:** Yes ma'am\! Suzuka, I'm counting on you\!  
**Suzuka:** Of course, leave it to me.  
**Yume:** Ooh\~, they're getting into it\~\.  
**Yume:** Hey-, Yukari-sama-\! Since we're here together, why don't we have a contest between the two of us to see who can beat the most aradama\!  
**Yume:** And if I win, you'll buy me a watermelon afterwards\! A big round one\! You're fine with that, right-?  
**Yukari:** ...Fine, I have no issue with that. But only on the condition that you obey my orders. Those are the terms of our contest.  
**Yume:** Ahaha\! Yes-\! Then, it's about time I got serious-\!  
**Aradama:** GAAAAAAaaa...\!  
**Yume:** Ahahahaha\! More and more-\!  
**Maki:** Come back, Yume\! You're getting too far ahead\!  
**Yume:** Thbbbb-. This is between me and Yukari-sama. So I don't have to listen to you, Maki onee-san\!  
**Maki:** Ah-, I can't believe her...\!  
**Suzuka:** When she gets like this, Yume's quite the nuisance.  
**Yukari:** ...Yomi, go support Yume. However, so long as I live, let her act freely. Rather than being restricted under someone else, she can accomplish more this way.  
**Yomi:** I understand.  
**Yukari:** Maki, Suzuka, we're pushing forward as well.  

## 4: The Legend's Similarity
**Aradama:** GUOooo oo...  
**Mihono:** Pant... Pant... Pant...\!  
**Kiyoka:** I think that's the last of them... For now...  
**Hiyori:** Phew... Do you think we should take a break, everyone? We don't know how many aradama are lurking ahead, so we should rest while we can.  
**Mirja:** You're right, we should do that.  
**Kaoru:** Ahhh, I don't wanna get back up. Feels like there's way more of them than yesterday... If only somebody here would go get our stuff for us...  
**Emily:** What\!\? You expect me to carry your things now\!  
**Emily:** "Hooray, hooray, everyone-\! You can do it, you can do it, everyone-\!\" --Hasn't my cheering been enough for you?  
**Ellen:** All I remember is wondering who was making that racket...  
**Sayaka:** It gets busy while we're fighting, so I didn't notice.  
**Emily:** Ughh, how disheartening. I'll suppose I'm off to stare into space for a bit then.  
**Kaoru:** Yeah, go right ahead.  
**Mirja:** ...By the way, Yanase Mai. I'd like to ask your opinion on something, while we have the time.  
**Mai:** I was about to bring something up myself. It's about the aradama, isn't it?  
**Mihono:** Did you two find out anything?  
**Mirja:** Actually... I'm not entirely sure of it yet, but at times the aradama we've encountered seem to be deliberately pursuing us toji.  
**Mai:** Even when injured they don't try to run away, and when they're far enough that it wouldn't be odd if they ignored us, they suddenly change course to attack.  
**Mihono:** Huh? Really? I didn't notice any of that.  
**Mihono:** But, why would they do that? Do the aradama here only go after toji?  
**Ellen:** I think the Mashiko family's story might help explain.  
**Mihono:** Oh yeah, didn't you say they were sort of alike before?  
**Ellen:** Yes. Kaoru will explain the details.  
**Kaoru:** Oi...\! Fine, if I have to...  
**Kaoru:** In Tochigi, near the Futarasan shrine, "Nene" would go on rampages. For hundreds of years we built up a long history of fighting it.  
**Kaoru:** Anyway, after all that fighting, we came to an understanding with "Nene"...  
**Kaoru:** So what's similar is, in this legend with the big aradama, the "toji from around here had been fighting it for countless generations" part.  
**Kaoru:** That's why I was wondering if maybe that lineage of toji had the same line of thinking as the Mashikos.  
**Mirja:** To summarize, you believe that large aradama could have ended up in a similar relationship with those old toji as the current Mashiko family shares with Nene. Is that correct?  
**Kaoru:** Nah, I wouldn't go that far. But it seems like the big aradama might have decided those toji were a worthy rival, right?  
**Mashiko:** The proof is that, when this toji lineage ended, that's when the big aradama disappeared all of a sudden too. Without its rivals around, it wasn't interested.  
**Mirja:** I see...  
**Mai:** But then in this case, why would that aradama return right now...?  
**Ellen:** Because it found some interesting rivals, don't you think?  
**Kiyoka:** Wait, you mean... Us?  
**Kaoru:** Yep. Probably.  
**Mihono:** So like, the outbreak of aradama yesterday was to test our skills... Or something?  
**Mirja:** Then, after making its judgment, it began to act seriously? This sounds stranger than fiction, if I'm being honest...  
**Sayaka:** But the story fits. The aradama are only targeting toji.  
**Mai:** Well, what do you think, Nene-chan?  
**Nene:** Ne\~\?  
**Ellen:** Seems like he's tilting his head hard in confusion.  
**Kaoru:** Well, it figures.  
**Emily:** Ah-\!\? What's the big idea, everyone\!\? Why does it seem like you just had a very interesting conversation without me\!\?  
**Mihono:** Ah, you didn't get to hear...  
**Kaoru:** ...Well we can't rest forever; we should get going.   
**Ellen:** Agreed.  
**Mihono:** Okay-\! Let's keep giving our all\!  
**Emily:** Wait, this isn't fair\!\? Please tell me all about it too\!\?  

## 5: Origami Yukari's Seriousness
**Yukari:** ...Seems like all aradama in this area have been eliminated.  
**Yume:** Yu\~kari-sama\~\. How many aradama have you gotten so far?  
**Yukari:** Forty or fifty.  
**Yume:** Wait, are you guessing\!\? Come on, take this contest seriously.  
**Yume:** If you don't know exactly how much, how're we supposed to know who won?  
**Maki:** Yume, focus on the mission at hand. If you don't, you'll screw up sooner or later, you know?  
**Yume:** These aradama are never gonna hit me, so don't worry about it.  
**Suzuka:** Really, you can be such a handful. However, it does seem the theory of these aradama only targeting toji was correct.  
**Maki:** Right. Despite all the aradama we've encountered, none of the riot officers have been attacked.  
**Yukari:** Maki, Yume.  
**Maki:** Ah, I'm sorry. Are we pushing forward?  
**Yukari:** No... It's coming. Get ready.  
**Yume:** Nn?  
**Large Aradama:** GUAAAAAAAAAAA-\!\!\!  
**Maki:** Wha...\!\?  
**Yuma:** Whoa-\! It's huge-\!  
**Suzuka:** And not just that aradama\!  
**Aradama:** GURURURU...\!  
**Maki:** It brought more along with it... There must be... No, it's impossible to estimate. There's too many.  
**Large Aradama:** GUAAAAAAAAAAA-\!\!\!  
**Yukari:** You must be the legendary aradama of these parts. It seems Tanaka Taeko guessed correctly.  
**Yume:** Hmmm, I don't really get it, but that big one's the boss, right?  
**Yume:** Then that makes this easy, Yukari-sama. Whoever beats the boss is the winner\! Hyaaaah\!  
**Yume:** Ahaha\! It's pretty tough\! But it won't last long against me\~\!  
**Large Aradama:** GUAAAAAAA-\!\!  
**Yume:** Ah-, you're running away\!\? --G-Get back here-\!  
**Yukari:** Yume, stop\! Don't give chase\!  
**Yume:** B-But--  
**Yukari:** Obey my orders. That's what you promised.  
**Yume:** Urgh... Fine, I get it-\!  
**Yukari:** More importantly, Yume. Aside from the fleeing giant aradama, there's countless prey for you here, isn't there?  
**Aradama:** GURURURU....\!  
**Maki:** Yukari-sama... But what do you plan to do about the escaped aradama?  
**Yukari:** We aren't the only toji responsible here. Defeating the aradama at their source is key, but our original objective was to eliminate every aradama that appeared.  
**Yukari:** Considering that, are you going to ignore this number of aradama? Do you believe anyone besides ourselves could deal with all this at once?  
**Maki:** I... You have a point...  
**Suzuka:** Our place is here, Maki-san. No one aside from Yukari-sama and we elite guard can accomplish this.  
**Maki:** ...Ahh, you're right.  
**Yukari:** Yomi, continue supporting Yume. However, there's no need to hold back any longer. If you feel it's necessary, destroy as many aradama as you can manage.  
**Yomi:** Understood. I'll do everything in my power.  
**Yukari:** Maki, Suzuka, I trust my back to you.  
**Maki:** Yes ma'am\!  
**Suzuka:** Even if it costs my life\!  
**Yukari:** Yume. Our contest will be decided by numbers after all. Though, do you truly think you can beat me?  
**Yume:** Wah, Yukari-sama's getting serious-\! Ahahaha\! But still, there's no way I'm gonna lose this time\!  

## 6: Large Aradama Suppression Order
**Kiyoka:** ...Is it just me? It feels like we aren't running into as many aradama anymore.  
**Mihono:** Yeah, I noticed it too... It was nonstop just a little while ago.  
**Emily:** Err, someone's phone is ringing?  
**Mihono:** --Ahh, that's mine\!  
**Mihono:** Hello? Oh, Tanaka-sensei\!  
**Mihono:** Yes... Yes... Yes... Ehhh\!\?  
**Mihono:** I got it\! I'll tell the others\!  
**Mirja:** ...What did Tanaka-sensei have to say? You sounded rather surprised by it.  
**Mihono:** Y-Yeah. Well... Yukari-sama and her elite guard's unit ran into this tough looking boss aradama.  
**Mihono:** But it had a ton of other aradama with it, and suppressing them took higher priority...  
**Ellen:** Then what about that boss aradama?  
**Mihono:** So it sounds like it ran off somewhere. And it's up to us to beat it.  
**Kaoru:** Gimme a break. What's the point if they're not gonna defeat the last boss?  
**Nene:** --Nene\! Ne-, nenene-\!  
**Kaoru:** Nene? What's with you all of a sudden?  
**Large Aradama:** GUAAAAAAAAA-\!\!\!  
**Hiyori:** What was that\!\? That roar just now\!\?  
**Mai:** It must be, that tough aradama...\!\?  
**Kiyoka:** Um... Do you think, maybe, it's calling to us...?  
**Mihono:** What... Like it's calling us out?  
**Sayaka:** ...It might be.  
**Emily:** E-Err\~ This might be a naive question, but, can you actually beat it? This aradama that countless generations of toji didn't destroy.  
**Mihono:** Well...  
**Kiyoka:** But... We have to go, don't we?  
**Mirja:** Yes. No matter what sort of aradama we face, so long as it might threaten people's lives, we can't afford to leave it.  
**Kaoru:** Whatever, let's get this over with... If things get rough, we'll just run away I guess.  
**Hiyori:** Of course, we'll stick together to the end.  
**Mihono:** Kiyoka, Mirja-san, and everybody...\!  
**Mihono:** Alright\! Let's do this\! This time for sure, we'll take back our summer vacation\!  

## 7: Summer Vacation Is Right Before Our Eyes\!
**Aradama:** GAAAaaa aaa...  
**Yukari:** ...That was the last of them. Maki, is anyone hurt?  
**Maki:** Pant... Pant... Pant... N-No... Everyone... Should be fine...  
**Suzuka:** Yukari... Sama... I'm sorry... You had to do most of the work, in the end...  
**Yume:** Pant... Wheeze... Wheeze... Why don't... You have... A single drop of sweat, Yukari... Sama...?  
**Yomi:** Pant... Pant...  
**Yukari:** Just try not to move for a while, all of you. You fought well. Rest for now.  
**Maki:** I have no excuse... As a member of the elite guard, to be so unable to protect Yukari-sama...  
**Yukari:** Maki, your sternness is a strength of yours, but not if it leads to you being overly critical of yourself.  
**Yukari:** If that's how feel, you only need to become stronger. Understand?  
**Maki:** ...Yes ma'am\!  
**Yume:** Ah, oh yeah-- In the middle of fighting, I totally forgot to keep count\!  
**Yume:** Hey, Yomi onee-san. Do you know?  
**Yomi:** The number of aradama you defeated, Tsubakuro-san? No, I was too busy to keep track.  
**Yume:** Ehh, then...? My contest with Yukari-sama...?  
**Yomi:** If we don't know the numbers, then we can't declare a winner.  
**Yume:** No way\~\!  
**Yume:** Awww\~\... I tried my hardest too... I really... Wanted that watermelon...  
**Yukari:** Yume, don't be so down. You can buy what you want when we get back. I'll allow it.  
**Yume:** Ehh\!\? Seriously\!\? Alright\!  
**Yume:** Hey, Onee-sans-\! Let's play split the watermelon later\!  
**Suzuka:** Honestly, that girl... There's simply no refusing her, is there.  
**Maki:** But Yukari-sama, will the investigation team members you ordered to suppress the large aradama be able to handle themselves?  
**Yukari:** There's no need to worry. They're toji, the same as you, after all.  
**Large Aradama:** GUAAAAAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Mirja:** There it is\! That must be the one, from the legend--  
**Kiyoka:** I-It's so big... More than I imagined...  
**Mai:** Can we really win against something like that...?  
**Sayaka:** ...I don't know.  
**Emily:** Hawawawawa... I propose we try for a strategic sort of retreat\!  
**Mihono:** Hmmm... Hey, do you think that when we beat that aradama, we might become friends?  
**Mihono:** Like what happened with the Mashiko family and Nene-chan. If we come to respect each other's strength, or something.  
**Hiyori:** Mihono, you... Heh, I can't tell if you're that clueless or that confident.  
**Ellen:** Mihomiho doesn't have an ounce of fear in her\! She's already decided we're going to win.  
**Mihono:** I mean, I'm not sure how, but I'm sure we can do it\!  
**Mihono:** We've all been fighting together since yesterday, you know. With all of us together, I don't care who we're up against, we'd never lose.  
**Mirja:** Fu... I can't call it logical or tactical, but it's certainly like you.  
**Kiyoka:** I agree with Hono-chan\! If we all fight together, I know we'll win\!  
**Large Aradama:** GUAAAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Mihono:** Let's do this, everyone\! Our summer vacation's right before our eyes\!  

## 8: One Summer's Memories
**Large Aradama:** GUAAAAaaaa aaaa... ........ ....  
**Mihono:** Did we beat it...?  
**Mirja:** Watanabe Emily. Can you check its noro?  
**Emily:** Ah, could you give me some room for a minute? Like that, thank you.  
**Emily:** Hmmhmm... Hoho, now this is interesting. There's not a single drop of noro in here\!  
**Hiyori:** Which means... We didn't truly defeat it?  
**Kaoru:** Ahh, maybe. But that's enough, isn't it?  
**Kaoru:** That aradama went all out against us and used up all its strength, so it should be quiet for a while, right?  
**Sayaka:** Mm. We did what we needed to.  
**Mirja:** ...That's right. Why don't we leave uncovering the truth of the matter to those of the Special Ritual Squad assigned to process this matter?  
**Mihono:** What if the toji back then went through this every year?  
**Ellen:** Then after repeating these heated battles every summer, eventually toji and aradama might form a bond... You never know\!  
**Nene:** Ne-\!  
**Kiyoka:** Phew... At least, that's this time done with. Now...  
**Kiyoka:** We can finally get back to our summer vacation\!  
**Mihono:** Sounds good\! Then let's go right back to Mai's family's beach\! I wanna play in the sea till my hands get all wrinkly\!  
**Mihono:** Here it comes-\! Take that-\!  
**Kiyoka:** Kyaaa\! But, I'm not giving up-\!  
**Ellen:** Did you hear, Hiyoyon? Apparently Yukari-sama and the elite guard are enjoying some time off just down the beach from here.  
**Hiyori:** The elite guard is one thing, but Yukari-sama...? Hmph, she would never do something like that. I don't believe it one bi--pfffhtpht\!  
**Ellen:** Ahahaha\! You were wide open\!  
**Kaoru:** They're sure having a good time-. But the way an adult enjoys the ocean is meant to be laid back and relaxed, like this. Am I right, Nene?  
**Nene:** Ne-\!  
**Mai:** Everyone, the shaved ice is ready-\!  
**Mihono:** Snore-, snore-... Nnn, if I eat any more my stomach'll freeze...  
**Kiyoka:** Let's come back next year, everyone... Mumble mumble...  
**Mirja:** This won't do... One slice of watermelon per person...  
**Taeko:** They're all sound asleep. Those are some nice expressions.  
**Taeko:** ...Except for that one.  
**Emily:** Uheheh... All this precious data... Right down to their three sizes... Uhehehehh...
