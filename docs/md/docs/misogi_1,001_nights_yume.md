## [Misogi - Yume: Start\]: Why Won't You Let Me\!
**Yume:** Maki-onee-san\.  
**Maki:** Nn\? Oh, it's you, Yume\.  
**Maki:** Sorry, but I don't have a lot of time right now\. If this'll take long, can we save it for later\?  
**Yume:** You always seem like you're busy, Maki-onee-san\. What's going on today\?  
**Maki:** We got a report about an aradama, but it seems like a pretty large scale one\. There's nobody available who can handle it\.  
**Yume:** A large scale aradama\!\!  
**Yume:** Then, isn't it okay if I go\?  
**Maki:** You're here on standby, Yume\.  
**Maki:** You don't need to do anything more than the work we give you\.  
**Maki:** I have to get going\.  
**Yume:** \.\.\.She just left me\. If there's a large scale aradama, they could've just told me\.  
**Yume:** Ahhh, this is so boring-\. I could do it fine all by myself; I don't even need a unit or anything\.  
**Yume:** \.\.\.When I joined the elite guard, I thought I'd get to sortie a whole lot more and fight a bunch of tough aradama\.\.\. But all I'm ever doing is waiting at home\!  
**Yume:** I can't show how off how strong I am at all like this\.\.\.  
**Yume:** \.\.\.I got it\!  
**Yume:** If I prove to them I'm strong, I bet they'll let me go on more sorties\.  
**Yomi:** You want to fight a match against me\?  
**Yume:** Yeah\. Cause they aren't letting me go suppress any aradama at all\.  
**Yume:** So, if I beat all the onee-sans in the elite guard, you'll have to think I'm really strong\.  
**Yomi:** \.\.\.  
**Yomi:** I don't feel there's any need for us to fight\.\.\. The outcome is obvious\.  
**Yume:** But, you won't know that till we try it\!  
**Yomi:** \.\.\.Won't I\?  
**Yume:** Anyway\.\.\. Here I come\!  
**Yomi:** \.\.\.gh\.  
**Yume:** H-Huh\? Are you done already\?  
**Yomi:** \.\.\.The outcome was obvious\.  
**Yume:** Wait, that's what you meant\!\?  
**Yomi:** This is as far as my skills with a sword go\.  
**Yume:** I can't show how strong I am with that\.\.\. Aghh, geez, I'll go to the next one\! Suzuka-onee-san\!  
**Yume:** YAAAH\!\!  
**Suzuka:** You're good, Yume\!  
**Yume:** You too, Suzuka-onee-san\! But\.\.\. if that's all you've got, this'll be over in no time\!  
**Suzuka:** I thought that-- You would come like that\!  
**Yume:** Huh\!\?  
**Yume/Suzuka:** --\!\!  
**Suzuka:** And I thought I had gotten you with that counter\.\.\. So you can even react to that\.  
**Yume:** That got me by surprise\! That was a little bit close there\!  
**Suzuka:** \.\.\.Those reflexes of yours are frightening\.  
**Yume:** This is getting fun, right, Suzuka-onee-san\? Let's do it some more\!  
**Suzuka:** \.\.\.This is my loss\. You are strong, Yume\.  
**Yume:** Yeah, I'm strong, right\? So that's why, you can send me on a bunch more suppression missions, okay\?  
**Suzuka:** \.\.\.R-Right, I'll keep that in mind\.  
**Yume:** All that's left is Maki-onee-san\.\.\. and Yukari-sama\. If I beat Yukari-sama, everybody'll know I'm strong\.  

## [Misogi - Yume: End\]: I'll Get Even Stronger\!
**Maki:** I'm back\.  
**Yume:** I was waiting for you, Maki-onee-san\.  
**Maki:** Yume\.\.\.\? Oh right, before I left to suppress that aradama, you were saying something\.  
**Yume:** \.\.\.Fight a match against me, Maki-onee-san\.  
**Maki:** A match\.\.\. As the first seat, that's something I can't afford to lose\.  
**Yume:** Well I'm not gonna lose either\.  
**Yume:** Cause I'll\.\.\. I'm going to show tons of people just how strong I am\.  
**Yume:** \.\.\.Maki-onee-san hits so hard-\. My hands are all tingly\.  
**Maki:** What's the matter, Yume\! If you're not going to come attack me, I'll end things like this\!  
**Yume:** I think you're getting ahead of yourself\!  
**Maki:** Too soft\!  
**Yume:** What part\!  
**Maki:** Tch\!  
**Yume:** You sure are strong, Maki-onee-san\! But, I'm even stronger\!  
**Maki:** That's something\.\.\. you only get to say after you win\!  
**Yume:** Yeah\.\.\. I'll win\! I'm\.\.\. stronger than you, Maki-onee-san\!  
**Yume:** Hooray-\! I beat Maki-onee-san\!  
**Maki:** Damnit\.\.\. Am I supposed to feel frustrated that I lost, or proud my kouhai's grown so promising\.\.\. These are some mixed up feelings\.  
**Yume:** So now you know I'm strong, right\? And, starting tomorrow, you'll put me on lots of sorties\?  
**Maki:** Sorties\? Wait, that doesn't\.\.\.  
**Yume:** \.\.\.No good yet, huh\. So I've gotta beat Yukari-sama after all\.\.\.  
**Maki:** H-Hey, Yume\? That's not what I meant\.\.\.  
**Yume:** I'm gonna go over there real quick, Maki-onee-san\.  
**Yume:** Yukari-sama\~\.  
**Yukari:** Yume\? What do you need\?  
**Yume:** Have a fight with me\.  
**Yukari:** I don't have time to entertain you now\. Though\.\.\. If we can do it here, I'll keep you company\.  
**Yukari:** Come whenever you're ready\.  
**Yume:** Whenever I'm ready\.\.\. When should I\.\.\.  
**Yume:** Go\!  
**Yukari:** \.\.\.  
**Yume:** You dodged that\!\?  
**Yume:** \.\.\.Ahah\! This time, I'll do something even more ama-- zing\!  
**Yukari:** To make me draw my okatana\.\.\.\.\.\. That is impressive\.  
**Yume:** If we didn't get this far, we'd both be bored, right, Yukari-sama\?  
**Yume:** So then, I'll do even more-\!  
**Yume:** That's what I want, Yukari-sama-\!  
**Yukari:** \.\.\.It's about time now\. Sorry, Yume\.  
**Yume:** Uwah\!\?  
**Yukari:** That's all for today\.  
**Yume:** J-Just one more time\! If I don't beat you, they won't let me go on any sorties\!  
**Yukari:** Where did you get that idea\? The reason you go on so few sorties is because Shidou and Konohana are concerned about your body\.  
**Yume:** Huh\.\.\.\? \.\.\.But, they never told me about that\.  
**Yume:** And anyway, Maki-onee-san and Suzuka-onee-san worry way too much\!  
**Yukari:** You shouldn't say that\.  
**Yume:** But still\.\.\.  
**Yukari:** \.\.\.Yume\. You put up a fine attack\. I'll play with you again, so stay diligent\.  
**Yume:** Okay\!  
**Yume:** (Ahh, that was so fun\! I'll get even stronger next time, and then I'll even beat Yukari-sama\!\)  
**Yume:** \.\.\.I'm really glad I joined the elite guard\!

## [1,001 Nights - Yume: Start\]: A Request
**Maki:** Excuse us, Yukari-sama\.  
**Yukari:** You're here\. I have a request for you from the Sword Administration Bureau\.  
**Suzuka:** A request\?  
**Yume:** Is it aradama\!\? Yukari-sama, did a really tough aradama show up\!\?  
**Yukari:** \.\.\.That's not it\. This request comes from the public relations department\.  
**Yume:** Really-\? What a letdown-\.  
**Yomi:** What sort of request is it\?  
**Yukari:** You've been requested to participate in an indoor pool's event\.  
**Yume:** But there's no point in us going, is there\?  
**Yukari:** Don't say that, Yume\.  
**Suzuka:** Listen to Yukari-sama, Yume\. This too is fine work for the elite guard\.  
**Yume:** Then you onee-sans can go do it on your own\.  
**Maki:** Yume\! Don't act so spoiled\.  
**Yukari:** Then, Yume\. After you finish this request, I'll be your opponent\. It's been a while\.  
**Yume:** You mean it\!\? Then, I guess I have to go\.  
**Yume:** But, you have to promise, Yukari-sama\! You can't go saying you take it back after this\!  
**Yukari:** Good\. I promise\.  
**Yomi:** Is that alright\?  
**Yukari:** It's not too much to ask\. And\.\.\.  
**Yume:** Yesss-\! I finally get to fight against Yukari-sama-\!  
**Yukari:** If she's that happy about it\.  
**Yomi:** \.\.\.I see\.  
**Maki:** Yukari-sama, can you share with me the details of the event\? I'll have to get notes ready in advance for the speech\.  
**Suzuka:** Wait, Maki-san\. I'll take care of that\.  
**Maki:** Thanks, Suzuka\. I'm leaving it to you\.  
**Suzuka:** Of course; you can rely on me\.  
**Yukari:** Though, about your assignment this time\.\.\. You won't be part of a ceremony\.  
**Yukari:** You will be giving a dance performance as part of the pool's Arabian event\.  
**Yume:** Eh\.\.\.\!\?  
**Yume:** Instead of listening to some boring speeches at a ceremony, we're dancing\?  

## [1,001 Nights - Yume: End\]: A Promise for Next Time 
--The day of the event\.

  
**Maki:** We have to wear these\!\?  
**Yume:** You don't like it, Maki-onee-san\? They're so cute though\.  
**Maki:** Look how much stomach it shows\.\.\. I can't wear something that cute\!  
**Suzuka:** Yes\.\.\. It's embarrassing for me as well\.   
**Yume:** Why don't you want to wear it that bad though\?  
**Yume:** It doesn't really feel like something you'd say, Maki-onee-san\. You'd be more like, \"All clothes are the same-\!\"  
**Maki:** \.\.\.I don't think all clothes are the same\.  
**Maki:** And I'm just\.\.\. a little self-conscious about my stomach\.  
**Yume:** You mean cause it'll be cold\?  
**Maki:** That's not it\.  
**Maki:** \.\.\.Isn't my stomach way too toned compared to everybody\?  
**Suzuka:** My, were you really worried about that\?  
**Yume:** You're a real workout monster, Maki-onee-san-\.  
**Yomi:** We're out of time, everyone\. Please hurry and change\.  
**Yume:** Okaaay\.  
**Suzuka:** So she says\. Time to find your resolve, Maki-san\.\.\.  
**Maki:** But\.\.\. Gh, I guess this is a mission too\!  
**Yume:** Hmhmhmm\~\! And, turn here\!  
**Yume:** Ahaha\! I didn't think dancing would be this fun\!  
**Maki:** You were the one who didn't want to do this the most at first, Yume, and now you're having the most fun with it\.  
**Suzuka:** Isn't it charming to see her act her age\?  
**Maki:** \.\.\.That's true\.  
**Yume:** Geez\! Maki-onee-san, you're messing up the rhythm\.  
**Maki:** Huh\!\?  
**Yomi:** \.\.\.  
**Yume:** Yomi-onee-san, you've gotta smile more\!  
**Yomi:** \.\.\.Was I not smiling\?  
**Yume:** You haven't smiled for a second-\!  
**Suzuka:** Fufu, an event like this isn't so bad, is it, Yume\.  
**Yume:** Yeah\! I want us all to do this again\!
