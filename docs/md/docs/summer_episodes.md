## [Summer Uniform - Ellen: Start\]: Meeting Up With Kaoru and Nene\~
**Kaoru:** Are you guys already getting into it-\?  
**Nene:** Nene\~\.  
**Ellen:** Kaoru\~\! I'm glad you made it\~\. Good work on your mission\.  
**Kaoru:** Getting R&R is something I specialize in, just as much as orders to wait on standby and break\.  
**Kaoru:** Actually, you guys haven't finished up the barbecue yet, have you\?  
**Ellen:** No problem\. We still have plenty of ingredients left-\. You and Nene can both eat your fill\.  
**Nene:** Ne-\!  
**Kaoru:** Ooh, you've got some pretty good meat here\. You really went all out\.  
**Ellen:** That's the beef that Mihomiho brought\. She said she used all her spending money\!  
**Kaoru:** Is that so\. Though, I'm not seeing Mihono herself around\?  
**Chie:** Mihono-chan and Kiyoka-chan are taking a little break after eating\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** Naonao, could you save the meat you're grilling now for Kaoru\?  
**Uraga Nao:** Sure thing\. The hard workers among us need to make sure to get enough nourishment\~\.  
**Kaoru:** The president must have me confused for a workhorse or something\. She doesn't even give me carrots either\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** We have carrots here\. Go on and eat up-\.  
**Kaoru:** No way; let me get some meat first\!  
**Ellen:** Fufu, I'm only joking\. Here you go, ready to eat\. You can have a drink too\.  
**Kaoru:** Ohh, I sorta feel bad making you getting everything for me\. Why're you doing all this anyway\?  
**Chie:** Isn't it simply that she's happy you're here, Kaoru-san\?  
**Ellen:** Hey, Chie-, don't tell her that-\.  
**Ellen:** You quit looking at me too, Kaoru\. Your meat's getting cold\.  
**Kaoru:** Then, I'll dig in\. --Ohm\!  
**Kaoru:** Sho good\.\.\.\!\? I've gotta give Mihono my thanks\.  
**Ellen:** That's the meat we all fought to get back from the aradama\. So go ahead and savor it\.  
**Kaoru:** You've been working hard too, huh\. [chew chew\]\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** I wish this kind of R&R would get turned into one of my duties too\.  
**Ellen:** That's for sure-\. We could all go have fun at lots of different places\.  
**Ellen:** Ah, you should try the ones she grilled slow at low temperature too\.  
**Kaoru:** I guess I'll have some of that then\.  
**Nene:** Nene-\!  
**Nao:** Not yet\~\. These ones need to cook a little longer\. Understand\~\?  
**Nene:** Ne\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** The barbecue boss's orders are absolute, Kaoru\.  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.R-Right\. Anyway, Mihono and Kiyoka still aren't back yet\?  
**Ellen:** They'll be back soon\. Let's all enjoy the barbecue while we wait for them\.  
**Kaoru:** Sounds like a plan-\. Ahh, this stuff really is good\.

## [Summer Uniform - Ellen: End\]: After a Mission, You Take a Break\!
**Kaoru:** Having somebody else grill for you isn't bad, but you've gotta try barbecuing your own meat\.  
**Kaoru:** When it starts sizzling, the sound alone's enough to taste it\.  
**Nene:** Ne\~\.  
**Ellen:** That's definitely one way to enjoy it-\.  
**Kaoru:** The smell when it's grilling's good too\.  
**Ellen:** [yawn\]\.\.\. Nice weather and a full stomach\.\.\. I'm getting sleepy\.  
**Ellen:** Kohagura Ellen, now switching over to comfy mode\~\.  
**Kaoru:** Skewers are ready; you want one, Ellen\?  
**Ellen:**  Nnn\.\.\. Getting up's too much work\. I wonder if I caught this from you, Kaoru\?  
**Ellen:** Since we're always together, it must have only been a matter of time\.  
**Kaoru:** Don't blame me if you're turning into a slacker\. I'm the one wanting to slack off here\.  
**Kaoru:** So, you want one or don't you\?  
**Ellen:** What to do-\. You did go and grill it yourself, so\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** If you'll feed it to me, I'll gladly have one\. --Ahhhhn\.  
**Kaoru:** What're you talking about\.\.\. What are you, a baby bird\?  
**Ellen:** If I'm a baby bird, then you're the mama bird\.  
**Ellen:** You're good at looking after others, so you seem like you'd make a good mother, Kaoru\.  
**Kaoru:** I'm not so sure about that\. Here, it's hot, so be careful\.  
**Ellen:** Thank you\. You cooked it nicely\.  
**Kaoru:** It's not fun, but cooking's nothing much-\.  
**Ellen:** You really brought the flavor out, Kaoru\.  
**Kaoru:** Anybody could do it if they tried\.  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.Or maybe not\. The stuff Nao cooked was really good\.  
**Ellen:** [chew chew\]\.\.\. But, I like it this way\.  
**Kaoru:** Well, that's good to hear then\.  
**Kaoru:** Ahh\.\.\. Now that I've had my fill, I'm getting sleepy too\.  
**Ellen:** Want to take a nap with me\? They say \"a sleeping child is a growing child\"\.  
**Kaoru:** Don't you think you've already grown enough\?  
**Ellen:** Actually, I'm still in the middle of my growing phase\.  
**Nene:** Ne-\!\?  
**Kaoru:** You're gonna get even bigger\!\?  
**Kaoru:** So this's what they call a dangerously stratified society\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** But, back to what you were saying\. An afternoon nap doesn't sound too bad\. I wish I had the spare time to take one every day\.  
**Ellen:** Agreed\. Kaoru, don't go pushing yourself too hard, alright-\?  
**Kaoru:** You know that's not up to me-\. I'd do everything I can to get out of it\.  
**Kaoru:** Anyway, don't worry about me\. But thanks\.  
**Ellen:** Fufu, you don't have to thank me for it\. Just, no need to be shy with me\. Got it\?  
**Kaoru:** Sure\.

## [Summer Uniform - Mihono: Start\]: Because of the Horizon Alliance\?
**Mihono:** Tomorrow's barbecue is going to be great, huh, Kiyoka\.  
**Kiyoka:** Yeah\. Though, it's a little sad we couldn't have everyone from the investigation team come along to refresh themselves\.  
**Mihono:** We can't always get everyone together at once\. There's missions to take care of\.  
**Mihono:** But Chii-nee and Mirja-san'll be coming, won't they\?  
**Kiyoka:** Yeah\. And it seems like Ellen-san and one of Mirja-san's friends from Ayanokouji will be joining us tomorrow\.  
**Kiyoka:** It would be even better if Juujou-san, Kaoru-san, and Kofuki-san were coming too; then we could hold one of our meetings-\.  
**Mihono:** You get pretty excited, huh Kiyoka\.\.\. About doing stuff for the Alliance\.  
**Kiyoka:** Mmhm\! After all, it's a lot of fun, getting to talk about fashion and beauty topics with everyone\.  
**Kiyoka:** I like being able to chat a little when we're all together after a mission too\.  
**Mihono:** Ah, I sorta get what you mean\!  
**Kiyoka:** And also, it gives me an chance to talk more with Juujou-san\.  
**Mihono:** Do you and Juujou-san talk a lot\? Ever since she joined the Alliance\?  
**Kiyoka:** I'd already started talking with her a little because of a book\. I lent it to her just a bit before the tournament\.  
**Kiyoka:** Though, back then, Juujou-san sort of had this hard to approach feeling\.  
**Kiyoka:** But she isn't like that at all anymore lately\. She texts me casually too\.  
**Mihono:** So that's how it is-\.  
**Mihono:** Juujou-san's pretty interesting once you talk to her, isn't she\.  
**Kiyoka:** Yeah\. She has a kind of uniqueness to her\. I think she's really nice\.  
**Kiyoka:** That's why, I wanted us to get closer, so I was hoping Juujou-san might come along to the barbecue\.  
**Mihono:** Since you go to school together, I'm sure you'll have a lot of other chances\.  
**Kiyoka:** That's true\.  
**Mihono:** Anyway, the meat that I'm bringing tomorrow is some really good stuff, so you should look forward to it-\. I spent a lot of money on it-\.  
**Kiyoka:** You went that far\.\.\. You're serious about this, aren't you, Hono-chan\.  
**Mihono:** I'm going all out to have a good time tomorrow\!  
**Kiyoka:** That reminds me, they say chicken meat is good for breast enhancement, but, do you think it's actually true-\?  
**Kiyoka:** There's rumors that it's all made up\.  
**Mihono:** I'm not sure\? Though, the meat for tomorrow is beef\!  
**Mihono:** And I bet it's not going to lose to chicken\!  
**Kiyoka:** Well, I'm looking forward to trying your meat, Hono-chan\!  
**Mihono:** The weather forecast said it'd be sunny, so it'll be perfect for barbecuing\!  
**Mihono:** Ahh, I wish it were tomorrow already-\.

## [Summer Uniform - Mihono: End\]: Isn't Meat Best After All
The day of the barbecue--

  
**Mihono:** Okaaay, I think I'll grill up some meat\! It's meat time\~\!  
**Uraga Nao:** Oh, Asakura-san\. Need me to grill more\~\?  
**Mihono:** Ah, no, I'll be fine\! I want to try grilling it myself\!  
**Mihono:** The barbecue boss should enjoy her own food\!  
**Nao:** Grilling it yourself is fun too, isn't it\~\.  
**Nao:** Wait\.\.\. When did I start letting the barbecue boss title slide\.\.\.\?  
**Mirja:** It's the truth, so isn't it better this way\?  
**Nao:** Mirja, if you're going to be like that, I'm not giving you a taste of this perfect combination of baguettes al ajillo\~\.  
**Nao:** Want some, Setouchi-san\~\?  
**Chie:** It looks delicious; I think I will\.  
**Mirja:** Urgh\.\.\. So your next strategy is to starve me out\. I'll stop spreading the word of the barbecue boss\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** What should I do now\~\. Ah, skewers might be good\!  
**Kiyoka:** Hono-chan\! Hold on a minute\!  
**Mihono:** Wawah\!\? Kiyoka\!\? Wh-What's up\?  
**Kiyoka:** Hono-chan, your meat was so tasty that we were forgetting something important\!  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.\?  
**Kiyoka:** Wasn't our plan to eat what Chie-san and the others were eating, to learn the trick to getting bigger\?  
**Kiyoka:** If we eat any more meat, we won't have room for anything else\.  
**Mihono:** Buttt\.\.\. Everybody's eating meat, so maybe meat's the best thing to eat\!  
**Kiyoka:** That's\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** It's a good idea, right\?  
**Kiyoka:** I can't disagree with that\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** \.\.\.B-But, no\. You almost got me, but, if meat is what we already have in common, then we have to try copying them with things besides meat\!  
**Mihono:** Ehh\~\.\.\. Ah, wait, hang on\. Just the stuff I'm grilling right now then\~\.\.\. It'd be a waste otherwise\!  
**Kiyoka:** It's not good to waste food, is it\.  
**Mihono:** So you get it\! Meat's definitely good for growing\! Boobs are meat too, right\!  
**Kiyoka:** Then, let's quickly eat up the meat you're grilling now\!  
**Mihono:** Eh\?  
**Kiyoka:** Eat faster, Hono-chan\.\.\. [chew chew\]\.  
**Kiyoka:** Mirja-san and Uraga-san are putting something on their baguettes now\.  
**Mihono:** Uh\.\.\. Kiyoka\? I think we should slow down and enjoy the taste a little more\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** Okay\.\.\. It sure is tasty, huh\!  
**Mihono:** It's tasty, so let's eat it more slowly\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** We can't do that; if we don't eat fast, we won't be able to eat all the same foods\.  
**Mihono:** Kgh\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** A-Alright, Kiyoka\! [chew chew\]\.\.\.\!  
**Mihono:** (Kiyoka\.\.\. She's way too eager about Alliance stuff\.\.\. I mean, sometimes she puts on too much pressure\!\)  
**Mihono:** (All I wanted was to really savor the meat\~\!\)  
**Chie:** Fufu, look at Mihono-chan and Kiyoka-chan scarfing down the meat\.  
**Chie:** They must have really been excited for the barbecue\.

## [Summer Uniform - Hiyori: Start\]: Getting Out of the Rain
**Kanami:** Uwah-\!\? It's pouring rain, Hiyori-chan\! I should've brought my umbrella\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** You know, this wouldn't be a problem if you came prepared\.  
**Hiyori:** What do you want to do\? My umbrella's a little small, but do you want to try it\?  
**Kanami:** We're sharing an umbrella then\?  
**Hiyori:** Don't say stupid things\.  
**Kanami:** Hey, I was only joking\. I'm checking online, so give me a minute\.  
**Kanami:** Ah, it looks like the rain clouds will clear up in a little bit\. How about we wait here for a while\?  
**Hiyori:** The rainy season's supposed to be over, but we still get bad weather\. Is that what they call returning rains\?  
**Hiyori:** Really, if only we'd get clear blue skies\.  
**Kanami:** Want to try making teru teru bouzu\?  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.Better not\. Aradama might get involved again\.  
**Hiyori:** Which reminds me\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** What is it\?  
**Hiyori:** Nothing; I just completely forgot\.\.\. Mai was going on a date with somebody, wasn't she\.  
**Kanami:** Oh right, we talked about that\.  
**Hiyori:** You know who it was, right\?  
**Kanami:** Why me\?  
**Hiyori:** I didn't notice at the time, but\.\.\. Your reaction back then showed you knew\.  
**Hiyori:** Was it with Sayaka\?  
**Kanami:** So you get curious about this kind of thing too, Hiyori-chan\?  
**Hiyori:** Urgh\.\.\. What's wrong with getting curious\!\? It's not like I wouldn't be interested\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** Ahaha, sorry\.  
**Kanami:** Anyway, it wasn't a date\. We just made plans to go have a picnic that day\.  
**Hiyori:** It was with you\?  
**Hiyori:** Wait, that's right\.\.\. So she made those natto onigiri for you\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** Those were really tasty, weren't they\!  
**Hiyori:** Yeah, they were good enough that I'd had three or four before I knew it\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** Still, that clears up the whole mystery\.  
**Kanami:** I wouldn't call it enough to be a mystery\.\.\. Oh, Hiyori-chan, the rain must've stopped at some point\.  
**Hiyori:** Nn\? Ahh, you're right\. Okay, let's go\.  
**Kanami:** Sure\.\.\. Ah\!\? Look at that\!\!  
https://streamable.com/zxsaxd

  

## [Summer Uniform - Hiyori: End\]: Summer's Coming
**Kanami:** Look, Hiyori-chan\! There's a big rainbow\!  
**Hiyori:** We saw a pretty rainbow then too\.\.\. But this one's beautiful all the same\.  
**Hiyori:** Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet\.\.\. Isn't it rare to see one where all seven colors are that clear\?  
**Kanami:** I'm gonna take a picture and show it to everyone\!  
**Hiyori:** Though you know\.\.\. As soon as the rain stopped, you can feel the temperature going up\.  
**Kanami:** Summer's just about here\. Ah, Mai-chan and Setouchi-san messaged me back\!  
**Hiyori:** That fast\!\? \.\.\.What'd they say\?  
**Kanami:** They wished we could see it together\.  
**Kanami:** And also, how long will we take shopping\.  
**Hiyori:** Tell them we were taking cover from the rain, so it'll be a while longer\.  
**Kanami:** Okay\! \.\.\.I sent it\.  
**Kanami:** Ahh\!\?  
**Hiyori:** What now\!\?  
**Kanami:** They said they're cooking something new for picnics, and they want us to taste test it when we get back\!  
**Hiyori:** Those two are cooking up something new, huh\.\.\. I can't wait to try it\.  
**Kanami:** Eating outside would make it a whole extra level tastier, wouldn't it\.  
**Kanami:** Ah, since we have time, it'd be nice to go camping too and not just picnicking\!  
**Hiyori:** Camping, huh\. It would sure feel like summer\.  
**Kanami:** Then we could do a test of courage\.\.\. Ah, fireworks would be good too\!  
**Hiyori:** It sounds like fun, but\.\.\. If we're doing that, wouldn't we have to look for a different location\?  
**Kanami:** Ah, you're right; if we camp there it seems like there'd be too many bugs\.  
**Hiyori:** Yeah\. It's not that we couldn't do it, but I'm sure we could find a better place to camp\.  
**Hiyori:** And also\.\.\. The rainy season only just stopped\. It'd be good to set camping aside and come up with plans\.  
**Kanami:** Good idea\! Since it's the summer season, I want to go with everyone to see the sea or a festival\!  
**Hiyori:** The sea\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** (I'd have to bring a swimsuit for that, wouldn't I\.\.\. Kh\!\)  
**Kanami:** Hiyori-chan\?  
**Hiyori:** Ah, no, it's nothing\.  
**Hiyori:** You're right\.\.\. The sea would be good too, wouldn't it\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** Yeah it would\!  
**Hiyori:** Heh\. Seems like this year's going to be another hot summer\.\.\.

## [Yukata - Kaoru: Start\]: Let's Test Our Courage\!
**Ellen:** Alright then, let's get this test of courage underway\! We made lots to draw, so everyone take turns drawing them and pair up\!  
**Yui:** Guhehehe, I can't wait to go\.  
**Kiyoka:** I just hope I'm together with Kofuki-san\.\.\. Ah, mine's number 3\.  
**Kofuki:** It's not like it matters who you end up with\. Uhh, number 5\.  
**Yui:** Fufufu, Kiyoka-chan, mine's number 3\.  
**Kiyoka:** Eeeek\.\.\.\!  
**Kaoru:** You guys sure are getting excited before we've even started-\.  
**Kaoru:** I was wondering why you called us out here this late, but why're we doing a test of courage all of a sudden\?  
**Ellen:** On summer nights, you've got to do a test of courage\!  
**Kaoru:** No way; that's when you sit in an air conditioned room sipping juice watching night games of baseball\.  
**Ellen:** Don't be like that, Kaoru\! Draw a lot\!  
**Kaoru:** Fine then\.\.\. Nn, number 1\.  
**Mihono:** Ah, I'm number 1, Kaoru-san\!  
**Kaoru:** Guess we're together, Mihono\.  
**Ellen:** Is everyone paired up\? Now then, number 1, start us off\!  
**Mihono:** Hmhmhmm\~\.  
**Kaoru:** It's supposed to be a test of courage, so what're you humming for\? Aren't you scared\?  
**Mihono:** I come out in the mountains at night for missions and training and stuff, so there's no way it'd be scary\.  
**Kaoru:** (When she says it all matter of factly like that, it makes me want to scare her\.\.\.\)  
**Kaoru:** (\.\.\.Alright\.\)  
**Kaoru:** Then, since this is a test of courage and all, how about we tell ghost stories while we walk\?  
**Mihono:** Ghost stories\?  
**Mihono:** I'm fine with that, but\.\.\. There's not really any ghost stories I know off the top of my head\.  
**Kaoru:** Don't worry about it\. I've got the best ghost story to tell\.  
**Mihono:** Huh, you do\!\? What's it about\?  
**Kaoru:** (Kukuku, Mihono\. You won't be making that face for long\!\)  
**Kaoru:** Actually, this one's about where we're walking right now\.  
**Mihono:** Okay\.  
**Kaoru:** This place used to be a graveyard\.  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.\.\.\.Eh\?  
https://streamable.com/hfbgc9

  

## [Yukata - Kaoru: End\]: Tell Me You're Lying
**Mihono:** \.\.\.No way, there's no way there's a graveyard this far in the mountains\. You just came up with that now, right\?  
**Kaoru:** You'd think so, wouldn't you\?  
**Kaoru:** But, this is a true story\. If you think I'm lying, you can check with Ellen\.  
**Mihono:** You say that, but\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** (Maybe if I give one more push she'll buy it\? What's something good\.\.\. Oh\.\)  
**Kaoru:** See, look over there\. There's a Jizo statue, right\?		[Jizo is a deity that is a savior of souls and also a protector of travelers\. Statues are often found in graveyards, but also along roadsides\.\]  
**Kaoru:** That's a leftover from when this place was a graveyard\.  
**Mihono:** It's true\.\.\. Then, this place really is\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Eep\!\?  
**Kaoru:** (Though, I'm making all of it up\.\)  
**Kaoru:** There's a lot of paved roads up this mountain, see\? Those are trails they made way back to let people pay a visits to the graveyard here\.  
**Mihono:** Th-That makes sense\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** But, y'know, mountains come with a lot of trouble\. Like\.\.\. landslides and stuff\.  
**Mihono:** Th-Then\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** Yeah\. That's why they decided to move away from this graveyard\. There was this really bad landslide\.\.\. And, apparently, they couldn't even check on all the graves\.  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.[gulp\]\.  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.Which means, some might've been left buried\. Just under your feet right now, there could be a dead body\.  
**Mihono/Ellen:** GYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Kaoru:** Uwah\!\? What're you doing here, Ellen\!\!  
**Ellen:** I made a mistake\! I was planning on scaring you two, but I ended up screaming by accident\!  
**Ellen:** Anyway, Kaoru\! Because of you, I can't stay here anymore\!  
**Ellen:** So, let me go with you\!  
**Kaoru:** Guess I have to\.  
**Mihono:** By the way, Ellen-san\.  
**Ellen:** What is it\?  
**Mihono:** When we left, you were there to see us off, weren't you\? So how'd you get around ahead of us\?  
**Mihono:** W-Wait, Ellen-san\.\.\.\? She's gone\.\.\.\?  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.Maybe it was just a ghost borrowing the form of Ellen\.  
**Mihono:** UWAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH\!\! We're going back\! We're going back right now, Kaoru-san\!\!  
**Kaoru:** Quit yanking my arm\! That hurts\! I was just kidding; I was kidding about everything\!  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.Huh\? You were kidding\?  
**Kaoru:** Everything I said I made up\! Ellen probably just used jin'i too\.  
**Mihono:** You were\.\.\. That's going way too far for a prank\! When we get back, I'm complaining to Ellen-san\!  
**Ellen:** Welcome back\! How did the test of courage go\?  
**Mihono:** Don't ask me\! That was really mean, scaring us like that, Ellen-san\!  
**Ellen:** \.\.\.\? What are you talking about\? I was\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** Right here the whole time, you know\.\.\.\?  
**Kaoru:** Then, the Ellen back there was\.\.\.  
**Kaoru/Mihono:** HIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE\!\!
