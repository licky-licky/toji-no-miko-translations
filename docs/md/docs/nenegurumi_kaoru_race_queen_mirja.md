## [Nenegurumi - Kaoru: Start]: Let's Sell Nenegurumis
**Sana:** Oh, you're here, Kaoru\.  
**Kaoru:** You're the one who called me, right\? So, what'd you need\?  
**Kaoru:** You're not about to push another annoying mission on me, are you\?  
**Sana:** We've decided to start selling Nenegurumis\.  
**Kaoru:** Huhh\? What the heck's a \"Nenegurumi\"\?  
**Sana:** A Nene nuigurumi, so, Nenegurumi\.		[Nuigurumi are just stuffed toys/dolls, and I'm not punning around with the name]  
**Kaoru:** Just leaving it at that\!\?  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.So, what do need me for with these Nenegurumis\? You want to use Nene as a model\?  
**Sana:** No, we already went ahead and made them\. Here's one\.  
**Kaoru:** Whoa\!\?  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.I-It's not the real Nene\.\.\. right\? I-I thought it was for a sec\.\.\. It seriously looks just like him\.  
**Sana:** Kaoru, go and sell this\.  
**Kaoru:** Huhh\!\? Why do I have to do it\!\!  
**Sana:** It's not forever; just for a limited time\. You know the shopping mall\? We rented a store there\.  
**Kaoru:** Saying that doesn't make it any better\.\.\.  
**Sana:** I called in somebody else to help too\. So anyway, I'm counting on you, Kaoru\.  
**Kaoru:** Seriously\.\.\.\?  
**Fujikami Minaki:** Ooh, you're here, Kaorucchi\!  
**Kaoru:** Then you're the other person, Minaki\.  
**Minaki:** Sure am\! Glad to be here\!  
**Minaki:** \.\.\.So, what am I meant to be doing anyway\?  
**Kaoru:** Did that hag seriously leave all the explaining to me too\.\.\.\?  
**Kaoru:** Nenegurumis\.\.\. We're selling Nenegurumis\. This thing\.  
**Minaki:** That was just a doll\!\? No way; I thought it was the real one\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** She said to sell these, but that's asking the impossible, right\?  
**Minaki:** Won't these sell a whole lot\? It's cute\!  
**Kaoru:** If you want it, you have it\.  
**Minaki:** Really\!\?  
**Kaoru:** I've got the real one anyway-\.  
**Minaki:** Thanks a lot, Kaorucchi\! Let's sell a bunch\!  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.If we have to\.

The Nenegurumi Shop, 3 hours before opening\.

  
**Minaki:** Uwah-\!\? The Nenegurumis fell over-\!\! Y-You okay, Kaorucchi\!\?  
**Kaoru:** Fine, but\.\.\. For how big this store is, we've got way too few people\!  
**Kaoru:** Give us more to work with-\!  
**Minaki:** It's no use saying that now-\.  
**Minaki:** We might only have two people here to set up, but more should be here to help this afternoon, so let's stick it out\!  
**Kaoru:** Minaki\.\.\.  
**Minaki:** Kaorucchi\!  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.If there's more coming to help, couldn't we call them now\?  
**Minaki:** I thought I got you feeling motivated\!\?  
**Kaoru:** Nah, nah, there's no way I'd be\. Though, I'll try in my own way\.  
**Minaki:** Kaorucchi\.\.\.  
**Minaki:** (\.\.\.Huh\? Isn't she moving a little livelier than before\.\.\.\?\)  
**Minaki:** Ahaha, you just can't be honest, huh Kaorucchi\!  
The Nenegurumi Shop, 2 hours before opening\.

  
**Kaoru:** Alright, this display's just about done\. All that's left is this big Nenegurumi\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** Just big enough\.\.\. Yeah\. How's it feel\.\.\. Yep, nice and fluffy\.  
**Kaoru:** Ooph\.\.\. Ahhh\. Well what do ya know, so this is where they were keeping heaven\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.[snooze]\.  
The Nenegurumi Shop, 1 hour before opening\.

  
**Minaki:** Looks like we might actually make it in time for the opening, Kaorucchi\!  
**Minaki:** \.\.\.Kaorucchi\?  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.[snooze]\.  
**Minaki:** Kaorucchi, you look like the Nenegurumi's hugging you\. So heartwarming\.  
**Minaki:** \.\.\.Hey, wake up, Kaorucchi\!  I can't finish the displays by myself\!\?  
**Kaoru:** Mmmnnm\.\.\.  
**Minaki:** \.\.\.Kh\. I'd feel real bad waking her up, but\.\.\. I've gotta harden my heart\!  
**\?\?\?:** Wait just a moment (dess\)\!\!  
**Minaki:** Y-You're--\!\!  
The Nenegurumi Shop, now open\.

  
**Girl:** Mama, look-\! That girl's sleeping with the dolly-\!  
**Mama:** Well, would you look at that\.  
**Girl:** Buy me that doll-\!  
**Mama:** Goodness, if you need it that badly\.  
**Ellen:** Just as planned\! Kaoru and all her cuteness\.\.\. she makes the perfect poster girl\!  
**Minaki:** Thanks, Ellencchi\~\! With you here, we made it safe in time for the store to open\~\!  
**Ellen:** You're welcome\! And, more importantly, before Kaoru wakes up, let's sell and sell till we're sold out\!

## [Race Queen - Mirja: Start]: A Favor
**Yui:** My intuition's telling me she should be around here\.\.\.  
**Yui:** Ah, found her\! Miiirja-saaan\~\!  
**Mirja:** Yamashiro Yui\? As well as\.\.\.  
**Morishita Kihiro:** Really-, we've been looking all over for you\! Miss Kitora\!  
**Haji Keiko:** H-Hello\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** Morishita Kihiro and Haji Keiko\. You three make a rare group\.  
**Kihiro:** You might be right there\!  
**Kihiro:** Though, despite myself coming from the equipment department and Miss Haji from the engineering preparatory department, we've long since deepened our friendship\!  
**Keiko:** Eh\!\?  
**Kihiro:** But you're right that we have little in common with Miss Yamashiro here\! \.\.\.What seems to be the matter, Miss Haji\?  
**Keiko:** I-It's\.\.\. nothing\.  
**Keiko:** (Deepened\.\.\. our friendship\.\.\.\?\)  
**Mirja:** So then, did you need me for something\?  
**Yui:** Yes\! Though, I'm not really the one looking for you; that's these two\!  
**Kihiro:** What are you saying, Miss Yamashiro\! With you offering your assistance, we're all of one heart and mind\!  
**Kihiro:** In short\! The three of us have one common cause\!  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.Haji Keiko, please give me the essentials\.  
**Keiko:** R-Right\.\.\. Actually, we were thinking we wanted you to help with our assignment, Kitora-san\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** Your assignment\?  
**Kihiro:** As a matter of fact, we've been assigned to build one motorcycle\!  
**Kihiro:** Soon enough, we'll be unveiling it to the public-- but as reasons go, we're lacking staff on that day\! We'd very much like your help, Miss Kitora\!  
**Mirja:** I'm not against helping you, but, sadly, I don't know much about motorcycles\.  
**Mirja:** Why not ask someone more suited for this\? Someone like Inago Akira should be up to the task\.  
**Yui:** Actually, we asked Boss, but she couldn't make it\.\.\.  
**Yui:** You're the only one we can turn to, Mirja-san\!  
**Yui:** And anyway, what we're missing is someone to help draw in visitors, so it's not like you even need to know about motorcycles\!  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**All 3:** Please help us\!  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.Fine then\. If you're that set on it, I'll help you out\.  
**Yui:** Hooray-\! This is why I love you, Mirja-san\!  
**Mirja:** Morishita Kihiro, Haji Keiko\. Could you give me a specific schedule for the event\?  
**Kihiro:** Sure thing\! We're glad to have you, Miss Kitora\! Really, what a stroke of luck, Miss Haji\!  
**Keiko:** Y-Yes\.\.\. But, err\.\.\. No, it is lucky\.\.\.  
**Kihiro:** We've done it, Miss Haji\! Now we're 100% prepared for the unveiling\!  
**Keiko:** Um, but\.\.\. Is this really okay\? I feel like we didn't tell her the important part\.\.\.  
**Yui:** Don't worry about it, Keiko-san\! We don't have to tell her about \"that\" until just before we start\!  
**Yui:** Mufufu\~\! Ahh\~, now I don't know how I'll wait for the day after tomorrow\~\!  
**Keiko:** (Is this really fine\.\.\.\?\)  

## [Race Queen - Mirja: End]: Day of the Unveiling
**Yui:** Mirja-san\! Can I be next to you on the way there\? You don't mind, right\!  
**Mirja:** Do what you want\.  
**Mirja:** More importantly, Morishita Kihiro\. Let's go over once more what will happen when we get there\.  
**Mirja:** Firstly, as I'm in charge of reaching out to visitors\.\.\.  
**Kihiro:** Ahh, we lied about that\.  
**Mirja:** Huh\?  
**Yui:** Hey\!\? It's too soon to spill the beans\!\!  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.Too soon to spill the beans\. And what do you mean by that, Yamashiro Yui\?  
**Yui:** Well, uh, we didn't lie so much, Mirja-san\. Loosely speaking, we do want you attracting visitors\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** Haji Keiko\?  
**Keiko:** M-Me\!\?  
**Kihiro:** Please don't glare at Miss Haji like that, Miss Kitora\. She was saying we should give a proper explanation until the bitter end\.  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.Right, I think I have an idea of what's going on\. Yamashiro Yui is behind this, isn't she\?  
**Yui:** Teheh\.  
**Mirja:** \"Teheh\" doesn't make up for this\.  
**Kihiro:** To give a perfectly crisp and clear explanation, we'd like you to be a race queen for us, Miss Kitora\!  
**Mirja:** A\.\.\. race queen\.  
**Mirja:** So, what are you making me wear\?  
**Yui:** Ehehe\! Take a look, Mirja-san\! This is it\!  
**Mirja:** To sum it up\.\.\. I wear this, sit on the motorcycle, and attract people\.\.\.  
**Kihiro:** As a staff member attracting visitors in the broadest sense, you're our billboard\.  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.  
**Keiko:** I-I'm sorry\.\.\. We were actually going to hire a professional to do this\.\.\.  
**Kihiro:** You see, while building the motorcycle, my gen\~ius instincts went and caught fire\.  
**Kihiro:** And, while remodeling here and there, we completely spent through our budget\.  
**Yui:** That's when I happened to hear about all this, and thought, why not ask Mirja-san\?  
**Yui:** With your bombshell body, there's no way you wouldn't look great in it\!  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.Unbelievable\.  
**Keiko:** Um\.\.\. Are you not going to do it afer all\.\.\.\?  
**Mirja:** No, I will\. I wouldn't turn you down after coming this far\. I'm not happy about it, but all I can do is resign myself to this\.\.\.  
**Cameraman:** Excuse me-\. Would you mind giving a look over this way-\?  
**Mirja:** Li\.\.\. like this\?  
**Cameraman:** Thanks a lot\! That's perfect\!  
**Man:** Hey, check out the cowling on that bike\.\.\.\! The design, materials, functionality; they're all first rate\.  
**Woman:** I can tell\. And, the parts used here\.\.\.\! That's an interesting make, but what purpose does it serve\? Hmm, I'd really like to find out\.  
**Kihiro:** Mmhm\! Just as we'd planned, Miss Haji\! Our motorcycle is the center of attention\!  
**Kihiro:** Now then\! Let's hurry over and give our guests an explanation\!  
**Keiko:** Right\.\.\.\! I'm very glad, that we worked so hard on this assignment\.\.\.\!  
Mirja： (\.\.\.From the sound of it, this motorcycle has incredible workmanship\. That at least makes it worth me enduring the shame of dressing as a race queen\.\)

  
**Mirja:** (Though--\)  
**Yui:** Hey, Mirja-saan\~\! Could you look over my way too\~\! And be extra sexy for me, please\~\!  
**Mirja:** (Sigh\.\.\. Instead of guiding visitors, Yamashiro Yui is just enjoying herself\. I'll have to lecture her thoroughly later\.\.\.\)
