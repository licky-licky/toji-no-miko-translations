## [Misogi- Mai: Start\]: My First Shock
--After being accepted to Minoseki Academy\.

  
**Minoseki Academy Teacher:** Alright, this might be your first swordfighting lesson after entering Minoseki Academy, but\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** I know\! I'm really excited for it\!  
**Mai:** (That girl, her name was\.\.\. Etou-san, wasn't it\? So she was looking forward to our swordfighting lessons that much\.\.\.\)  
**Minoseki Academy Teacher:** Looks like we've got a lively one with us\. To start us off, we'll have you learn what your classmates are capable of\.  
**Minoseki Academy Teacher:** You'll be fighting against everyone\.\.\. But first, pair up with the person next to you\!  
**Kanami:** I'll be in your care, Yanase-san\!  
**Mai:** S-Sure, likewise\.  
**Mai:** (We'll have to fight each of our classmates\? Which would mean, I'll have to think about how to conserve my energy\.\.\.\)  
**Minoseki Academy Teacher:** Now then\.\.\. Begin\!  
**Kanami:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Mai:** (Wait, she's not attacking\?\)  
**Mai:** (That's sort of a let-down\. With how she was acting, I thought she'd come straight at me as soon as we began\.\.\.\)  
**Kanami:** I'm ready anytime\.  
**Mai:** (Her stance is\.\.\. Seigan\. It's so orthodox that there doesn't seem to be any scheme behind it\. There's no need for tricks like that in our very first lesson anyway\.\)  
**Mai:** (In which case\.\.\. I'll go\!\)  
**Mai:** YAAAAH\!  
**Kanami:** -\!  
**Mai:** \.\.\.Eh\!\?  
**Mai:** (She dodged it\.\.\. And so easily too\.\.\.\)  
**Kanami:** There's hardly any wasted movements\.\.\. You love swordfighting too, don't you, Yanase-san\!  
**Kanami:** Show me more of your swordsmanship\!  
**Minoseki Academy Teacher:** That's enough\!  
**Mai:** Pant, pant\.\.\.  
**Mai:** (I wasn't any match for her at all\.\.\. Etou-san, just who are you\.\.\.\)  
**Kanami:** Yanase-san, you're so strong\!  
**Mai:** You too, Etou-san\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** Just call me Kanami\!  
**Mai:** (There's somebody\.\.\. This amazing here\.\.\. Etou\.\.\. Kanami\.\.\.\)  
**Mai:** Kanami-chan\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** Yeah, Mai-chan\!  
**Mai:** -\!  
**Mai:** Etou\.\.\. Kanami-chan\.\.\.  
**Friend A:** Mai's been together with Kanami all the time lately, hasn't she\?  
**Mai:** \.\.\.Eh\?  
**Friend B:** Ah, I was thinking the same thing\. Ever since that swordfighting lesson, right\?  
**Friend A:** Well, Kanami was pretty amazing\.  
**Mai:** Th-That's only because\.\.\. See, Kanami-chan may be strong, but, don't you think she's unsafe in some ways\? Like, she might prioritize swordfighting over her own well being\.\.\.  
**Friend B:** You say that, but isn't the truth that you just wound up having a crush on her\?  
**Mai:** I do not\!\! Don't go making assumptions like that\!\!  

## [Misogi- Mai: End\]: The Name of This Feeling is Admiration
**Friend A:** Eh, Mai\.\.\.\?  
**Mai:** I-I'm sorry\! There's something the teacher asked me to take care of\!  
**Kanami:** \.\.\.  
**Mai:** \.\.\.Sigh\.  
**Mai:** (Why did I get so upset when she said that\.\.\. I'd better\.\.\. apologize to her, shouldn't I\.\.\.\)  
**Mai:** (But\.\.\. I don't understand it myself, why I reacted like that\.\.\. I could tell right away she was only joking\.\.\.\)  
**Mai:** But, Kanami-chan\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** You called\?  
**Mai:** K-Kanami-chan\!\? Why are you\.\.\.\?  
**Kanami:** Actually\.\.\. I saw what happened before\. And then, I followed you here\.  
**Kanami:** If it's alright with you, you can talk it over with me, okay\?  
**Mai:** \.\.\.Thank you, Kanami-chan\.  
**Kanami:** Why'd you get so mad\? Can I ask you that\?  
**Mai:** That's because\.\.\.  
**Mai:** (I can't exactly tell her it's because they asked if I liked you, can I\.\.\.\)  
**Mai:** It was my fault\. They were only teasing me a little, but I got seriously upset\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** \.\.\.Was it because, they made fun of something important to you\?  
**Mai:** Eh\?  
**Kanami:** When I think, \"If it were me, what would I get mad if someone made fun of\?\", it's got to be swordfighting of course\!  
**Mai:** Fufu, I could see that, Kanami-chan\.  
**Mai:** (But then\.\.\. That means, I got upset because Kanami-chan is important to me\?\)  
**Kanami:** And also\.\.\. If somebody made fun of somebody you respect, you'd feel bad too, wouldn't you\?  
**Mai:** Someone you respect\.\.\. Yeah, respect\! That's it, Kanami-chan\!  
**Mai:** Thank you for letting me talk this over with you\!  
**Kanami:** Sure\! Wait, huh\? Thinking back, I feel like I was the one doing all the talking\.\.\.  
**Mai:** Still, that's fine\! I'm going to go apologize to them\!  
**Mai:** I'm sorry\!  
**Friend A:** No, we're the ones who should be saying sorry\. We were being sort of insensitive\.  
**Friend B:** We were\. But, I didn't think that you actually did like Kanami\.\.\. We'll do what we can to support you two, Mai\!  
**Mai:** Eh\!\? Th-That's not it\! You misunderstand\!  
**Friend A:** \.\.\.It's not\?  
**Mai:** That's right\. Kanami-chan, she's the first opponent I didn't think I could beat in swordfighting, so I respect her a lot\.  
**Mai:** But, when you teased me about it\.\.\. I think that's why I couldn't help but get angry all of a sudden\.  
**Friend A:** So that's what it was\. It happens, huh\.  
**Mai:** We might be the same age, but\.\.\. Kanami-chan was just so much stronger\. That's why\.\.\. Someday, I'd like to be about as strong as Kanami-chan\.  
**Friend B:** She definitely is\. We'll have to work real hard ourselves-\.  
**Mai:** Mmhm\! Let's all work hard enough that we won't lose to Kanami-chan\!

## [Dress - Mai: Start\]: Nene's Madness
**Kaoru:** Gulp, gulp, gulp\.\.\. Phwaa\! Gimme another glass of grape juice\!  
**Nene:** Ne-\!  
**Mai:** Kaoru-chan, I think you've had enough grape juice\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** Don't stop me\! Cause you know, there's a life of taking the overnight bus north to south and back waiting for me ahead\!  
**Kaoru:** How'm I supposed to get through that without drinking this\!  
**Nene:** Nene\!  
**Mai:** Still\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** Hey, Mai\.\.\. Have you ever rode on an overnight bus\?  
**Mai:** I haven't\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** See\? It's a place where you can never get a good sleep, you'll get woken up at every service area, your strength gets worn down hour after hour\.\.\.  
**Mai:** Kaoru-chan\.\.\. Are you drunk\?  
**Kaoru:** Who gets drunk off grape juice\! But I can't make it if I don't drink\!  
**Mai:** I-I see\.  
**Kaoru:** Ahh\.\.\. It's good\.  
**Kaoru:** This big piece of chicken too, and that roast beef I had before, they used some pretty high grade meat, right\?  
**Nene:** Ne-\?  
**Kaoru:** Nn\? Nene, you want this meat\? You can't, it's mine\.  
**Nene:** Ne\!  
**Kaoru:** I'm the one who got it, so it's my meat\!  
**Nene:** Ne-\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** Anyway, that dress looks good on you, Mai\.  
**Mai:** Thank you, Kaoru-chan\. You look good in yours too\.  
**Kaoru:** What, this\? They didn't have many dresses in my size, y'know-\.  
**Mai:** They didn't\?  
**Kaoru:** Yeah\. They had a whole bunch in the size just above mine though\.  
**Nene:** NE--------\!  
**Mai:** Kyaa\!  
**Kaoru:** Nene stole my meat\!\?  
**Nene:** Ne\!  
**Kaoru:** Stop it, Nene\! That's my meat\!  

## [Dress - Mai: End\]: Dress Close Call
**Kaoru:** Hey\! Gimme my meat back\!  
**Nene:** Ne-\?  
**Mai:** K-Kaoru-chan, it's not that important\.\.\.  
**Mai:** Ah, could you tell me which table you got that from\? I'll get some more for you\.  
**Kaoru:** That's not gonna work\! That was the last of the meat there\!  
**Mai:** Oh dear-\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** And Nene, he knew that, and he still went after my meat\!  
**Nene:** Nene-\!  
**Mai:** S-Still, if you want meat, there's plenty of other kinds laid out\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** But that's the last of that kind of meat\!  
**Mai:** Ah\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** Kukuku, I've got you cornered now, Nene\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** Okay, time to choose\. You gonna give my meat back\.\.\. Or aren't you\? If you give it back now, I'll forgive you\.\.\.\?  
**Nene:** Nenenenenenenene\!  
**Kaoru:** Ah-\! You jackass, you ate it all in one go\!  
**Nene:** Ne\?  
**Mai:** I think it's a little late to be playing innocent, Nene\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** You're getting it now, Nene\!  
**Nene:** Ne-\!  
**Mai:** Kyaa\!  
**Kaoru:** You dumbass\! Don't go jumping at Mai\!  
**Nene:** Ne\!\?  
**Kaoru:** We're safe\.\.\. That was close\. You know better than that; if you'd jumped on her just after eating, you'd get her dress dirty\.  
**Nene:** Ne-\.\.\.  
**Mai:** Thank you\.\.\. Kaoru-chan\. Nene-chan, I'll wipe your mouth for you\.  
**Nene:** Ne-\!  
**Kaoru:** Can I leave Nene with you\? I'm going to go get some meat\.  
**Mai:** Sure, that's fine with me\.  
**Kaoru:** Then, I'm off\.\.\. This time, I'd better get some for Nene so he won't steal mine\.  
**Mai:** \.\.\.So she says\. Isn't that good for you, Nene-chan\?  
**Nene:** Ne\!
