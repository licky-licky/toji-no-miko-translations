## [VR Suit - Kanami: Start]: Trip to Unreality
**Tsugumi:** Etou-san, Itomi-san. Thank you for going out of your way to stop by the lab today.  
**Kanami:** What was it you wanted Sayaka-chan and me to do?  
**Tsugumi:** I'm actually working with a new game utilizing the VR technology in development here in the lab... And, we were looking for play testers.  
**Kanami:** A new game\!\? That sounds fun\! Don't you want to try it, Sayaka-chan?  
**Sayaka:** ...  
**Kanami:** Sayaka-chan? What's wrong? You don't look too happy.  
**Sayaka:** Tsugumi made that, didn't she... Kofuki said, "Watch out with stuff she's made"... Will it be alright?  
**Tsugumi:** It's true that a lot has happened with Shichinosato-san... But you don't need to worry, Kitora-san is working with me this time.  
**Tsugumi:** And we've proven it to be perfectly safe. We have provided a simple battle stage, but the primary goal of the game is to enjoy a virtual environment.  
**Kanami:** Enjoy a virtual environment? Does that mean you can do things like fly around and make friends with the locals?  
**Tsugumi:** That's right. We've put quite a lot of effort into the details on that end, so please look forward to it.  
**Tsugumi:** If you befriend the townspeople, they can provide you with food and sweets, and invite you to parties... We've included fun features like that.  
**Kanami:** Sounds fun\! Sayaka-chan, I want to try it out\!  
**Sayaka:** Mm... But, I'm fine with sweets in the real world...  
**Tsugumi:** Is that right. Incidentally, we've prepared a prize for the person that achieves the highest score in the game's battle stage.  
**Kanami:** A prize\!\? What do we get?  
**Tsugumi:** Kitora-san is out right now picking up cream puffs, but it seems she'll need to wait in line, as the store is fairly popular.  
**Sayaka:** Creme puffs from a store with a line... Kanami. I'll try it.  
**Kanami:** Nice-\! Then, we'll be in your care, Tsugumi-san.  
**Tsugumi:** Thank you for participating. Then, getting right to it, let's put on the equipment. And, I'll explain how to use it...  
**Kanami:** It sure has a lot of features\! It's giving me goosebumps. Alright, here I go-\!  
**Kanami:** Wow-- So cool\! Is this seriously the world inside the game? It looks like a real city-\!  
**Sayaka:** Mm, the city at night... It's really beautiful...  
**Kanami:** Wahh, look, look, Sayaka-chan\! I'm flying in the air\!  
**Sayaka:** I'll try it too... That's amazing... I can fly...  
**Kanami:** Give me your hand and we'll fly up to the top of that building\!  
**Sayaka:** Okay.  
**Kanami:** Whoa-\! We're flying between buildings like a couple of birds-\! It's like I'm dreaming\!  
**Sayaka:** Mm... This is fun. Ah... Someone is waving their arm from a window...  
**Kanami:** They are\! Evening-\! This is a really nice city you've got here-.  
**Sayaka:** It looks like they're saying something. What do you think it is?  
**Kanami:** Let's fly over next to the window then\!  
**Kanami:** Whoa\! There's a bunch of tasty looking cakes on the inside. Eh? You're giving us these, to welcome us? Lucky us, Sayaka-chan.  
**Sayaka:** Mm. Since we're here, we should try them.  
**Kanami:** I wonder what cakes in virtual reality taste like. We'll take you up on that right away...  
**Kanami:** Wait, that sound\! Something's wrong with the city\!  
**Sayaka:** Is this the battle stage Tsugumi talked about? I'll try my best, for everyone in the city and for the cream puffs.  
**Kanami:** Ughhh, that's right, but... There's all these good looking cakes right in front of us-\!

## [VR Suit - Kanami: End]: Clear Reward
**Kanami:** Whoa\! You can take down enemies with a laser gun. This is so fun\~\!  
**Sayaka:** Mm. Fighting without an okatana... It feels new.  
**Kanami:** You're really good at this, Sayaka-chan.  
**Sayaka:** You're good too, Kanami.  
**Kanami:** Do you think we cleared the battle stage? The townspeople who hid are coming back.  
**Sayaka:** That's good... We protected the people in this world too.  
**Kanami:** There's that person who was waving at us from the window earlier\! Heyyy\!  
**Townsperson:** Thank you very much for protecting our town. As thanks, we've prepared a feast for you, so please come with me.  
**Sayaka:** A feast?  
**Kanami:** Let's go, Sayaka-chan\!  
**Sayaka:** Amazing... There's an impressive feast...  
**Kanami:** Is it really okay for us to have all this?  
**Townsperson:** Of course\! You can have as much of the cakes you didn't get to eat earlier as you want too. Please, take your time.  
**Kanami:** If you say so, then I won't hold back. Let's dig in-\! [munch munch]... No way\! This is as tasty as real cake\!  
**Sayaka:** It really is. ...It's sweet and delicious.  
**Kanami:** Sayaka-chan, this steak and sushi here are good too\! It's hard to believe this is actually part of a game\!  
**Sayaka:** Mm, it's really delicious... I feel like I could eat this forever.  
**Kanami:** That's for sure. [chew chew] Mmmm, so good\! Can I have seconds, please-\!  
**Kanami:** Phew\~\. My stomach's so full I can't eat another bite\!  
**Sayaka:** Me too. I feel full. I want to bring some back for Mai and everyone.  
**Kanami:** Good idea\! Excuse me-, could we get this cake to go?  
**Kanami:** Hm? When that sound plays, does that mean the game's over? But the cake isn't boxed up yet-\!  
**Tsugumi:** Welcome back. How was the virtual world?  
**Kanami:** Tsugumi-san, that game was too cool\! It was sooo much fun, and the food was really tasty too\!  
**Sayaka:** We ate a lot, until we were full...... Hm?  
**Kanami:** Sayaka-chan? What's wrong?  
**Sayaka:** Even though I ate so much... I feel hungry...?  
**Kanami:** That's so weird; me too\! I was stuffing my mouth just a few minutes ago too-.  
**Tsugumi:** Everything you experienced in there was virtual, after all. When you return here, you'll be in the state you were in before you started.  
**Sayaka:** Is that why... It's strange, after I ate so much.  
**Kanami:** Ah, come to think of it, can we have those cream puffs? Sayaka-chan worked really hard beating the enemies.  
**Tsugumi:** Unfortunately, it seems that Kitora-san is still waiting in line. And also, those will only be given out as a prize to the top scorer after we get more people to play.  
**Kanami:** Oh, huh-.  
**Mai:** Sayaka-chan, Kanami-chan, there you are.  
**Kanami:** Mai-chan\! Why are you here?  
**Sayaka:** [sniff sniff]... I smell Mai's cookies.  
**Mai:** Fufufu, you got it right, Sayaka-chan. I baked some cookies and thought we could have them together, so I came to find you.  
**Kanami:** Yay-, I'm glad to hear it\! Who'd have thought Mai-chan would bring cookies at just the right time\! I'll have some-\!  
**Sayaka:** I'm glad too. Mai, I'll have some. [munch much]... They're tasty\!  
**Kanami:** Yeah, yeah\! The cake in the game was tasty too, but your cookies really are the tastiest after all, Mai-chan-\!

## [Xmas' 19 - Suzuka: Start]: A Place to Hide a Present
**Maki:** Suzuka, did something happen for you to call me over here?  
**Suzuka:** I'm sorry to do this when things are so busy at the end of the year. But actually, I'd like to discuss something with you.  
**Maki:** Discuss what?  
**Suzuka:** It's about the birthday present we bought for Yomi-san the other day.  
**Maki:** Oh yeah. We picked out a great present thanks to you. I'm looking forward to surprising her with it. But, what about it?  
**Suzuka:** You see, I had hidden it in the back of the record room so that Yomi-san wouldn't find it until the 24th...  
**Maki:** Don't tell me she found it\!\?  
**Suzuka:** No, I was able to retrieve it just in time, but Yomi-san' intuition is sharp. I'm not quite sure how to keep it a secret until the day of.  
**Maki:** I get it. You're right, that's an important discussion to have.  
**Suzuka:** To begin with, anywhere we can enter, Yomi-san freely enters as well...  
**Maki:** And if we kept it in our living quarters, Yume would likely find it whenever she comes in to play around.  
**Suzuka:** In previous years, we prepared it together with Yume, so the three of us could have kept it a secret between us.  
**Maki:** But she went and said she'd do something on her own this year. I want to keep it secret from Yume too if possible...  
**Yomi:** Konohana-san, you were in here?  
**Suzuka:** Y-Yomi-san\! Hadn't you gone off on an assignment?  
**Yomi:** I was called in by Yukari-sama. I'm supposed to bring you with me as well.  
**Suzuka:** Yukari-sama asked for you and myself? Very well then. We can leave in a moment. Though...  
**Maki:** I'll take care of the present for now. If you think of a good place to store it, send me a message.  
**Suzuka:** Alright then. Do your best to keep it a secret.  
**Yukari:** Konohana, Satsuki, the two of you will be undertaking a special mission.  
**Suzuka:** I understand. Ask us to do whatever is needed.  
**Yomi:** Yes, whatever the mission entails, we will carry it out flawlessly.  
**Yukari:** Those are encouraging responses. Your mission is set to take place on December 25th.  
**Yukari:** Dressed in Santa Claus outfits, I want you to visit locations where the local children gather and distribute presents prepared by the Origami family.  
**Suzuka/Yomi:** Eh...?  
**Yukari:** What, are you dissatisfied with that?  
**Suzuka:** Not at all; I think it's a wonderful idea\! Yukari-sama, thank you for offering us this lovely mission.  
**Yomi:** So long as you order it, I'll tend to it quickly, Yukari-sama.  
**Yukari:** The presents have already been set aside in the storehouse. I leave it to you to decide how to distribute them. Is that clear?  
**Suzuka:** Yes ma'am\!  
**Yomi:** There's a mountain of presents...  
**Suzuka:** Would you look at that\! Each of them is so neatly wrapped; just the sight of it gives me a thrill\!  
**Yomi:** Does it...  
**Suzuka:** They're all so cute, and yet you don't seem interested in the slightest, Yomi-san...  
**Suzuka:** Ahh\! That's right\! I could try that\!  
**Yomi:** Konohana-san? Is something wrong?  
**Suzuka:** (Fufu, I've come up with an excellent idea of how to hide Yomi-san's present.)

## [Xmas' 19 - Suzuka: End]: Present For You
December 25th.

  
**Suzuka:** Merry Christmas, to all you good girls and boys\! These are presents from the Origami family. Please, come right up and have one\~\.  
**Boy 1:** Ehh-\! Can I really have one?  
**Child's Mother:** Thank you very much.  
**Boy 2:** Santa-onee-san\! Please give me a present too\!  
**Girl 1:** Me too-\!  
**Suzuka:** Oh my, we're completely surrounded by children now. Yomi-san, are you alright over there?  
**Yomi:** .........  
**Yomi:** Will all the children please calm down. Plenty of presents have been prepared. They will be distributed as quickly as we are able, so please form a line and stand silently for your turn.  
**Suzuka:** Yomi-san\! If you use such difficult words, you won't get through to them.  
**Yomi:** I'm sorry. I'm unused to working with children...  
**Suzuka:** There's no helping that then. Yomi-san, I'll give an example of what to do, so try mimicking me to start. Here I go.  
**Suzuka:** If any of our little friends would like a present, please line up in front of us onee-sans\~\!  
**Children:** Okaaay\!  
**Yomi:** I see, bring yourself down to their level, and speak plainly to them... I'll try it.  
**Yomi:** Everyone, if you want a present, please line up. Will everyone who wants a present please line up.  
**Suzuka:** All the presents were peacefully handed out. You did well, Yomi-san.  
**Yomi:** ......  
**Suzuka:** Are you feeling too tired to have much to say? Though, because of your efforts today, you brought happiness to plenty of children.  
**Yomi:** Do you think so?  
**Suzuka:** I do. And that Santa bag you're holding is the proof of it. Isn't the inside filled with objects of their gratitude?  
**Yomi:** Yes; letters, drawings, candies, and chocolate. I never expected them to give me so many gifts in return.  
**Suzuka:** With this, we should be able to give a good report to Yukari-sama.  
**Yomi:** That's true.  
**Yomi:** By the way, Konohana-san. You've been carefully holding onto one present for a while now. Did you forget to distribute it?  
**Yomi:** Our mission today was to deliver every last one of the presents. We should hurry and find a child to deliver it to.  
**Suzuka:** There won't be any need for that. This here is Maki-san and my birthday present to you, Yomi-san.  
**Yomi:** For... me?  
**Suzuka:** With all the confusion surrounding the party and our missions, we ended up a day late, but Yomi-san, we wish you a happy birthday.  
**Yomi:** Konohana-san...  
**Suzuka:** Fufu, and I'll take a photo of the moment of our successful surprise. Maki-san on her expedition assignment should be glad to see this.  
**Yomi:** Thank you for your gift. I'm grateful for your thoughtfulness.  
**Suzuka:** You're very perceptive, Yomi-san, so we were anxious you might find your present before we could give it to you.  
**Suzuka:** We were very lucky to keep it a secret until today. I suppose you hide a tree in a forest, and a present among gifts.

## [Dress 20 - Akira: Start]: No Way I'd Be Late
**Yomi:** Akira.  
**Akira:** Nn? Ahh, there you are, Yomi. It's not often you're the one calling me up.  
**Yomi:** Yukari-sama will be hosting a recognition party for the Miss Five Traditions event.  
**Yomi:** Please be there, Akira.  
**Akira:** Sure, I got it.  
**Yomi:** And please try not to be late this time either.  
**Akira:** Oi oi, I might show up late a lot, but that doesn't mean I'm gonna be late all the time, alright?  
**Yomi:** ...I hope I can hold you to that. I've made sure to let you know.  
The day of the party.

  
**Akira:** Why'd I have to get a suppression mission today of all days\!\?  
**Fukuda Sawano:** The aradama are on the move, Inago-san\!  
**Akira:** ORAA\!  
**Aradama:** UOOOO...  
**Sawano:** If nothing else, you at least know how to handle yourself, Inago-san.  
**Akira:** Huh? What's that supposed to mean?  
**Sawano:** No, nothing at all.  
**Sawano:** At any rate, I'm glad you're here. Who'd have thought...  
**Sawano:** Such a large aradama outbreak would happen.  
**Akira:** Tch. And just when I was thinking I'd made it to school on time for once\!  
**Akira:** Oi, you mind if I just do my own thing here? I've got somewhere to be after this\!  
**Sawano:** Ordinarily I'd say we can't manage, but... Fine. We'll do what we can to support you.  
**Akira:** Sorry. I'll pay you back for this soon enough.  
**Sawano:** Please deal with the aradama. That would be plenty.  
**Akira:** Count on me\!  
**Akira:** That's finally over with\!  
**Akira:** But, look how late it got... There's no way I'm making it on time.  
**Akira:** What's Yomi gonna say...  
**Sawano:** Thank you very much for today, Inago-san.  
**Sawano:** Especially for helping us on the day of the Miss Five Traditions recognition party.  
**Akira:** There's no getting out of it when it's my mission. Seeya around, Sawano.  
**Sawano:** Ah.  
**Sawano:** Inago-san... So she remembered my name.

## [Dress 20 - Akira: End]: Grape Juice
**Akira:** Phew, made it.  
**Yomi:** As late as usual.  
**Akira:** Geh, Yomi\!\?  
**Yomi:** Even after I made such a point of warning you, you still couldn't be here on time.  
**Akira:** What was I supposed to do\! I mean, I went to school like normal too\!  
**Akira:** But then I got sent on this mission all of a sudden, and up till now I was way out in the mountains suppressing aradama\!  
**Yomi:** That sounds like something you would do. Don't you think you could have refused, just for today?  
**Akira:** Huh? Between a mission and a party, 'course I'd deal with the mission first. What're you talking about?  
**Yomi:** ...That is very like you.  
**Yomi:** There's a dress ready for you. Please come inside.  
**Akira:** Alright, and sorry 'bout this.  
**Sana:** Well look at that, now there's someone I don't see too often.  
**Akira:** It's been a while, huh, President Sana.  
**Akira:** ...Ah.  
**Sana:** What is it?  
**Akira:** Your glass's empty, right? I'll fill it up for you.  
**Sana:** That's not alcohol you're holding there, is it?  
**Akira:** What, this? It's grape juice. See?  
**Sana:** ......You're right, that's definitely grape juice.  
**Akira:** I am still a minor and all. This grape juice's pretty good too.  
**Sana:** I think I heard we got it in from a winery.  
**Akira:** No wonder it's good then.  
**Sana:** Inago, how have things been on your end lately?  
**Akira:** On what end?  
**Sana:** You haven't been showing your face around Mokusa, have you?  
**Akira:** Things've been a little busy in our faction since the leader changed.  
**Sana:** ...Her, hm.  
**Akira:** Yeah. ...I've gotta do what I can to back her up.  
**Sana:** ...I see. Don't get in over your head at least.  
**Akira:** Not much I can do about that. What kinda friend wouldn't go to crazy lengths for them?  
**Sana:** If I were talking to Kaoru, she'd be glad hearing me say to slack off. But I guess this is your answer.  
**Sana:** Well, enjoy yourself today.  
**Akira:** Yeah. I'll take you up on that.

## [Summer Uniform 20 - Tsugumi: Start]:
**Tsugumi:** We'll be... cleaning the pool?  
**Yomi:** Yes. President Takatsu ordered us "to clean it up."  
**Tsugumi:** Roger that-.  
**Tsugumi:** Though, it's going to be hard work if it's only the two of us. We should try reaching out to people we know.  
**Yomi:** Yes, please do.  
**Tsugumi:** Now, I said I would reach out to people, but I really don't know that many, do I-.  
**Tsugumi:** To start... Let's go with her.  
**Tsugumi:** Shichinosato-san.  
**Kofuki:** Huh? That's weird; you never come out here.  
**Tsugumi:** We'll be cleaning the pool after school tomorrow. There's no ifs, ands, or buts, so I'll see you there.  
**Tsugumi:** And please inform the rest of the investigation team for me, okay-.  
**Kofuki:** Twist my arm, why don't you\!  
**Tsugumi:** Next is...  
**Sayaka:** Tsugumi?  
**Tsugumi:** Ahh, good. You were here, Itomi-san.  
**Sayaka:** What do you need?  
**Tsugumi:** Actually, tomorrow, we'll be cleaning the pool. If you want, would you join us too?  
**Sayaka:** Cleaning the pool... Can I?  
**Tsugumi:** Of course you can.  
**Tsugumi:** Oh, and, after the cleaning is over, I think we'll be able to play around for a while.  
**Tsugumi:** Why not bring Yanase-san and the others along?  
**Sayaka:** Mm, okay. I'll ask them.  
**Tsugumi:** Right, that would be great.  
**Tsugumi:** I managed to ask the most noteable people to come, but, as for others...  
**Suu:** I don't have to do any more missions, or training, or the utsushi increasing program this week\! Hopefully every day gets to be like this\!  
**Tsugumi:** ......  
**Tsugumi:** Inami-san.  
**Suu:** GYAAAAAAAA\!\?  
**Suu:** ...Wait, Ban-san?  
**Tsugumi:** I overheard you speaking to yourself... Are you available tomorrow?  
**Suu:** Y-Yeah... I guess.  
**Tsugumi:** In that case, would you help us clean the pool? We'll be in trouble if we can't get more to help out.  
**Suu:** Cleaning the pool? If that's all, then...  
**Tsugumi:** I'm glad to hear it. Ah, by the way, the others joining us will be Shichinosato-san, Itomi-san, and Satsuki-san.  
**Suu:** Huh?  
**Tsugumi:** Then, I'll see you tomorrow.  
**Suu:** You didn't tell me they'd be there though\!\?  
**Tsugumi:** I spread the word for now, but... How many will actually be there?  
**Tsugumi:** I'll have to wait and see tomorrow.  

## [Summer Uniform 20 - Tsugumi: End]:
The day of the pool cleaning.

  
**Tsugumi:** Now then, let's begin cleaning the pool.  
**Akira:** Let's get to it, Tsugumi.  
**Akira:** Though, why's it just the two of us anyway? Yomi's the one who told me and she's not even here.  
**Tsugumi:** I was told she would be coming slightly later, along with the people I asked to come.  
**Tsugumi:** For the time being, you and I should proceed with the cleaning.  
**Akira:** Sure thing\!  
**Akira:** We'll get a lead on 'em before they show up\!  
**Tsugumi:** (How exactly do you get a lead on someone in cleaning a pool...?\)  
**Akira:** Hahahahahaha\! Bring on the hose\!  
**Akira:** I'm gonna keep raining down water, so keep up\!  
**Tsugumi:** Right. Then, I'll brush off the grime at the bottom.  
**Kanami:** Hey, they've already gotten started\!  
**Yui:** Ah, Boss's spraying water around\! Lucky\! I want to try it too\! I'll get Kiyoka-chan all wet\!  
**Kiyoka:** Why me\!\?  
**Mihono:** I'll help you out, Akira-san\!  
**Akira:** Sure, bring it on\! Let's get this started\!  
**Mai:** I guess we'll take care of the mopping?  
**Sayaka:** Mm.  
**Kaoru:** Do you actually need us here after all?  
**Ellen:** Don't be like that\! This looks fun, Kaoru\!  
**Ellen:** Inagooon\! We're helping you toooo\!  
**Suu:** S-Sorry I'm late... Ah\! Kanami-san\!  
**Kanami:** Oh, Suu-chan\! Did you already see this week's Marvelous-chan\!\?  
**Suu:** Of course I did\!  
**Akira:** Look at them all pouring in. Just how many people'd you invite?  
**Tsugumi:** I only asked three people to come...  
**Tsugumi:** (Shichinosato-san isn't here, is she. So she ran away.)  
**Akira:** You don't seem like it, but you're a real people person. Pretty good.  
**Tsugumi:** I'm not; let's just leave that aside and finish cleaning the pool.  
**Akira:** ...You're tough to get a handle on, y'know.

## [Renpu Summer Uniform - Yomi: Start]: Yomi and Akira
**Yomi:** I thought then that, someday, I wanted to be helpful to that person.  
**Akira:** ...  
**Yomi:** Sorry I made you wait. It's been a while, Akira.  
**Akira:** ...  
**Yomi:** What's wrong?  
**Akira:** Your hair... So what I heard's true after all...  
**Yomi:** Word reached you quickly then.  
**Akira:** Who gives a shit about that\! Are you... Are you seriously okay with this\!\?  
**Yomi:** I am.  
**Akira:** --\!  
**Akira:** ...You're so goddamn stupid. You're gonna make auntie cry, y'know?  
**Yomi:** ...  
**Akira:** So say something\!  
**Yomi:** ...This has nothing to do with you.  
**Yomi:** Aside from that, don't say a word about the Myouga project to anyone. Please tell that to Hitakami-san as well.  
**Akira:** ...It's not like I was planning on spilling the beans or anything.  
**Akira:** I was just... I just came here to see if you were actually this dumb.  
**Yomi:** Is that so.  
**Akira:** ...At least talk to me about these things.  
**Yomi:** Even if I did, there would be no point to it.  
**Akira:** Even if there's no point, you can still talk\! We're buddies, aren't we\!\?  
**Yomi:** ...  
**Akira:** Say something, damnit\!  
**Yomi:** I figured you would be angry with me.  
**Akira:** You're so damn...\!  
**Akira:** ...Fine, I'm not gonna say another word about it\! I just don't get it, is all\!  
**Yomi:** ...I did just tell you not to say anything.  
**Akira:** Shut up, dumbass\!  
**Yomi:** I don't want to hear you keep insulting me.  
**Yomi:** I only did this because this was the only means for me to be useful to her.  
**Akira:** ...I sort of get where you're coming from, but still...  
**Akira:** ......  
**Akira:** ...I'm going back\! Don't go too far with it, alright\!  
**Yomi:** ...  
**Yomi:** ...That's something I can't promise.  

## [Renpu Summer Uniform - Yomi: End]: Someday
**Tsugumi:** Preparations for the experiment are finished.  
**Yukina:** You've done well.  
**Yukina:** Though, from here on the details of the experiment are highly classified. You need to leave.  
**Tsugumi:** ...  
**Yukina:** Yomi, ready yourself\!  
**Yomi:** Yes ma'am.  
**Tsugumi:** Satsuki-san.  
**Yomi:** ...  
**Tsugumi:** Please be careful.  
**Tsugumi:** I prepared everything as I was told, but these aradama are dangerous.  
**Yomi:** That won't be a problem.  
**Tsugumi:** I see. Then, I'll be leaving now.  
**Yukina:** Has she gone?  
**Yukina:** Then, begin the experiment\!  
**Yomi:** HAAAAAHH\!\!  
**Aradama:** OOOOOOO\!  
**Yomi:** Kgh\!\?  
**Yukina:** What do you think you're doing\! You shouldn't be struggling against an aradama this weak\!  
**Yomi:** Yes ma'am\!
