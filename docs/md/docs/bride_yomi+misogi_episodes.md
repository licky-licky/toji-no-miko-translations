## [Bride Yomi: Start]: Undercover Investigation (Yomi's Case)
**Yomi:** There was another person who had their ring stolen by aradama?  
**Chapel Staff:** Yes...  
**Yume:** I get it... That means we've got a thief to catch, Yomi-onee-san\!  
**Yomi:** Yes, and the culprit is an aradama.  
**Yume:** Sounds like it\! So let's start searching\! We'll do an undercover search\!  
**Yomi:** ...An undercover search?  
**Yume:** Yeah\! I'll wear a wedding dress and lure it out, so you just have to watch me, Yomi-onee-san\!  
**Yomi:** ...Is there a dress available for us to use?  
**Chapel Staff:** Ah, yes, of course. I'll have one for you right away.  
**Yume:** A wedding dress\~\! I can't wait\~\!  
**Yomi:** So this is the reason you proposed an undercover search.  
**Yomi:** Very well. Then, please leave the aradama to me.  
**Yume:** Why\!\?  
**Yomi:** It's possible the aradama may not appear if you are holding an okatana.  
**Yomi:** The decoy should focus entirely on luring out the aradama. The guard will take care of the rest.  
**Yume:** I don't want to wear a wedding dress then\! You wear it, Yomi-onee-san\!  
**Yomi:** Weren't you looking forward to wearing it?  
**Yume:** I was, but... If I don't fight, then I can't show off my good side.  
**Yomi:** ...Understood.  
**Yomi:** We will switch off acting as the decoy, so I will have a wedding dress prepared for me as well.  
**Yume:** Hey hey? Is it okay if I take a picture of you wearing your dress, Yomi-onee-san?  
**Yomi:** ...What would you need that for?  
**Yume:** To remember the occasion\! We might not get to do this again, so I want to show everyone\!  
**Yomi:** ...Eh? Everyone...?  
**Yume:** Maki-onee-san and Suzuka-onee-san and Yukari-sama\!  
**Yomi:** Th-That would be...  
**Yume:** No backing out-\! We're doing it for sure-\! Ahaha, I can't wait-\!  
**Yomi:** For... sure?  
**Yume:** Yeah\!

## [Bride Yomi: End]: Please Don't Look
**Yume:** Is she ready yet-, is Yomi-onee-san ready yet-?  
**Yomi:** ...Sorry for taking so long.  
**Yume:** Ah, I've been waiting forever, Yomi-on--  
**Yume:** ...Wow\! You look super pretty, Yomi-onee-san\!  
**Yomi:** D-Do you think so? It doesn't feel right on me...  
**Yume:** No way\! You're like a real bride\!  
**Yomi:** ...Th-Thank you very much. Hopefully the aradama thinks I am a real bride too...  
**Yume:** What do you want to do until the aradama shows up? Should we walk around?  
**Yomi:** First, we should wait here.  
**Yomi:** If it doesn't come... Then we can walk around a little.  
**Yume:** Hey hey, while we wait for the aradama, I can take some pictures, right?  
**Yomi:** ...Please don't point your phone at me.  
**Yume:** There's no way I'm passing up something this fun. Give me a smile\!  
**Yomi:** ...  
**Yume:** C'mon-\! You have to smile\!  
**Yomi:** I thought I was smiling...  
**Yume:** You're not smiling at all. Like, say cheese\!  
**Yomi:** Ch-Cheese?  
**Yume:** Hmm, you still aren't smiling right.  
**Aradama:** GUOOOOOOO\!\!  
**Yomi:** Ah\!\? Tsubakuro-san\! The aradama\!  
**Yume:** Oh, you're right. HAAAA\!\!  
**Yume:** Huh, that was nothing.  
**Yomi:** ...Tsubakuro-san, you weren't supposed to defeat it. Now we can't identify where the stolen ring was taken.  
**Yume:** The heck, that sounds annoying.  
**Yomi:** We have no choice but to wait for another aradama to appear.  
**Yukari:** You did well on your assignment. ...Yomi?  
**Yomi:** Yes?  
**Yukari:** That wedding dress suited you.  
**Yomi:** H-How did you... Tsubakuro-san\!\?  
**Yume:** Ah, yep. I showed it around to everyone.  
**Yomi:** B-By everyone, you mean...  
**Yume:** Maki-onee-san, and Suzuka-onee-san\~.  
**Yomi:** I should have firmly refused...

## [Ceremonial Dress - Misogi: Start]: Yomi's Weak Point
**Tsugumi:** Are you ready to start?  
**Yomi:** I am ready at any time... Let's begin disposing of the aradama.  
**Aradama:** GAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Yomi:** ...\!  
**Yomi:** ...Please, bring out the next one.  
**Tsugumi:** We're going through them at a good pace. You've been working hard, Satsuki-san. Let's take a quick break.  
**Yomi:** ...I do not need a break.  
**Tsugumi:** Hmmm, considering the margins for safety, I'd prefer if you were rested though.  
**Tsugumi:** The next aradama to appear will be more powerful, so it could be difficult if you aren't in peak condition.  
**Yomi:** ...There won't be any problems.  
**Tsugumi:** ...Understood. If that's what you believe, we'll continue.  
**Tsugumi:** Though, if you ever feel in danger, just say so, okay?  
**Yomi:** Right.  
**Tsugumi:** In that case, I'll send out the next one.  
**Bull Type Aradama:** ......  
**Yomi:** ...\!\? A bull type...  
**Bull Type Aradama:** ROAAAAAAAAR\!  
**Yomi:** Hya...  
**Tsugumi:** Satsuki-san?  
**Yomi:** Ah......  
**Tsugumi:** Satsuki-san\!\? What's wrong, Satsuki-san\!\!  
**Bull Type Aradama:** GAAAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Yomi:** AAAAUGH\!\!  
**Yomi:** ...Where am I? I remember, I was in the laboratory...  
**Yume:** Ah, you're awake, Yomi-onee-san.  
**Yomi:** Yes... Good morning, Tsubakuro-san.  
**Yume:** Now's not the time to be saying, "Good morning"\!  
**Yume:** I was getting worried that you weren't going to wake up, you know?  
**Yomi:** You're right... It seems I wasn't thinking straight.  
**Yomi:** I thought I was at Ban-san's lab, but now...  
**Yume:** I was worried, so I had them bring you here. I'm not supposed to leave here since I'm on duty.  
**Yomi:** ...Is that so. Thank you, Tsubakuro-san.  
**Yume:** You don't have to thank me.  
**Yume:** Anyway, were the aradama at that researcher onee-san's place that strong? I thought she didn't have anything but weaklings.  
**Yomi:** That's right. It was an ordinary aradama.  
**Yume:** Why'd you get hurt then?  
**Yomi:** That's because... It's somewhat of a long story. Do you want to hear it?  
**Yume:** Yeah\! Tell me all about it\!  
**Yomi:** It happened when I was in elementary school... I was involved in an aradama incident.

## [Ceremonial Dress - Misogi: End]: To One Day Repay Her
**Yomi:** It happened when I was in elementary school... I was involved in an aradama incident.  
**Yume:** Was it something like... The aradama back then was the same kind as the one at the lab?  
**Yomi:** ...How did you know that?  
**Yume:** Anybody could figure that out. There's nothing else it could be.  
**Yomi:** ...I see. In that case, there's no need for me to explain the rest.  
**Yume:** Ehh, I wanna hear more about what you were like when you were younger, Yomi-onee-san\!  
**Yume:** What were you like back then?  
**Yomi:** What was I like...? A normal elementary school student. I was a normal girl.  
**Yume:** There's gotta be something more, right?  
**Yomi:** ...There was nothing special about me. I was normal.  
**Yomi:** Anyway, the incident involved a bull type aradama appearing on the main road... Several vehicles had been totaled.  
**Yomi:** I was also nearly crushed by it.  
**Yume:** That's like something out of a monster movie.  
**Yomi:** Yes, I felt that I would die there. However... Moments later, a platoon of toji from Renpu arrived, and I was safely rescued.  
**Yume:** Right in the nick of time\! Do you know any of the girls who saved you?  
**Yomi:** ...I only learned this later on, but the one directing that platoon was President Takatsu.  
**Yume:** Really\!\?  
**Yomi:** Yes. I want to repay her for that someday.  
**Yume:** Repay her? Like how? By beating more aradama?  
**Yomi:** ...Something like that.  
**Yomi:** Since that incident, I had never faced another bull type aradama... But it seems my body still remembers the fear it felt then.  
**Yume:** Hmmm. In that case, you should chop up that bull aradama.  
**Yomi:** ...What?  
**Yume:** You're only scared cause it beat you\! So, won't you be fine after you kill one?  
**Yomi:** ...Will I?  
**Yomi:** No... You're right, if possible, I would like to overcome it one day...  
**Yume:** Since you agree with me, let's go to the lab\!  
**Yomi:** ...Eh?  
**Yume:** Onee-san, get a bull type aradama ready for us-\!  
**Tsugumi:** Tsubakuro-san, and... I see you're up and about again, Satsuki-san.  
**Yomi:** I'm sorry to have made you worry.  
**Tsugumi:** No no, it wasn't your fault.  
**Tsugumi:** Anyway, a bull type aradama? I can have it ready in a moment, so are you ready to fight, Tsubakuro-san?  
**Yume:** What do you mean? I'm not the one fighting it; Yomi-onee-san is.  
**Tsugumi:** Satsuki-san... Will fight it?  
**Yomi:** Tsubakuro-san, if I see that aradama again, it's likely my body will freeze up once more.  
**Yume:** I know that; the whole reason we're here is to help you beat that.  
**Yume:** Don't worry about anything. If it looks like you're in trouble, I'll chop up that aradama for you.  
**Yume:** Then you'll get used to it after a while, right?  
**Tsugumi:** Well, in that case... I suppose there would be no danger.  
**Yomi:** (I think my mental state will be in danger however...)  
**Yomi:** ...I understand.  
**Yomi:** It would cause problems if I were unable to act in the field, so please help me, Tsubakuro-san.  
**Yume:** You got it\!  
**Yomi:** Then... Ban-san, please begin. I'm going to accustom myself to fighting the bull type aradama.  
**Bull Type Aradama:** ROAAAAAAAR\!  
**Yomi:** ...\!  
**Yume:** Way to go, Yomi-onee-san\! You dodged its attack\!  
**Yomi:** ...It seems I'm growing used to my fear.  
**Yume:** Think you can beat it?  
**Yomi:** I'll try, but...\!\?  
**Bull Type Aradama:** GUUUOOOOO\!\!  
**Yomi:** (...I'm scared. My body won't stop shaking... This fear won't be erased so easily after all...)  
**Yomi:** (Though... I did manage to stop its attack.)  
**Bull Type Aradama:** OOUUUUUUU\!\!  
**Yume:** Yomi-onee-san\!\?  
**Yomi:** (If I lose focus, I could be crushed... However, as I am now, I can stop these attacks...)  
**Yomi:** [Inhale... Exhale...]  
**Yomi:** ...HAA\!  
**Bull Type Aradama:** GYAAAAAOOOOOO\!\!  
**Yume:** You did it-\! See, it went just like I said it would, right?  
**Yomi:** ...You were right. Thank you very much, Tsubakuro-san.

## [Ceremonial Dress - Misogi: Start]: Isolation
**Hiyori:** (When did this start, I wonder? When I became conscious of my loneliness.)  
**Hiyori:** (At the very least, I didn't used to be like this. Because, back then, all I could ever think of was getting stronger.)  
**Hiyori:** To take the duty my mother left behind into my own hands...  
**Himeno Shiho:** Ah, heyyy\! Juujou-saaan\! Wait up-\!  
**Hiyori:** Nn? You're...  
**Shiho:** Himeno Shiho; we're in the same grade. Let's get along.  
**Hiyori:** ...Right.  
**Shiho:** So hey, you're strong aren't you, Juujou-san? You really surprised me.  
**Hiyori:** ...I guess. Did you want something?  
**Shiho:** Ah, that's right.  
**Shiho:** My skills with a sword are still nowhere near that good. So, if it's alright with you, I was wondering if you could teach me some things later?  
**Shiho:** I mean, just if you have some free time.  
**Hiyori:** ...Sorry, but there's something I have to do.  
**Shiho:** Oh, okay... Hmm, that's too bad.  
**Shiho:** Hey, there's Chinami\! Heyyy, want to do some practice together now-?  
**Kamo Chinami:** Mm, okay\! Now's perfect; I was just thinking of practicing not getting my hair and clothes so disheveled while I'm fighting.  
**Shiho:** Cool\! Then, I'll talk to you later, Juujou-san\!  
**Hiyori:** Practicing together, huh...  
**Hiyori:** ...Well, I should get going now.  
**Hiyori:** HMPH, HAA, YAAA, HAA\!  
**Hiyori:** (The only thing I thought about then was growing stronger.)  
**Hiyori:** HAAAA, HAA\! SEI, YAA, HAA, HAAA, YAA\!  
**Hiyori:** (I distanced myself from others as best as I could, and lived only to polish my own skills.)  
**Hiyori:** I have to be faster, sharper, stronger...\!  
**Hiyori:** (I had to be the one to carry out what my mother failed to finish. And so I was always alone. Still, I never once felt lonely.)  
**Hiyori:** HAAAAAAA, HAA\!\!  
**Hiyori:** Pant... Pant... Pant... Kh, is that all it takes for me to lose my breath...\!  
**Hiyori:** I can keep going...\! I'm not done here yet...\!  
**Hiyori:** (That's right... Until I met Kanami and the others, and began spending time with them...)  

## [Ceremonial Dress - Misogi: End]: Growth
**Hiyori:** (It was after I met Kanami and the others that, before I knew it, it had become unusual for me to be alone.)  
**Hiyori:** (So is that the reason? Why, when I'm by myself, I started feeling my loneliness.)  
**Hiyori:** (After feeling that, I wanted to ask myself.)  
**Hiyori:** (Have I gotten weaker than I used to be...?)  
**Aradama:** KWAAAAAAA-\!\!\!  
**Hiyori:** Urgh...\!  
**Hiyori:** Pant, pant... Damnit... Is this how it ends up as soon as I want some time to think on my own...  
**Hiyori:** Still... I didn't expect this swarm of aradama to show up here...  
**Aradama:** GRRRRUUU...\!  
**Hiyori:** (Here they come...\!)  
**???:** No you don't-\! YAAAA\!  
**Aradama:** GAAA,aaaa...  
**Kanami:** Are you okay, Hiyori-chan\!\?  
**Hiyori:** K-Kanami...?  
**Mai:** And she's not the only one who came to help.  
**Hiyori:** Mai, and the rest of you too...?  
**Ellen:** You should be thanking Nene, Hiyoyon. Nene was the one who noticed the aradama and led us here\!  
**Nene:** Nene-\!  
**Kanami:** Look, everybody\! That one there should be the boss aradama\!  
**Aradama:** GGGGAAAAAAAAA-\!\!  
**Sayaka:** Mai, give us orders.  
**Mai:** Right, okay. Everyone, deal with the nearby aradama. Kanami-chan, do you think you can hold off the boss for a while? While you do that, I'll take Hiyori-chan to safety.  
**Kanami:** Sure, I'm on it, Mai-chan\! YAAAAAAA\!  
**Ellen:** We should go too, Kaoru\!  
**Kaoru:** Not like we have a say in it.  
**Mai:** Alright, you come with me, Hiyori-chan.  
**Hiyori:** (But, I can't just leave everyone else behind...\!)  
**Hiyori:** Mai, I'm going to stand and fight too.  
**Mai:** Eh? But, you're hurt...?  
**Hiyori:** This is nothing. Besides, we can't leave Kanami to fight that boss aradama by herself.  
**Hiyori:** Let's go, Mai. We'll all sweep through the aradama at once. HAAAAAA\!  
**Hiyori:** (In a sense, maybe I have gotten weaker. Since I met Kanami, I came to realize my own loneliness; how weak I am on my own.)  
**Hiyori:** (Even so, being able to fight side by side with others like I am now, I'm sure I can accomplish things I couldn't before.)  
**Hiyori:** (In that case, this strength is enough.)  
**Hiyori:** (With this, I won't regret these days I spend with Kanami and the rest. No matter what may come, I won't regret it.)  
Kanami

--A while before the tournament took place.

  
**Fukuda Sawano:** You want a serious match... Against me?  
**Kanami:** Yes\! If you don't mind\!  
**Mai:** Kanami-chan\! Don't go asking one of our senpai something like that out of nowhere\! It's rude\!  
**Kanami:** Sorry about that, Mai-chan. But, I just want to see how all kinds of different people fight.  
**Sawano:** I'm alright with fighting you, but... As you know, I'm only the "Lord of the Library".  
**Kanami:** Ahaha, sorry about when I called you that...  
**Kanami:** But actually, after that, I heard you were a very reliable fighter, so I wanted to try facing off with you at least once\!  
**Sawano:** ...I understand. Show me the skills of someone who's spent more time in books than anyone.  
**Kanami:** Yesss\! Thank you very much\!  
**Mai:** Kanami-chan's spent more time in books than anyone...?  
**Kanami:** I'll explain that later\! Mai-chan, please be our referee\!  
**Mai:** O-Okay... Then, begin\!  
**Kanami:** ...  
**Sawano:** (She isn't launching an attack...? In that case, I'll go to her\!)  
**Sawano:** HAA\!  
**Kanami:** ...  
**Sawano:** (Eh\!\? She vanished\!\?)  
**Sawano:** (Behind me\!\? In a split second\!\?)  
**Kanami:** YAAAA-\!  
**Sawano:** Kh... HAAAAA\!  
--That night, in Kanami's dreams.

  
**Minato:** Hmm... So? How'd the match turn out?  
**Kanami:** I ended up winning.  
**Minato:** Hey, that's great\!  
**Kanami:** ...  
**Minato:** What's wrong? You don't look too happy about it?  
**Kanami:** No, I'm pretty happy I won. It's just, I wanted to keep fighting on and on...  
**Minato:** You're saying you didn't even get to hit your stride? Now you're getting cocky about it.  
**Kanami:** It's not like that\!  
**Kanami:** I want to fight more and more, so I can be like you.  
**Minato:** You're starting all these matches to be more like me?  
**Kanami:** That's because, you aren't there in the real world... If you were there, then I wouldn't have to.  
**Minato:** That sounds like it'd be a real waste. You're finally getting to fight people besides me.  
**Kanami:** It'd be a waste?  
**Minato:** Each and every fight means you get more people to "Look close\! Listen well\! Focus on your senses\!\" with.  
**Kanami:** And that's...  
**Minato:** If you keep that in mind, you could learn even more than you already are, okay?  
**Kanami:** Look close, listen well, focus on your senses... Okay\! Thanks, Master\!

## [Ceremonial Dress - Misogi: End]: The Essentials of Swordsmanship
**Mai:** Eh? You want to have a serious match with me?  
**Kanami:** Yeah\! Please, Mai-chan\!  
**Mai:** You know I don't mind, but, where is this coming from?  
**Kanami:** We always practice together, but I hardly know anything about you. So I was thinking, we could get to know each other better like this.  
**Mai:** You want to know more about me...?  
**Kanami:** Ehehe, sorry for asking you something so weird out of nowhere. When I woke up this morning, I just had this on my mind.  
**Mai:** I don't quite understand, but... Alright. And if you're that eager about it, then I'm going to come at you with all I've got\!  
**Kanami:** Thanks, Mai-chan\! Then, let's get started\!  
**Mai:** (Here she comes...\!)  
**Kanami:** (Stare...)  
**Mai:** (Wait? Kanami-chan is acting differently than usual...?)  
**Mai:** (But, if that's the case, I might be able to fight against her...\!)  
**Kanami:** (Ah, Mai-chan's stance changed. Woww, the way she's angling her sword is beautiful. It looks flexible at a glance, but I can tell she's holding it firm from her center.)  
**Kanami:** (Oh, she closed the distance between us just a little bit\! I get it... She's looking to see how I'll react. Then, if I move like this...)  
**Mai:** (Kanami-chan lowered her body...\! Is she preparing to charge? Then, I'll...)  
**Kanami:** (Mai-chan took in a deep breath...\! Maybe she's looking to set up a counter? But, in that stance, what would it look like...?)  
**Kanami:** (Mmmm, I can't picture it at all... But... In that case, I just have to see for myself\!)  
**Mai:** (There it is\! Kanami-chan moves so fast\! But, I should be able to--)  
**Mai:** YAAAA\!  
**Mai:** Aww, I lost... You're too tough for me after all, Kanami-chan...  
**Kanami:** No way, you were great too, Mai-chan\! When you came rushing out back there, I wasn't expecting it at all\!  
**Kanami:** That was Hokushin Itto-Ryu's "Kiri-otoshi", right?  
**Mai:** Yep, you got it.  
**Kanami:** I knew it\! Please, Mai-chan\! Show it to me again\!  
**Mai:** Fufu, I guess I don't have a choice.  
**Kanami:** Awesome-\!  
**Kanami:** And, after that, I want to try using your move myself, so will you have another match with me too?  
**Kanami:** Please\! I'm begging you\!  
**Mai:** Then, on the other hand, I'll try moving like you did, Kanami-chan.  
**Kanami:** You're the best, Mai-chan-\!  
**Kanami:** (Look close. Listen well. Focus on your senses.)  
**Kanami:** (Just by keeping that in mind, swordfighting gets so much more interesting...\!)  
**Kanami:** (But, why did I suddenly think to try doing that? I feel like someone told me about it, but...)  
**Kanami:** (Well, whoever they are, I've got to thank them someday\!)

## [Ceremonial Dress - Misogi: Start]: Lacking the Words
**Toji A:** What now... Yanase-san, Itomi-san\! Many more aradama are coming this way...\!  
**Mai:** It might be frightening, but no matter how many there are, what we need to do hasn't changed.  
**Mai:** Everyone finished evacuating, so let's hold our formation and take them out.  
**Sayaka:** It's okay. I can... Deal with them.  
**Mai:** Sayaka-chan\!\?  
**Aradama:** GGIII...\!  
**Sayaka:** --HAA\!  
**Aradama:** KSHAAA--\!  
**Sayaka:** Kh...  
**Sayaka:** (I want to be strong enough to defeat them on my own. If I can't... I can't protect everyone.)  
**Sayaka:** --YAAAAA\!\!  
**Toji A:** Itomi-san... That was amazing. She stopped all those aradama by herself...  
**Mai:** Sayaka-chan...  
**Sayaka:** Mai.  
**Mai:** Why did you run off and break formation?  
**Sayaka:** ...? ...I made sure to kill all the aradama.  
**Mai:** That's true. You did defeat the aradama. Still, you might be strong, Sayaka-chan, but you're not supposed to fight on your own.  
**Mai:** And you were even hurt a little.  
**Sayaka:** I thought this would be the fastest...  
**Sayaka:** You have to exorcise rampaging aradama as fast as you can.  
**Mai:** Mmm... That's not what I mean though.  
**Sayaka:** Then what...? Mai, I don't... understand.  
**Mai:** Ah, stop, Sayaka-chan\!  
**Mai:** ...Sayaka-chan.  
--The next day.

  
**Sayaka:** ......  
**Sayaka:** (...I want to talk to Mai. But... If what happened yesterday happens... I don't want that.)  
**Sayaka:** (What should I do...)  
**Kaoru:** Oh, there you are, Sayaka. So, what happened?  
**Sayaka:** ...Kaoru, there's something I need your help with.  
**Kaoru:** So you got told off by Mai during a mission yesterday, then you ran away, and now it's hard to talk to her like usual?  
**Sayaka:** With things like this... I don't know what I'm supposed to do.  
**Kaoru:** I know you want to make up with her. But, why did you do something reckless like fighting the aradama by yourself?  
**Sayaka:** Because I want to be stronger. So nobody has to go through anything painful.  
**Kaoru:** Well, Mai said she's worried about you too.  
**Sayaka:** Mai did...?  
**Sayaka:** She isn't... Mad at me?  
**Kaoru:** I mean, of course she's mad when you put yourself in danger. But it's not like she's mad because she hates you now.  
**Sayaka:** ......  
**Sayaka:** Kaoru... I want to be with Mai like I used to.  
**Kaoru:** If you think you did something wrong, then tell her you're sorry. After that, tell her how you feel. Then you'll make up.  
**Sayaka:** Thank you. I'm going to go see Mai.  
**Sayaka:** Orders to suppress aradama... I have to go.

**Sayaka:** M-Mai...  
**Mai:** Wh-What is it, Sayaka-chan?  
**Sayaka:** I'll stop the aradama that are coming from the sea.  
**Mai:** Okay, good luck... We'll take care of the aradama trying to enter town.  
**Sayaka:** ...I'm going.  
**Mai:** Sigh... Just when I finally had a chance to talk to Sayaka-chan.  
**Mai:** No... Right now, I have to focus on dealing with the aradama here.

**Sayaka:** (I want to... Finish this fast, so I can make up with Mai, but...)  
**Sayaka:** (There's a lot of them today...)  
**Aradama:** GGGIIII...\!  
**Mai:** Sayaka-chan\!\?  
**Aradama:** KSHAAAA\!\!  
**Sayaka:** ...Kgh\!\?  
**Mai:** Are you okay\!\?  
**Sayaka:** I-I'm fine... It wasn't that bad.  
**Mai:** Thank goodness... You have to make sure not to lose focus, okay?  
**Sayaka:** Th-Thank you, Mai.  
**Mai:** Let's just give it one last push.  
**Sayaka:** Mai, give me orders.  
**Mai:** Okay. Then--  
**Mai:** Good work, Sayaka-chan. ...Why don't we go back to the dorms?  
**Sayaka:** Before that... There's something I have to tell you...  
**Sayaka:** I'm sorry, Mai... I didn't listen to what you told me yesterday... And I made you worry today...  
**Mai:** No, I should apologize too.  
**Mai:** To tell the truth, Kaoru-chan told me about how she spoke with you. But still... I couldn't make up with you right away...  
**Sayaka:** No, that was my fault.  
**Sayaka:** I never had any friends before, so I didn't know how to make up after we fought.  
**Mai:** But I also should have explained sooner why I was warning you yesterday. Then there wouldn't have been this misunderstanding.  
**Sayaka:** Mai. I... I want to get even stronger. So, what happened yesterday... I might do it again.  
**Mai:** In that case, we should get stronger together.  
**Sayaka:** But, I want to get stronger so I can protect all of you. You're going to get stronger with me, Mai?  
**Mai:** That's right. I feel like getting stronger too, so I can protect you and everyone else.  
**Mai:** Because you're a very important friend to me.  
**Sayaka:** I... I feel the same way. Let's do our best, Mai.
