Covers both Halloween events.

  

## 1: It's Nearly Halloween\!
**Kanami:** Mai-chan, Sayaka-chan, hurry up\!  
**Mai:** Wait for us, Kanami-chan. If you keep running like that you'll bump into something. Be more careful.  
**Kanami:** But I'm just so excited that we're all out shopping together.  
**Kanami:** Sniff, sniff... Something smells nice. Oh, they're selling crepes\! Sayaka-chan, when we're done shopping, we should get some crepes.  
**Sayaka:** Mm, they look tasty.  
**Mai:** They have so many flavors that it seems hard to choose just one. Sayaka-chan, pick up a menu so we can take our time thinking about it while we're out.  
**Sayaka:** Okay. They all look good... Nn? Pumpkin flavor... I've never seen that before.  
**Kanami:** Look, look\! That store over there is selling witch costumes and magic staffs. They look really well made.  
**Kanami:** Ah, those pumpkin decorations over there are cute too.  
**Sayaka:** More pumpkins... Why...?  
**Mai:** That's right, it'll be Halloween soon, won't it?  
**Sayaka:** I've heard of that, but I've never done it. Halloween... What is it?  
**Mai:** It's a day where you put on costumes, go around town collecting sweets, and eat a feast of pumpkins.  
**Sayaka:** Sweets... Feast... Gulp.  
**Mai:** I know. Why don't we invite all the toji to a Halloween party?  
**Sayaka:** Party?  
**Kanami:** That sounds fun\! Let's do it, let's do it, let's throw a big party\!  
**Kanami:** And while we're at it, why don't we get some costumes here too?  
**Mai:** That could be fun\! I wonder what kind of costumes would suit everyone.  
**Sayaka:** I saw a black cat costume in that store earlier. Hiyori would look good in it.  
**Kanami:** Now that you mention it... A black cat would be perfect for Hiyori-chan. I want to bring it back to her as a present now.  
**Mai:** If Hiyori-chan is a black cat, Kaoru-chan would be... What about a wolf?  
**Kanami:** Yeah, she's look so cute like that\! Now Ellen-chan has such a nice figure, so anything would fit her... I know, she could be a miniskirt nurse\!  
**Mai:** Isn't that just cosplay, Kanami-chan...?  
**Kanami:** Ahaha, you're right. But I still think it'd look good on her.  
**Mai:** Sayaka-chan, what kind of costume do you want to wear?  
**Sayaka:** I'll just wear what I normally do...  
**Kanami:** Ehh, but you could wear all kinds of cute clothes, Sayaka-chan.  
**Sayaka:** You can't dress normal to a Halloween party?  
**Mai:** You can wear whatever you want. Even if it's only a party with a big feast and lots of cookies, it'll be a lot of fun.  
**Sayaka:** A feast with cookies... I want to try it.  
**Mai:** Really? Then I can make some delicious Halloween food for you and everyone else.  
**Kanami:** A party where Mai-chan's cooking\! I know everyone will want to come. You don't have to wear a costume, Sayaka-chan, so you'll come too, right?  
**Sayaka:** Mm. If I get to eat Mai's cooking, I'll go.  
**Mai:** In that case, we should start the party preparations straight away.  

## 2: Shopping for the Party
**Mai:** Sorry to make you come grocery shopping with me, Kanami-chan, Sayaka-chan.  
**Kanami:** Don't worry about it\! We can't make you do all the preparations for the party by yourself, you know.  
**Sayaka:** Mm. Kanami and I will do anything to support the feast you're making.  
**Mai:** Thank you, both of you. If there's anything you can think of you want to eat, feel free to make any requests.  
**Kanami:** Allllright. Then, I want fried chicken, and sushi, and ice cream, and...  
**Mai:** None of that is very Halloween-y though... But I'll try coming up with ways to make those Halloween themed.  
**Sayaka:** Mai, that apple pie looks tasty.  
**Mai:** It does, doesn't it? I know, how about instead I bake you a pumpkin pie?  
**Sayaka:** You can make pie from pumpkins...? If Mai makes it, I want to eat it.  
**Mai:** Then, could you go and get me one pumpkin?  
**Sayaka:** Okay.  
**Kanami:** Mai-chan, Sayaka-chan, check out these fried croquettes. Don't they look good\!  
**Mai:** A pumpkin croquette could work too. Kanami-chan, could you get another pumpkin?  
**Kanami:** On it\!  
**Kanami:** Here you go\!  
**Mai:** With pumpkin I can make pie and croquettes, then gratin... Thanks to you two, this menu is starting to come together.  
**Sayaka:** It all sounds tasty. I'll get more pumpkins.  
**Kanami:** I'll help you out. We should get one for pumpkin salad, one for pumpkin gratin, one for pumpkin pudding, one for pumpkin soup... And then some more too.  
**Mai:** There's so many pumpkins in the cart. They all look good, but I don't know how we can eat this much...  
**Mihono:** Huh? Kanami\! And Mai and Sayaka too.  
**Chie:** What a coincidence. Are you shopping too?  
**Kanami:** Yep, that's right.  
**Mihono:** But... What's up with your cart? What are you gonna do with all those pumpkins?  
**Kanami:** We were thinking of doing a Halloween party, so this is for that. Do you two think you can come?  
**Mihono:** Can we? Of course I'll be there\! I'm going for sure. Can I invite the others too?  
**Mai:** Go right ahead\! I'll look forward to having more people sample my cooking.  
**Chie:** Yanase-san, does that mean you'll use all those pumpkins in cooking for the party?  
**Mai:** Yes. We mostly have the menu planned out now. But if there's anything else you want to eat, tell me and I'll write it down.  
**Mihono:** What, all of these? You're really going all out on this party.  
**Chie:** Yanase-san, are you planning on doing all the cooking by yourself?  
**Kanami:** It's a lot of work to do alone, so Sayaka-chan and I were going to help her.  
**Mihono:** Wow-\! You can cook too, Kanami?  
**Kanami:** W-Well, I'm not that good at it... What about you, Sayaka? You've got fast hands, so you seem like you'd be a natural at cooking.  
**Sayaka:** Cooking... How do you cook?  
**Chie:** Fufu. Yanase-san, if it's no trouble for you, do you mind if I help cook?  
**Mai:** No, I can't make you do that. I want everyone to enjoy this party, but if you're stuck helping out it defeats the purpose.  
**Chie:** Don't worry about that. Besides, if you want everyone to enjoy this party, you should be having a good time too, shouldn't you?  
**Chie:** If you wear yourself out doing all the cooking, you'll be too busy to enjoy the party, Yanase-san.  
**Mai:** Setouchi-san...  
**Mihono:** You should take her up on that, Mai. Chii-nee's cooking is super yummy, you know?  
**Mai:** In that case, could I please ask you to help me get things ready?  
**Chie:** Sure, just leave it to your onee-san.  
**Mihono:** Nice. Between Chii-nee and Mai's home cooking, there's no way I'm missing this party\!  

## 3: Mai and Chie's Cooking Classroom
**Kanami:** Ahh, we're finally back... I never thought the supermarket could feel so far away from school before.  
**Mihono:** Pumpkins sure are heavy. Are you really going to be able to use all these?  
**Chie:** Don't worry, Yanase-san and I will be sure to turn them all into delicious food. Right, Yanase-san?  
**Mai:** That's right.  
**Chie:** Now then, why don't we get to work on getting these pumpkins ready?  
**Mihono:** I'll lend a hand. What do you need help with first?  
**Mai:** We need to cut the pumpkins for every item on the menu, so... How about this\! Before we start cooking, why don't we all make jack o' lanterns?  
**Chie:** Good idea, we need to scoop out the insides for cooking anyway.  
**Kanami:** And it'll start feeling more like Halloween\!  
**Sayaka:** Mai, how do you make a jack o' lantern?  
**Mai:** First, you need to cut out the bottom of the pumpkin. Then you use a spoon to pull out all the seeds and everything inside.  
**Chie:** It's tough, so be careful not to hurt yourself with the kitchen knife.  
**Mihono:** Okay, I can handle that\!  
**Kanami:** Yeah, let's give it a shot.  
**Kanami:** Nngh... Ughhh, she's right. I can't get the knife through the outside...  
**Mihono:** Mmghhh, I got the knife in, but I can't go any further than that... Ughh, where there's a will... There's a way\!  
**Mihono:** Aghhh, I give up. It's not budging an inch.  
**Sayaka:** Mai, I finished cutting through the bottom. What do I do now?  
**Mai:** You finished already, Sayaka-chan? Eh, that's amazing\! You cut through it so cleanly.  
**Chie:** You're really good at this, Itomi-san; cutting through the tough pumpkin like that.  
**Kanami:** How'd you do that, Sayaka-chan? Show us your secret\!  
**Sayaka:** Secret?  
**Sayaka:** If you use your okatana... It's easy.  
**Mai:** S-Sayaka-chan...  
**Mihono:** Oh yeah, I didn't think of that.  
**Kanami:** Yep, with my okatana, I'm not afraid of any pumpkin\! Let me try.  
**Chie:** Ha-Hang on a minute. It's true that okatana are sharp, but why don't we try sticking to kitchen knives for cooking?  
**Mai:** I agree\! Since we have the chance, wouldn't using a cooking knife make for good practice in the future...?  
**Sayaka:** If Mai says so, then I'll do it.  
**Chie:** I'll help show Mihono-chan and Etou-san how, so why don't you look after Itomi-san, Yanase-san?  
**Mai:** Alright. Take care of Kanami-chan for me.  
**Chie:** Mmhm, just leave it to your onee-san.  
**Mai:** (Setouchi-san is so reliable and wonderful...)  
**Sayaka:** Mai, how should I hold the kitchen knife?  
**Mai:** Let's see, when you're cutting something tough, put your hands on the back of the knife and the handle, and little by little push down using the weight of your body.  
**Sayaka:** I'll try that. Nng... It's hard.  
**Mai:** You're doing it, Sayaka-chan. Just like that, nice and slowly.  
**Chie:** Ah, the phone. Yes, hello... Eh, there's aradama nearby? Okay, we'll be right there.  
**Mihono:** Aradama? I was just getting used to the kitchen knife, but it sounds like it's time to trade it back for my okatana.  
**Kanami:** Right. We should all go.  
**Chie:** Wait, it sounds like there aren't many aradama this time, so there's no need for every one of us to go.  
**Kanami:** Okay then. Why don't the three of us go, and you and Mai-chan can stay and cook?  
**Mihono:** Sounds good to me. We'll take care of the aradama, so Chii-nee and Mai can keep cooking up that feast\!  
**Sayaka:** I won't lose to aradama. I'm going.  

## 4: Cooking Time With Two
**Chie:** Are those carrots going in the pumpkin stew? I like the cute shapes you cut them in.  
**Mai:** When they look like this, even children who won't eat carrots might eat them. My little sisters are picky, but I can get them to eat this way.  
**Chie:** You're a good sister, Yanase-san.  
**Mai:** I-I don't know about that...  
**Chie:** I'll get the pie crust ready, so could you take the pumpkin that's in the steam cooker out and crush it?  
**Mai:** Okay.  
**Chie:** And, counting backwards from when we need it freshly baked, it might be better to start heating up the oven now.  
**Mai:** Good idea.  
**Mai:** (Setouchi-san is amazing. She isn't only good at cooking, but her instructions are perfect too.)  
**Mai:** (Compared to her, I have such a long way to go... I have to pick up the pace so I'm not holding her back.)  
**Mai:** Setouchi-san, I'll chop the onions for you.  
**Chie:** Oh, you're so good with that knife. But you shouldn't be in such a hurry. Your eyes won't hurt as much if you give them time to recover.  
**Mai:** Thank you for your concern. But, I feel fine.  
**Mai:** (My eyes actually do hurt a little... But if I take a break, then Setouchi-san will get worried about me. I just need to bear with it a little longer.)  
**Chie:** You really are good at this though, I mean it. It's beautiful the way you can go so fast, yet they all come out the same size.  
**Mai:** Thank you very much. I use a kitchen knife every day, so I'm used to it...  
**Mai:** Ow-\!  
**Chie:** Eh, Yanase-san, what's wrong\!\? Are you okay?  
**Mai:** Sorry, I was just a little clumsy.  
**Chie:** Did you cut yourself?  
**Mai:** I'm fine. Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you like that.  
**Chie:** I'm just glad to hear you're okay. You don't need to rush yourself.  
**Mai:** I know. Then, I'll get back to work now.  
**Mai:** (Uuuu, the cut is stinging... But, it's too embarrassing telling Setouchi-san I cut myself while I was trying to show off to her, so I just have to hold it in...)  
**Chie:** Yanase-san? Let me see your hand. Ah, like I thought, you're bleeding.  
**Chie:** We have to take care of that, so it doesn't leave a scar. The band-aids are... Ah, there they are. I have to disinfect it now, so bear with me for a moment.  
**Mai:** I'm sorry. We should be working now, but...  
**Chie:** You don't have to apologize for anything. Everyone makes mistakes once in a while.  
**Mai:** I really am sorry. I, I wanted to take the lead like you do, so I started working faster, but now I'm just wasting time...  
**Chie:** I see. Yanase-san, I think it's wonderful the way you're always so considerate of others. There there, good girl.  
**Mai:** S-Setouchi-san... You're rubbing my head...  
**Chie:** Ah, I'm sorry, I couldn't help myself. You just looked so cute trying so hard, Yanase-san.  
**Chie:** But, you know... When you're with me, you can let me spoil you a little. After all, I'm everyone's onee-san, you know.  
**Mai:** Onee-san...  
**Chie:** That's it, Yanase-san, is there something you want to eat we should put on the menu?  
**Mai:** I'll eat anything, so I'm happiest just cooking the others what they want.  
**Chie:** You shouldn't be so selfless. We want you to enjoy the party too, Yanase-san.  
**Chie:** Can you keep it a secret between the two of us? There must be something you want to eat, isn't there, Mai-chan?  
**Mai:** (Somehow... When Setouchi-chan says it like that, I feel like letting her spoil me...)  
**Mai:** What I want to eat... Then, maybe hamburg steak or omelette rice. My family always tries to eat healthy, so we mostly eat Japanese dishes, but sometimes I feel like eating those.  
**Chie:** In that case, I'll make a special hamburg steak for you, Mai-chan. Look forward to it.  
**Mai:** Thank you so much\! Chie-san.  

## 5: The Strongest Cosplay?
**Mihono:** We can't let these aradama ruin a fun Halloween. We have to beat every last one of them\!  
**Kanami:** Yeah. There's a party waiting for us when we get back, so let's give it our all\!  
**Sayaka:** We have to be done... Before the feast gets cold.  
**Mihono:** Then, to keep everyone motivated, why don't we talk about ways to enjoy Halloween while we head over there?  
**Kanami:** Sounds good. When you're talking about Halloween, you have to go trick or treating.  
**Sayaka:** Trick or treating... I've heard of it, but what is it?  
**Mihono:** It's a big event on Halloween where you put on costumes and go around to all the houses in the neighborhood, telling them if they don't give you candy you'll play a prank on them. So you threaten them like that and they give you candy.  
**Sayaka:** That sounds like a dangerous event...  
**Mihono:** But that danger is a part of what makes it fun; it's the thrill of Halloween. You can be a ghost, or a witch, or a zombie, and you make a really good costume and walk around town with a bunch of other people. It's so much fun.  
**Sayaka:** Then, what about an aradama costume...?  
**Kanami:** Good idea, Sayaka-chan. I hadn't thought of that.  
**Mihono:** If you made it look real, it'd definitely scare a lot of people. That could work.  
**Kanami:** Alright\! Let's hurry up and see the real thing so we can get some ideas.  
**Mihono:** Yeah. I'm getting fired up\!  
**Sayaka:** The faster I eliminate them, the faster I can eat Mai's cooking.  
**Mihono:** This is the place. Huh? I don't see any aradama...?  
**Kanami:** Looks like they're gone. They disappeared from the spectrum finder too.  
**Yomi:** If you're looking for the aradama, we already eliminated them.  
**Yume:** You onee-sans are too slowww\~\. I cleared them out in a snap\~\.  
**Yomi:** I'm sorry you came all the way out here, but it's taken care of, so you're free to go.  
**Sayaka:** Okay. Kanami, Mihono... Let's go.  
**Kanami:** Mm, I'm just glad they were dealt with before anyone got hurt. Though... We didn't get to see the aradama up close, did we...  
**Mihono:** That's right. It's a good thing everyone's safe, but I'm sorta disappointed I didn't get a good look at how they move or what they look like.  
**Kanami:** Oh well, why don't we just try drawing an aradama from memory?  
**Sayaka:** How will we draw it?  
**Mihono:** There's a nice patch of dirt over here, so if we get a stick we can draw on the ground. Let's see, I'll start with the outline... Does that look good?  
**Kanami:** Hmm, it's more jagged than that, isn't it? And the eyes would be around here, wouldn't they?  
**Mihono:** No wayyy, they stick further out, right? As for the legs... How about that?  
**Kanami:** Good, that's it\! ...I think, but, umm...  
**Sayaka:** Is that an aradama? It doesn't look like one at all...  
**Mihono:** We're always fighting them, but now that I try to picture one, I can't get it right.  
**Yume:** Onee-san, what're you doing?  
**Mihono:** Tsubakuro-san\! We were trying to remember what an aradama looks like and draw one. But it's tougher than it sounds, making it look good.  
**Yume:** Why would you wanna draw an aradama\~\? You could be drawing something way cuter\~\.  
**Kanami:** We were going to make Halloween costume. So we were thinking, if we dressed up like an aradama, it'd totally scare everyone.  
**Yume:** Eh\! A Halloween costume? That sounds like fun\!  
**Yomi:** Sigh...  

## 6: The Elite Guard's Halloween
Several hours before Yume and Yomi encountered Kanami and the others, they were--

  
**Yume:** Why are we stuck at home again\~\? It's so boring\~\! Yomi onee-sannn, let's go play outside\~\.  
**Yomi:** Tsubakuro-san, remaining on alert is an important duty. As members of the elite guard, we could be called upon at any moment, so we must always be ready to act.  
**Yume:** Geez\~, I know that already. But it's so lame doing nothing but housesitting every single day\~\!  
**Yomi:** Even so, we cannot abandon a mission Yukari-sama has given us without permission. Why don't you try thinking of a way to cure your boredom without going outside?  
**Yume:** Something fun to do without going outside? If there were something like that, I'd...  
**Yume:** Wait\! I've got it\! Let's have a Halloween party for the elite guards and Yukari-sama\!  
**Yomi:** A party...? That could be difficult. Shidou-san and Konohana-san are out on assignment every day, and Yukari-sama has very little free time.  
**Yume:** Booo\~, just when I had a great idea. You do something about it, Yomi onee-san. I wanna have a party\~\!  
**Yomi:** Even if you ask me, right now, we're the only two in here. I cannot make that happen on my own.  
**Yume:** Mmmm... It's only us two here...  
**Yume:** Ah-\! I came up with a really great idea this time\! Since it's only us two here, that means we can set up a Halloween surprise\!  
**Yomi:** Sigh...  
**Yume:** We can dress up like ghosts, and then we'll scare Yukari-sama and the others, and then they'll give us candy\! It'll be a lot of fun\~\!  
**Yomi:** Like trick or treating... You mean...?  
**Yume:** Yeah, that\! Since that's what we're doing, let's get our ghost costumes ready\!  
**Yomi:** I didn't say we were doing that... In the first place, how are we meant to find ghost costumes in here?  
**Yume:** We've got all sorts of stuff we can use\! Like, what if we take these curtains down and wrap ourselves up in them\~\!  
**Yume:** Look, look, I'm a ghost\~\! Yomi onee-sannn, I'll put a curse on you\~\! But only if you don't give me candy-\!  
**Yomi:** ...  
**Yume:** Hey, Yomi onee-san\! Were you paying attention?  
**Yomi:** Yes. I was watching you, but... Tsubakuro-san, do you really plan on using such a simple costume?  
**Yomi:** I don't mean to disappoint you, but Yukari-sama, Shidou-san, and Konohana-san, who routinely face aradama, won't be scared by something of that level.  
**Yume:** Booo\~\. Then, what should we use?  
**Yomi:** If that's what it takes, I could prepare some actual aradama... Fufufu...  
**Yume:** Wah, don't do that\! When you say it like that, I can't tell if you're joking, Yomi onee-san\~\!  
**Yomi:** Fufu, it was a joke. However, as members of the elite guard, we should be prepared to do whatever it takes to achieve our goals.  
**Yume:** But I want to throw a cuter and happier party than that\! Geez\~\! I thought it was a good idea too, but this is so boring\~\!  
**Yomi:** Tsubakuro-san, where are you going?  
**Yume:** I'm bored, so I'm playing outside\!  
**Yomi:** Sigh...  
**Yume:** Yomi onee-san, big news\! Big news-\!\!  
**Yomi:** You came back quickly. What happened?  
**Yume:** Just now, I heard this from the girls walking outside, but the girls at Minoseki are having a Halloween party, and they're inviting everyone from the other schools\!  
**Yomi:** I see...  
**Yomi:** (Somehow, I don't like the sound of this...)  

## 7: I Want to Go to the Party\!
**Yume:** We should go too, Yomi onee-san\~\! To the Halloween party at Minoseki\~\!  
**Yomi:** Tsubakuro-san, the elite guard exist at all times to serve Yukari-sama. If we were to receive orders now...  
**Yomi:** Excuse me, my phone is ringing.  
**Yomi:** Yes, this is Satsuki Yomi. ...Understood. We will leave at once.  
**Yomi:** Tsubakuro-san, that "if" has come very soon. Aradama have appeared in the nearby hills. We need to go.  
**Yume:** Fufu, those are some unlucky aradama, showing up at a time like this\~\. I'm feeling ready to cut them to ribbons\!  
**Aradama:** GUAAAAAAAAA\!  
**Yume:** EIIIIIII\!\!\!\!  
**Aradama:** OO OOOooo ooo...  
**Yume:** Huhh, was that the last one? They're too weak\~\.  
**Yomi:** That was an even more impressive display than usual, Tsubakuro-san.  
**Mihono:** This is the place. Huh? I don't see any aradama...?  
**Kanami:** Looks like they're gone. They disappeared from the spectrum finder too.  
**Yomi:** ...\!  
**Yomi:** (Those toji are from Minoseki. They might be attending the party Tsubakuro-san mentioned earlier...)  
**Yomi:** (In that case, it would be safest to withdraw before the topic of the Halloween party is brought up... I cannot allow Tsubakuro-san to say she wants to go.)  
**Yomi:** I'm sorry you came all the way out here, but it's taken care of, so you're free to go.  
**Sayaka:** Okay. Kanami, Mihono... Let's go.  
**Yomi:** Tsubakuro-san, we should leave as well. If I remember right, there's still one pudding left for a snack.  
**Yume:** Really\!\? Then we should go home fast. Pudding\~, pudding\~\. Huh? What are those Minoseki onee-sans crowded around? I wonder what they're doing.  
**Yume:** Onee-san, what're you doing?  
**Yomi:** (Ahh, she made contact...)  
**Yume:** Eh\! A Halloween costume? That sounds like fun\!  
**Mihono:** Yeah, we're going to throw a really fun party for sure. Oh yeah\! Do you guys from the elite guard want to come too?  
**Yume:** Can we\!\?  
**Yomi:** Thank you for the invitation. However, it may disappoint you, but as members of the elite guard, we need to be ready at any moment in case Yukari-sama gives us an order...  
**Yume:** I'll call Yukari-sama and ask\!  
**Yume:** Hello? Yukari-sama? I can go to a Halloween party, can't I?  
**Yomi:** T-Tsubakuro-san...\!  
**Yume:** Don't worry, Yomi onee-san will be with me. I'll be a good girl, I promise\! So can't I\~\? Yukari-sama, pleaseee\!\!  
**Yomi:** Sigh...  
**Yume:** Okay, got it\~\! Bye\!  
**Kanami:** What'd Yukari-sama say, Yume-chan?  
**Yume:** As long as Yomi onee-san is there watching over me, she said I can go\!  
**Mihono:** Hooray\! Satsuki-san, you'll come too, right?  
**Yume:** ......Yomi onee-san, come on, come onnn\! I really wanna go to the party\!  
**Kanami:** Satsuki-san, could you just stop by for a little while at least? If a mission comes up, we'll help you deal with it.  
**Mihono:** Chii-nee and Mai are cooking up a tasty feast too. I'm sure they'd want all of you and Yukari-sama to try it, so please just stop by\!  
**Yume:** See, see\~\! They want us to come too\~\! So let's go\~, Yomi onee-sannn\!  
**Yomi:** ...I understand. With Yukari-sama's approval, I'll take you up on your offer for a little while.  
**Yume:** Yes-\!  

## 8: Welcome to the Halloween Party\!
**Mai:** I don't believe it\! Look at all the people here.  
**Chie:** Mihono-chan and the others reached out to everyone they could. Ah, there's even members of the elite guard here.  
**Mai:** It's a good thing we made so much food, isn't it.  
**Kanami:** Mai-chan, it looks like everyone's here.  
**Chie:** Now then, everyone, may I have your attention\! Right now, the organizer of this party, Yanase-san, would like to say a few words.  
**Mai:** Hey, Chie-san\! Where's this coming from, I can't...
