## 1: The "Toji Notes" of 20 Years Ago
**Kaoru:** Sigh, why're we the ones who've gotta sort the books in the library?  
**Ellen:** Didn't you listen to what Sana-sensei was saying? A lot of new books are coming in, so the old ones need to be archived. This is as important a job as any other.  
**Kaoru:** I got all that. But, why us...? And just look at all these old books... Cough... Cough... They're all caked in dust... Cough...  
**Mai:** They sure are. But, while we're here, we should make an effort to clean them off and neatly pack them away. Cough, cough...  
**Mihono:** Right. This is the job we were given, so we should give it our all\! Let's see, history books go in this box, and swordfighting books go...  
**Mihono:** Huh? The box with the swordfighting books is gone\!  
**Kanami:** Hm hmm...  
**Kanami:** Oh wow\! I didn't know that style had that kind of history-\!  
**Ellen:** Kanamin just locked right onto the old swordfighting books, huh.  
**Kaoru:** Ever since I heard we were dealing with old books, I figured this would happen. Still, there's way too many of them. They just keep piling up and up...  
**Kaoru:** Ah, this book\! This is just the book I've been looking for...  
**Mai:** It's very thick, isn't it? It's a compilation of all that author's works.  
**Mihono:** Huh, so you read tough books like that, Kaoru-san...  
**Kaoru:** Nn? Read? When'd I say anything about that?  
**Kaoru:** This thickness, and just the right firmness, it's the exact type I've been looking for this whole time. I'm gonna test it out right away...  
**Kaoru:** ZZZZZZZZZZZ...  
**Mai:** That's more like Kaoru-san: using a book as a pillow for a nap.  
**Ellen:** Kanamin's busy reading, Kaoru's busy sleeping; at this rate, we'll be cleaning up forever\!  
**Mihono:** But Kaoru-san and Kanami look like they're having such a nice time, so I'd feel bad for interrupting them...  
**Mihono:** How about I work hard enough to cover for both of them\!  
**Mihono:** Swordfighting... History... Geography... Literature... And...  
**Ellen:** Wow\! Look at her go\! A mountain of books is piling up around Mihomiho\!  
**Mihono:** Swordfighting, swordfighting, history, swordfighting...  
**Mihono:** Uwah-\! Watch out, book avalanche\~\!  
**Ellen:** Oh my god\! Right after you sorted them all\!  
**Kaoru:** Zzzzz... Nn? What's so noisy...  
**Kaoru:** ...Hey\! Why're all the books on the floor.  
**Mihono:** Wahh, I'm sorry-\!  
**Kanami:** I'm the one who should be sorry, Mihono-chan. I shouldn't have been getting lost in books like that. I'll try harder too.  
**Mihono:** Thanks, Kanami\!  
**Mihono:** Then, all the books on the floor here... Huh? Hey, take a look at this\! There's a notebook mixed in here...  
**Ellen:** It says "Toji Notes" on it.  
**Mai:** It seems to be some kind of anthology of notes an older generation of toji left behind for us.  
**Kanami:** Toji Notes... My mom told me about this, a long time ago\!  
**Kanami:** Whenever we'd go to hot springs together, she'd always say "This takes me back" and smile like she was remembering something.  
**Kanami:** When I asked her why, all she would say was, "Instead of hearing it from me, you should find the Toji Notes someday."  
**Kanami:** Ah, I found my mom's notes\! I wonder if she wrote about the hot springs in here...  
**Mihono:** Ehhh-\!\? What's an aradama doing in the library\!\?  
**Aradama:** Keeeeeeee\!  
**Kanami:** Hm...? It's just staring at my mom's notes...  
**Ellen:** Maybe it's interested in what your mama wrote down too?  
**Mihono:** Kanami's mom is even popular with aradama\! She's amazing\!  
**Kanami:** Ahaha, she's not that amazing\~.  
**Kaoru:** This isn't really the time to be screwing around.  
**Aradama:** Keeeeee\!  
**Mai:** Oh, it ran off with the notes...  
**Kanami:** EHHH---\!\? I didn't even get to read them yet-\!\!  
**Ellen:** Even worse\! There's a lot of pages missing\! I think it ran off with a bunch of toji's notes\!  
**Kaoru:** If that ha... If the president finds out, we're screwed...  
**Mai:** It's a one of a kind handwritten notebook. We have to get it back in one piece.  
**Kanami:** Yeah\! I want to find out what my mom was smiling about too\! Let's get those pages back from that aradama\!  

## 2: The Origami Yukari of 20 Years Ago
**Ellen:** We finally got a volume of the notes back. They're from 20 years ago, but the toji's name was... Wow\!  
**Kaoru:** The handwriting's so neat it's actually hard to read... Renpu Senior High School, 2nd year, Origami Yukari... Hang on a sec\! It can't be the Origami Yukari, can it\!\?  
**Kanami:** The head of the Origami family, back when she was our age\! I wonder what she was like then. Let's all read some of it together\!  
**Yukari:** Aren't you feeling tired, Kagari? You've been up night after night training lately. There's no need to push yourself so hard.  
**Kagari:** I'm doing fine. It's simply a part of my duties; living with you as your constant attendant.  
**Minato:** Yukari, Kagari, morning-\! Hey hey, Yukari, do me a favor\! Help me out\!  
**Yukari:** What is it, Minato? You're bowing your head awfully desperately first thing in the morning.  
**Minato:** Let me copy your homework\! I was so tired from training yesterday that I passed out. Just let me copy you this one time, okay? You're cool with that, right, Yukari?  
**Kagari:** I remember hearing the same excuse last week... [mumbled]  
**Yukina:** Yukari-onee-samaaaa\~\!  
**Yukari:** Oh, Yukina...  
**Kagari:** Sigh... I'll take her to our classroom, before she gets her hands on Yukari-sama. Excuse me...  
**Yukina:** Hey, Kagari\! Let go of me\! Yukari-onee-samaaa\~\! Ahhn, wait for meee\~, Onee-samaaa\~\!  
**Kagari:** Give it up already. The first year classrooms are this way. Every morning, you never learn...  
**Minato:** That reminds me, does Kagari have any friends? I never see her with anyone besides Yukina, and I don't know if that really counts...  
**Yukari:** (It's true, Kagari has never once introduced a friend of hers to me. Maybe it's because...)  
**Minato:** Nn? Looks like something's bothering you, Yukari... Is it because... You're worried about Kagari, right?  
**Yukari:** You see right through me. That's right. I think the reason Kagari has no friends is because she's always serving at my side.  
**Minato:** Well, that's just the kind of family you were born into, so there's nothing you can really do... But, I've got an idea on how to fix things\!  
**Yukari:** Fix things?  
**Minato:** I'll be Kagari's first friend\! That way, you'll feel better too, right?  
**Yukari:** Minato...  
**Minato:** Best to strike while it's hot\! Let's take a detour when the three of us go home together today.  
After school that day.

  
**Kagari:** Yukari-sama, why are we stopping by here...?  
**Yukari:** Everyone needs a break sometimes. There's nothing wrong with spending our time after school like ordinary high school girls.  
**Minato:** You heard her. Sometimes, you just have to let loose. Ooh, Kagari, I'll buy you a croquette\!  
**Kagari:** For me? Why would I...  
**Minato:** Ehh, then, what about if I give you half the yakisoba I bought\! Here, say ahhh\!  
**Kagari:** No thank you. Dinner will be ready once we get home.  
**Yukari:** (Even with Minato's friendliness, Kagari refuses to open her heart...)  
**Minato:** Oh, duh\! Every girl loves sweets. Wait here, I'll buy you something delicious.  
**Minato:** And I'm back\~\! Here, have some mamekan. The stuff that shop over there makes is good like you wouldn't believe. Don't just take my word for it, try it.  
**Kagari:** Gulp... If you'll go to those lengths, then fine. But only one bite... Chew chew...  
**Kagari:** It is good...  
**Yukari:** (I've never seen Kagari make such a soft expression before.)  
**Minato:** I told you so, didn't I? Here, I got some for Yukari and me too\!  
**Kagari:** We aren't going to eat all that much... Om om... Chew chew...  
**Minato:** Ahaha, you say that, but you already cleaned it out\!  
**Kagari:** Ah-\!  
**Yukari:** (Fufu, Minato might actually have what it takes to be Kagari's first friend.)  

## 3: The Fujiwara Minato of 20 Years Ago
**Mihono:** There, another volume\! I wonder who wrote this one?  
**Kanami:** Fujiwara Minato... That's my mom\! We finally got it back\~. Okay, let's see what she wrote already\!  
**Minato:** Ahh\~, today's practice wore me out. Wait? Where's Kagari?  
**Yukari:** She's involved with a school event, so we'll be separated today. By the way, I never thanked you for the other day. I knew I could count on you to get Kagari to open up.  
**Minato:** Nah, I still have a long long way to go. Actually, I need a favor from you, Yukari\! Could you help me out a little, so I can get closer to Kagari?  
**Yukari:** Help you? With what?  
**Minato:** When I saw her eating mamekan back then, I realized, if we made Kagari's favorite foods, she'd probably be super happy.  
**Yukari:** I see. I can help with that then. Kagari's favorite foods... How about kenchin soba?  
**Minato:** Kenchin soba\!\? Kagari sure has some refined tastes.  
**Minato:** But, we should at least be able to make that\! Let's try it right after school tomorrow.  
**Minato:** Okay, let's get right to it\!  
**Yukari:** Of course. All the ingredients have been provided by the Origami household.  
**Minato:** Radish, carrot, burdock... Nn? Buckwheat flour\!\? Hang on, Yukari\! Don't tell me you plan on starting at pounding noodles from scratch?  
**Yukari:** Naturally. We said we would be making it by hand. I'll pound the soba, so please take care of the kenchin soup.  
**Minato:** Okay, I'm on it. Let's make kenchin soba so good Kagari won't know what hit her-\!  
**Minato:** Yukari, once this finishes simmering, I'm all done here.  
**Yukari:** Hmph... Hmph... Hmph...  
**Minato:** That's crazy\! The way you're kneading that would put the pros to shame\! Next up is the main event: chopping the noodles. This part's going to take a skilled hand.  
**Yukari:** Don't worry. Leave it to me.  
**Minato:** Wait, a kitchen knife in both hands\! You aren't gonna...  
**Yukari:** TAAAAAH\!  
**Minato:** Dual wielding's cutting the soba up twice as fast\!  
**Yukari:** Phew, now we only need to boil it and we're through here.  
**Minato:** That was incredible, Yukari. I never thought your skills with an okatana would come in handy here...  
**Minato:** It'd be better if we boiled it after Kagari gets here, right? I'll go look for her.  
**Minato:** Kagari-\! Oiii, Kagari, where'd you go-?  
**Minato:** Sorry, Yukari. I looked all over school, but I couldn't find her. Where'd she even go...  
**Minato:** Sigh\~, and we went to all this effort too...  
**Yukari:** Kagari, shouldn't you come out already?  
**Minato:** Huh?  
**Kagari:** You noticed me here, Yukari-sama?  
**Yukari:** Yes, I've had a vague sense you were here for a while now.  
**Minato:** Hey, Kagari\! Were you hiding and watching us this whole time?  
**Kagari:** Yes. It's my duty to always serve at Yukari-sama's side, after all.  
**Minato:** What the heck. So that means, it's no use trying to surprise you either, huh...  
**Yukari:** I went ahead and boiled the soba while you were searching, Minato. Here, let's all eat together.  
**Minato:** Good thinking, Yukari\! Then, you're up first, Kagari. We're pretty proud of how it turned out\!  
**Kagari:** Is that so. I'll try it then. Chew chew...  
**Kagari:** This is delicious... Chew chew... Om om... Chew chew...  
**Minato:** The operation was a total success\! With this, we're friends for sure\!  

## 4: The Hiiragi Kagari of 20 Years Ago
**Mihono:** We read all of Kanami's mom's notes, but that story about the hot spring didn't come up anywhere.  
**Kanami:** Hmmm, I know. I still want to find out... What it was my mom was remembering.  
**Mai:** Maybe there's something written about it in another toji's notes?  
**Kaoru:** That reminds me, in this latest batch we found, there's notes from Hiiragi Kagari in here.  
**Ellen:** Hiiragi Kagari... That's Hiyoyon's mama\!  
**Kanami:** Since my mom wanted to be friends with Hiyori-chan's mom, maybe whatever she was smiling about is in here\! Let's read it\!  
**Yukari:** Kagari, this may seem sudden, but I'm giving you the next two days off.  
**Kagari:** Time off? You know I don't need that. Where is this coming from?  
**Yukari:** I knew you'd react like this. But, breaks are necessary to reliably perform your day to day tasks.  
**Kagari:** If that's what you'd order me to do, of course I'll carry it out... But, with how sudden this is, I'm not sure how I should spend my time off...  
**Minato:** I figured you'd say that, so I already made a reservation for us. Two days and one night at a hot springs inn\! We're leaving tomorrow: you, me, and Ema.  
**Kagari:** Minato-senpai\!\? What are you saying, barging in here out of nowhere... You made reservations without me? You're always like this; always so pushy.  
**Yukari:** What's the harm in it? I'll feel better if you're with Minato and Ema. Take your time in the warm waters and come back feeling refreshed.  
**Kagari:** Kh... If those are your orders, Yukari-sama...  
The next morning...

  
**Kagari:** Why is it only the two of us here? Where's Ema-senpai?  
**Minato:** She said she had to take care of something. But she'll meet up with us later, so it's just us two for now.  
**Kagari:** I see...  
**Minato:** So, how about we break out the bento boxes already\! Chew chew chew.... Nnn, so good\~\! There's something about eating on a train that makes it even tastier.  
**Kagari:** If you say so... Chew chew...  
**Minato:** Come on, act a little excited. If we're done eating, I brought cards\! Let's play old maid\!  
**Minato:** Whoever loses, how about... You have to do an impression of someone close to you? Even you'll take it seriously with that on the line, right?  
**Kagari:** ...I'm not going to compete with you.  
**Minato:** Huh? You know, Kagari, if you back down here, that counts as a loss by default? And what would Yukari think if she found out you were running away from a match?  
**Kagari:** Kh... Even when you're inviting someone, you're so heavy handed. Fine then. All I have to do is win then, is that right? I'll accept your challenge.  
**Minato:** Nice-\! That's a win for me\!  
**Kagari:** Kh, how could I lose...  
**Minato:** Time to hold up your side of the bargain, Kagari. Someone close to you\~ that's gotta be Yukari, right?  
**Kagari:** I-I could never impersonate Yukari-sama.  
**Minato:** But you lost, so I guess you'll just have to give it your best shot.  
**Kagari:** It's true I lost... But, for me to mock the person I serve...  
**Kagari:** ............  
**Minato:** Hurry up, unless you want to wait for Ema to join in so you can have a bigger audience? I promise I'll keep it a secret from Yukari, okay\!  
**Kagari:** (Ah, that's right\! I have another option.)  
**Kagari:** Then, I'll begin my impersonation... Of Yukina, following Yukari-sama every morning on the way to school.  
**Kagari:** Yukari-onee-samaaa\~\! Ahhn, please wait for meee\~, Onee-samaaa\~\!  
**Minato:** Uwah\! You went with Yukina\!\? And you sound just like her too\! Ahahaha\! Way to go, Kagari\!  
**Minato:** Man, I didn't think you'd be so good at this.  
**Kagari:** I've seen it so many mornings that I'm sick of it, after all.  
**Train Announcer:** Last stop\~, this is the last stop\~.  
**Minato:** Ahahahaha, I didn't even notice we were here, I was laughing too hard. You really are funny, Kagari\~. I'm glad we're friends\~\!  
**Kagari:** N-Nobody's ever said that to me before...  

## 5: Finished Reading the "Toji Notes"...
**Kanami:** Wait, Kagari-san's notes only cover up to the train arriving at the station\! Where's the rest?  
**Ellen:** There's no sign that the aradama tore any more pages out, so I don't think there's any more to the story.  
**Mai:** That's right. And each volume has a set number of pages, so I think this might just be the end of it?  
**Kanami:** Then, that would mean, what my mom was remembering was the impression Kagari-san did\!\?  
**Mihono:** It must have been really funny if she was still thinking back to it as an adult. I wish I could've seen it too-\!  
**Ellen:** That solves the mystery of Kanamin's mama, but it makes you want to see what comes next at the hot springs, doesn't it\!  
**Kanami:** I know-\! Looking at notes from the other toji, there's nothing about it.  
**Mihono:** What happened at the hot springs? Did Minato-san and Kagari-san start getting along? Did they have a really good time? I wanna know-\!  
**Kaoru:** You know, if they wrote this much about just the train ride there, I think they had a lot of fun with it.  
**Ellen:** Me too. They were best buddies by the time of the disaster. They must have gotten along on this hot spring trip.  
**Mihono:** Still, it's weird to think that the head of the family and the others were just normal high school girls.  
**Kaoru:** Right? Hiyoyon's mom seems like she'd be just as fun to bully as Hiyoyon herself.  
**Ellen:** And Kanamin's mama seems like a good girl; full of energy and always looking out for her friends\!  
**Kanami:** Ehehe, it's sort of embarassing hearing you say that.  
**Mihono:** Our coach always says, "Toji in the past used to train so hard every day; they never had time to play around," but they totally did.  
**Ellen:** Training is important of course, but you can tell just from reading these that toji in the past enjoyed their school lives too\!  
**Mai:** What if President Maniwa entrusted us with this job because she wanted us to figure that out...  
**Kaoru:** No way. She'd never be that roundabout...  
**Kaoru:** Actually, hang on. The president seems like she'd be bad with that kind of life guidance, so it's actually believable.  
**Kanami:** Either way, we should thank President Maniwa for letting us work in here. Thanks to her, I got to solve a mystery about my mom.  
**Kaoru:** Speak of the devil, she's calling.  
**Kaoru:** Yep, our work's coming along great right now.  
**Kanami:** Kaoru-chan, pass me the phone\! Hello, President Maniwa\! Thanks for giving us such a great job to do.  
**Kanami:** Thanks to you, I had a lot of fun learning what my mom and everyone were like back then\! Here, I'll give it back to Kaoru-chan now.  
**Kaoru:** So anyway, thanks to those notes, we found a good way to waste some time. What do you think; you happy now?  
**Sana:** Kaoru, you seem to think it's none of your business, but you girls are supposed to write your notes in there too.  
**Kaoru:** What? You never told me anything about that.  
**Sana:** Well, that's how it is. So use what's there as a reference and each of you work on preparing your own notes.  
**Kaoru:** Wait, hold up\! Nobody ever said we were going to have to write anything\! Sigh, this annoying work just keeps piling up...  
**Ellen:** Kaoru, that's not all the work we have to do. We were chosen to make up the editorial committee for everyone's notes. That's why we got this job sorting the books.  
**Mihono:** We were\!\?  
**Kanami:** Being the editorial committee means we get to read all the notes before anyone else, right? That sounds like fun\~.  
**Mai:** That's a big responsibility. Let's work hard at it, okay?  
**Kaoru:** Sorting books... Writing notes... Editorial committee... Ahh... I'm feeling lightheaded...  
**Mihono:** Wah, the stack of books fell down-\! Kaoru-san, are you okay\!\?  
**Kaoru:** Haha... That's even more work to do... Hahaha... Even more... More work...
