## 1: Hokuto's Spartan Training
**Suu:** Where should I go with Hokuto-san tomorrow?  
**Suu:** She's finally coming out to Renpu, so it'd be nice if we could have a good time together.  
**Suu:** Though, I'd like to try and make her a fan of Garden or Hell Angel Marvelous-chan... I don't know where to take her-\!  
**Hokuto:** One, two\! One, two\! Swing\! Swing\! Swing\! Swing\!  
**Suu:** (...Right, even I've had times when I was getting overly optimistic...)  
**Suu:** (I should have known... It's Hokuto-san after all. Of course we would end up training...)  
**Hokuto:** Suu\! You're losing focus\!  
**Suu:** R-Right\!  
**Suu:** (How could she tell\!\? But still, my arms are heavy, my legs hurt, I'm straining my back; I can't do this\! I seriously can't do this\!\!\)  
**Suu:** H-Hokuto-san, I might need a break soon, I think...  
**Hokuto:** You've only done a hundred swings so far\!  
**Suu:** Isn't a hundred plenty\!\?  
**Hokuto:** Not yet\!  
**Suu:** (Th-This is bad... If Hokuto-san doesn't get stopped, someone's going to die\! I'm going to die\!\)  
**Suu:** Um, how many practice swings do I have to do for this regimen...?  
**Hokuto:** Don't concern yourself with how many swings you should do, Suu. Swinging until you can no longer raise your arms is your warm-up.  
**Suu:** My warm-up\!\?  
**Hokuto:** Yes, after that comes your real practice swings. Let's see, why don't you start with ten swings after that.  
**Suu:** ......Huh?  
**Hokuto:** Ten swings, and then, if it seems like you can keep going, ten more. Keep repeating that, and you'll find your true limit.  
**Suu:** Isn't that just brute forcing it\!\? What happened to all that stuff you were talking about before, with sports science\!\?  
**Hokuto:** It isn't brute force, it's a function of the brain.  
**Hokuto:** Before you reach your true limit, your brain will send signals saying "I can't go on."  
**Hokuto:** That's why, in order to swing your okatana harder and farther than you can now, you need to drill into your brain that your limit is still even further...  
**Suu:** S-Stop\! That's enough\!  
**Hokuto:** Is it?  
**Hokuto:** Ah, and, I know it might not be interesting only doing practice swings, but don't worry. I'm watching lots of videos to study your Unkou-ryu.  
**Hokuto:** I'll teach you an even more efficient training regimen.  
**Suu:** That's not making me any happier\!  
**Suu:** Let's forget about this and go have fun somewhere\! We finally get to see each other, so I want to enjoy it-\!  
**Hokuto:** ...Seems like there's no way around it. We'll end with this training for today, so, can you give it a good effort?  
**Suu:** Okay\!  
**Suu:** ...Wait, but it's this training that's crazy\!\!  

## 2: On the Cutting Board
**Suu:** Please hide me\! I'm being chased\!  
**Kofuki:** Huh? What?  
**Suu:** Eeeeeeeek\! Aradama-Must-Die-Man\!\? W-W-W-W-Why are you here-?  
**Kofuki:** Hey, you're the one who came barging in. This is my research lab, y'know?  
**Suu:** This place is Shichinosato-san's research lab\!\?  
**Tsugumi:** That's wrong. This is my lab, not Shichinosato-san's.  
**Tsugumi:** So then, what's the matter? You said something disturbing, like you were being chased...  
**Suu:** GYAAAAAAAAAA\!\! She found meee\!\!  
**Suu:** S-Sorry to bother you\~\!  
**Kofuki:** The hell was that about just now.  
**Tsugumi:** She was being chased by Satsuki-san?  
**Yomi:** I finally caught up to you. Please come quietly and participate in the utsushi increasing program.  
**Suu:** I-I don't want to...\!  
**Yomi:** Please participate.  
**Suu:** It really hurts, you know...\!  
**Suu:** It feels like, this is what it must be like to be a carp on a cutting board...  
**Yomi:** Please participate.  
**Suu:** ......Okay.  
**Yomi:** Please apply utsushi.  
**Suu:** I-I can't do it anymore\~\...  
**Yomi:** This is only your seventh time.  
**Suu:** I-I seriously can't do it anymore\!  
**Yomi:** So, once again, you were unable to reach sixteen.  
**Suu:** That just happened by accident\! I'm sure that seven times is my limit\!  
**Yomi:** In the last program, you reached eight.  
**Suu:** Urgh...  
**Yomi:** Seven times is your average. However, the number fluctuates slightly. How can we reliably produce a higher number...  
**Suu:** That's what I'd like to know\!  
**Yomi:** ...  
**Yomi:** (The time she was able to produce sixteen utsushis was when she attempted to stop Asahina-san.)  
**Yomi:** (It seems that motivation is key after all. In which case, this program won't...)  
**Yomi:** (No, if we are able to clearly determine that, then this program does have a purpose.)  
**Yomi:** The next program will be held next week.  
**Suu:** We're still going to keep doing this\!\?  
**Yomi:** Please do not run away next week.  

## 3: To the Ones I Support\!
**Hakobune Noa:** Thanks for coming today, to see Garden's event-\!  
**Suu:** Noa-chaaaaaan\! You're so cute again todayyyyyyyy\!  
**Sonomiya Eden:** We're going to kick things into highest gear today, for all of you who came to see us-\!  
**Suu:** Eden-chaaaaaan\!  
**Tsugumi:** ...? That voice just now, I've heard it before...  
**Suu:** Whoaaaaaaaa\! Garden, you're the bessssssst\!\!\!  
**Tsugumi:** That girl, she's the one who Satsuki-san was chasing, isn't she...  
**Suu:** Garden\! Garden\! Gar... Ah.  
**Tsugumi:** (It seems like she's noticed me as well.)  
**Suu:** .........  
**Tsugumi:** (That's an impressive change of expressions.)  
**Suu:** ...Wh-What a coincidence? You're the one from the lab... with Shichinosato-san, aren't you?  
**Tsugumi:** Ban Tsugumi.  
**Suu:** Th-Thank you for your consideration. I'm Inami Suu.  
**Suu:** Um... Ban-san, are you here for Garden's event too?  
**Tsugumi:** No, that's not it. This is the first I've heard of this "Garden".  
**Suu:** Of course...  
**Tsugumi:** Do you like idols, Inami-san?  
**Suu:** Yes, I like smaller idols a bit.  
**Tsugumi:** Why smaller ones? Is it because you hope they'll develop so they can make it big?  
**Suu:** Hoping they'll develop isn't giving them enough credit\!\! Plenty of the best idols are still working with low popularity\!  
**Suu:** They just... never make it out of obscurity...  
**Tsugumi:** You do hear that the world of idols is a harsh place.  
**Suu:** It is. Garden are on their way to making it big, but most idols disappear without managing to break out.  
**Suu:** That part of it... It sort of connects with me, and I can't help but support them.  
**Tsugumi:** Is that so.  
**Tsugumi:** I'm sorry to interrupt you then. Please do your best to support Garden.  
**Suu:** Ah, how about we do it together?  
**Tsugumi:** No, I have to return to the research lab after this. I'll see you around.  

## 4: Less Than I Thought...?
**Suu:** Sigh... Today's the day of the utsushi increasing program...  
**Yume:** Yomi-onee-saaan.  
**Suu:** -\!\? Th-That voice was... Tsubakuro-san\!\!  
**Suu:** I-I have to hide\!\!  
**Yomi:** What is it, Tsubakuro-san?  
**Yume:** Maki-onee-san and Suzuka-onee-san both went on missions, so I'm bored.  
**Yume:** What are you up to, Yomi-onee-san?  
**Yomi:** I have to now help with Inami-san's utsushi increasing program.  
**Yume:** Inami-san? You mean... The person who's hiding over there?  
**Suu:** \!\?  
**Suu:** (Did she see me\!\? Wait, but... She might just be saying that...)  
**Yume:** How long are you gonna be hiding for? Come out already.  
**Suu:** I-I'm very sorry about that-\! Tsubakuro-sama-\!  
**Yume:** Why're you calling me Tsubakuro-sama?  
**Suu:** No no, you see, the difference between someone like me and you, Tsubakuro-sama, is night and day; I'm like a grain of rice in comparison-\!  
**Yume:** Really? Actually... Have I met you somewhere before?  
**Suu:** (S-So she doesn't remember me after all... But, that's actually pretty lucky\! I might be able to trick her like this\!\!\)  
**Suu:** There's no way we've met before\!  
**Yume:** Hmm. Well, whatever.  
**Yume:** More importantly, hurry up and finish that program thingy already. Yomi-onee-san is going to come play with me\!  
**Yomi:** I never promised I would play with you, Tsubakuro-san.  
**Yume:** Ehh, come on. It'll be fine, right, Yomi-onee-san?  
**Suu:** ......  
**Yomi:** No, it won't.  
**Yume:** Boooo-\!  
**Suu:** (They're sort of like real sisters... So even the monstruously strong Tsubakuro-san can behave like a spoiled little girl too...)  
**Suu:** (If she's like this, maybe she's not that scary...)  
**Yume:** I know\! You just have to finish up that program, right? Then, I'll help you out\!  
**Yume:** I just have to slash up that onee-san, right\!  
**Suu:** Nevermind, she's scaryyyyy\!\!  

## 5: Meeting at the Arcade
**Suu:** Let's go have some fun\!  
**Hokuto:** Where's this coming from, all of a sudden?  
**Suu:** Because, with you it's always training, training, training, training... I want to have fun with you sometimes, Hokuto-san\!  
**Hokuto:** ...Well, you do always put in good effort, so you do need rest every now and then.  
**Suu:** Great-\!\! Let's go right now; let's leave straight away\!  
**Hokuto:** S-Suu\! Don't pull me by the arm\!  
**Suu:** Ah\! Look at that, Hokuto-san\! They have a crane game for Hell Angel Marvelous-chan\!  
**Hokuto:** Marvelous-chan?  
**Suu:** Yeah\! It's an anime that's hugely popular among a subset of people\!  
**Hokuto:** Popular with a subset of people... You like that kind of thing, don't you. Like with idols.  
**Hokuto:** So, are you going to get that doll?  
**Suu:** I will\! Just watch me, Hokuto-san\! I'll get one first try\!  
**Hokuto:** Give it your best shot.  
**Suu:** GAAAAAHHHH\! I can't get it\! The positioning's bad, and anyway, they set up the crane's arm to be way too weak\!  
**Hokuto:** You're getting too worked up, Suu. It's only an anime doll, isn't it?  
**Suu:** Only an anime doll?  
**Hokuto:** ...Suu?  
**Suu:** Anime and games these days aren't for kids\! They have deep dramatic stories too\! It's Cool Japan\!  
**Hokuto:** Eh, ah, uh?  
**Suu:** One more time\!  
**???:** Are those Marvelous-chan dolls\!\?  
**Hokuto:** So there's another person here besides Suu who likes this anime...  
**Kanami:** Mind if I join you\!  
**Hokuto:** -\!\?  
**Hokuto:** (Etou Kanami-san... At the tournament, she was evenly matched with Juujou-san...)  
**Kanami:** Um?  
**Hokuto:** Y-Yes, what is it?  
**Kanami:** Do you like Marvelous-chan too\!\?  
**Hokuto:** Not me, but Suu... The girl playing the crane game likes it.  
**Suu:** I couldn't get it again----\! Uuu... And my spending money is all...  
**Kanami:** Don't worry about it\!  
**Suu:** Eh?  
**Kanami:** I'll get one for you too\!  
**Kanami:** I couldn't get any...  
**Suu:** It's not your fault, Kanami-san\! The arm is way too weak on this crane game\!  
**Kanami:** I know, right, Suu-chan\! It looked like it was about to drop down too\!  
**Hokuto:** Is it really that difficult?  
**Hokuto:** ............  
**Hokuto:** Ah, I grabbed two at the same time.  
**Hokuto:** I got them...  
**Kanami/Suu:** \!\?  
**Suu:** Y-You're amazing, Hokuto-san\!  
**Hokuto:** A-Am I? But, there's no point in me keeping these... Do you want them?  
**Kanami:** Can we have them\!\?  
**Hokuto:** S-Sure.  
**Kanami:** Thanks a lot\!  
**Suu:** I'll treasure it, Hokuto-san\! ...It's so cute, isn't it, Kanami-san\!  
**Kanami:** Yeah, it's really cute\!  
**Hokuto:** ......R-Right.  
**Hokuto:** (I can't see it as anything but a weird doll... Is this what's cute?\)  

## [Suu Joins: Start]: How Many Can You Apply?
**Hokuto:** By the way, Suu, how many times can you apply utsushi now?  
**Suu:** You want to know how many utsushis I can do?  
**Hokuto:** Yes, and whether it's gone up or not... I'm curious.  
**Hokuto:** When you fought with me in Okinawa, you used it sixteen times, didn't you?  
**Suu:** That was just that one time... Wait, Hokuto-san, while we were fighting, were you keeping count of my utsushis?  
**Hokuto:** I heard about it afterward. At the time, I hardly had the attention to spare.  
**Hokuto:** Anyway, how much can you do? Is that your maximum? Or, are you able to apply even more now?  
**Suu:** Umm... If I had to say, that was just a freak occurrence.   
**Hokuto:** A freak occurrence?  
**Suu:** Right...  
**Suu:** I've had to go through utsushi training a few times since then, but, the truth is, I can't really get past seven times...  
**Hokuto:** Suu, you shouldn't hold back.  
**Suu:** I'm trying it seriously\!  
**Suu:** Since they found out I could actually do a lot of utsushis, I'd be more scared to hold back during that training\!  
**Hokuto:** ...Alright, if you say so, then I'll believe you.  
**Hokuto:** Then, do you know the reason why the number of utsushis you're able to apply has decreased?  
**Suu:** Please don't treat that like it's the norm in the first place\! That time was special\!  
**Suu:** But... That's right. It can normally change a little depending on my physical condition, I think?  
**Hokuto:** Change a little? By how much?  
**Suu:** One or two times.  
**Hokuto:** For an ordinary toji, that would be a huge issue, but for you, it's only a little...  
**Hokuto:** Aside from your physical condition, can you think of any other reasons?  
**Suu:** Hmm, I can't really think of anything else.  
**Suu:** Anyway, back then, I was just fighting desperately... Even I didn't know I could use it that many times then.  
**Hokuto:** Desperately...  
**Suu:** Yeah. At that time, I wasn't thinking about anything besides stopping you.  
**Hokuto:** ...Maybe it has to do with feelings.  
**Suu:** Eh?  
**Hokuto:** Let's have a match. We'll recreate the circumstances of that fight.  
**Suu:** .........Huh?  
**Hokuto:** And also... We'd better put both your body and mind in good condition.  
**Hokuto:** We'll do whatever you want. I'll go out with you.  
**Suu:** Huhhhhhhhhhhhhh\!\?  

## [Suu Joins: End]: Date Then Match\!
**Suu:** Here, this way\! It's over here, Hokuto-san\! The ice cream here is so good\!  
**Suu:** Here, say ahhh\!  
**Hokuto:** Ahhh...? I can feed myself... Oh, it's nice and not too sweet.  
**Hokuto:** Though... Is this really all you wanted to do before our match?  
**Suu:** You said you would go out with me and do anything, didn't you-?  
**Hokuto:** You're right, I did.  
**Hokuto:** But, I thought you wouldn't want to fight with me, so I meant it as a fair exchange...  
**Suu:** Then, go on a date with me\!  
**Suu:** So now, let's move on to the next shop\! Their anmitsu is delicious\!  
**Hokuto:** Anmitsu... Then, do they have kuzumochi as well?  
**Suu:** They should definitely have some... Hokuto-san, are you asking because you like kuzumochi?  
**Hokuto:** I do. Haven't I told you?  
**Suu:** You never told me\! We're changing our plans\!\! Let's go find a place selling tasty kuzumochi\!  
**Suu:** Time sure goes fast when you're having fun...  
**Hokuto:** But, after fully enjoying yourself, your body and mind are in good condition, aren't they? Rest time is over. We're resuming your training.  
**Hokuto:** ...Here I come-\!  
**Suu:** -\!\?  
**Suu:** (She's as fast as ever\!\? My first utsushi is already gone...)  
**Hokuto:** I'm not stopping\!  
**Suu:** U-Uwah\!\? Hokuto-san... You're serious\!\?  
**Hokuto:** Of course I am\! HAAAAA\!\!  
**Suu:** KH, ugh\!\? I keep losing utsushis...\!  
**Hokuto:** How long are you going to stand there taking hits? Fight back, Suu.  
**Suu:** -\! E-Even if you say that... I'm doing everything I can here...\!\?  
**Hokuto:** Quit making excuses.  
**Suu:** But...  
**Hokuto:** I won't tell you to defeat me. But, show me how you've grown.  
**Suu:** Hokuto-san... I understand. I'll show you, I'll land a hit on you\!  
**Suu:** HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Hokuto:** Big swings won't cut it\!  
**Suu:** UWAHH\!\?  
**Hokuto:** ...Next is your eighth. Will this be your limit?  
**Suu:** ...I can still apply it\! I can still do it\!   
**Hokuto:** Then... We'll keep going\! HAAAAAAAAA\!  
**Suu:** KH-\!  
**Hokuto:** This makes nine\!  
**Suu:** ([pant pant] My utsushi is about at its limit... I can't keep this up\!\)  
**Suu:** I can be... I can be stronger\!  
**Hokuto:** (Her fighting spirit is different from before...\!\)  
**Hokuto:** Come on then, Suu\!  
**Suu:** HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\!  
**Hokuto:** A good attack... But\!  
**Suu:** I'm not done yet...\!  
**Suu:** ...Ah, but, my utsushi won't...  
**Hokuto:** It seems like this is your limit today.  
**Suu:** Sigh... Nine times... And also, I didn't manage to get in a single hit after all...  
**Hokuto:** There's nothing you could do about that.  
**Hokuto:** Even though I called it a match, neither of us could be as desperate as we were then. It's significant that you were simply able to apply more than seven utsushis.  
**Hokuto:** And also, you've improved since then too, Suu.  
**Suu:** I have\!\? I'm really improving...\!  
**Hokuto:** You are. Which is why, let's do our best training you. I'm going to make it even more intense than it's been so far.  
**Suu:** B-But I don't want that-\!\!

## [Pirate - Suu: Start]: After Eliminating the Aradama--
**Aradama:** AAAAA...  
**Suu:** GYAH\! D-D-Don't come this way, aradama\!  
**Suu:** I mean, Shichinosato-san\!\? Aradama\! There's an aradama\!\? Hurry up hurry up\!  
**Kofuki:** I've got my own to play with here for now\! Either wait it out or do something yourself\!  
**Suu:** Come onnn\~\. You said to leave all the aradama to you; that's why I joined your team\~\!  
**Aradama:** KSHAAAAAAA...\!\!  
**Suu:** ...I-It's coming\!\?  
**Suu:** Uwah\!\? Uwahh\!\?  
**Hiyori:** Honestly... What are you even doing? Calm down and hold your okatana properly. Are you trying to get yourself hurt?  
**Suu:** ...G-Got it\! Thank you so much, Juujou-san\!  
**Kofuki:** So, we took care of the aradama, but why're we still in the amusement park?  
**Mihono:** C'mon, Fukki. You heard Ellen-san, didn't you?  
**Mihono:** We're here cause somebody from the park said we could play on their new attraction to test it out\!  
**Suu:** We're super lucky they're letting us play on it. "Treasures of the Pirates" is really popular, so it has a reputation for being hard to get onto\!  
**Akira:** Dressing up like pirates and going treasure hunting sounds pretty cool.  
**Ellen:** It sets a nice mood, doesn't it-. I want to hurry up and play it\!  
**Mihono:** So anyway, you do it with us, Fukki.  
**Mihono:** Well actually, I already signed us up as the same teams we had when we were stopping the aradama just now.  
**Kofuki/Suu:** ...Don't go deciding that on your own\!/Why did you decide on that for us\!\?  
**Mihono:** Eh-\!\?  
**Suu:** ......  
**Kofuki:** ......  
**Hiyori:** This "treasure map" the park attendant gave us... Seems like some of them are fakes.  
**Suu:** They are. Which is why, sometimes this turns into a game of fighting over "treasure maps" between the other teams  
**Hiyori:** So that's why Ellen and Kiyoka said they'd start searching after they collect all the maps.  
**Kofuki:** What a waste of time... Let's just go to the point marked on the map we've got, and if that's not it, we're done-.  
**Suu:** ......  
**Suu:** (She really... doesn't seem interested in anything besides aradama. Does Shichinosato-san not have any hobbies or anything?\)  
**Kofuki:** ...Nn?  
**Kofuki:** What, you got a problem with that?  
**Suu:** No-\! I think that could work too...\!  
**Suu:** Then, let's go as quickly as possible to the place on the map\!  
**Kofuki:** Oi... Wait a sec. She didn't even look at the map; where's she think she's going?  
**Hiyori:** ...Guess we should go after her.  

## [Pirate - Suu: End]: This Was Supposed to Be All Fun and Games...\!
**Hiyori:** So if we find... a pendant from an ancient pirate treasure before time runs out, we win?  
**Suu:** Yes. It looks like you also get points for stealing other team's maps, but getting a pendant is worth the most.  
**Kofuki:** Aghh... Instead of treasure, could we get some aradama-chan in here\~\.  
**Suu:** No, no, no, no, finding the treasure would be a million times better...\! And besides, didn't you beat plenty of aradama today-?  
**Kofuki:** There were too many of you here, so I got even less to play with-. I'm not even close to satisfied...  
**Suu:** Ehh...  
**Hiyori:** Oi... Look\! Over there.  
**Suu:** Wow... That's a super realistic looking skeleton\!  
**Kofuki:** This must be it. Hey you, go and get the thing.  
**Suu:** Understood-. Inami Suu is setting off-.  
**Aradama:** GYUUU...\!  
**Suu:** GYAAH\!\? Something came out\!\?  
**Suu:** ...A-A-A-Aradamaaa\!\?  
**Kofuki:** ...What\!\? After it\!  
**Hiyori:** I know...\!  
**Kofuki:** Fufufu...\! You're tiny, but you're not getting away\!  
**Suu:** ...Ahh\! Wait, please wait...\! Don't leave me alone in this place-\!\?  
**Mihono:** That's crazy-\! So Fukki, you found the treasure and even beat an aradama?  
**Kofuki:** Sure, but it was so freaking small it was over in seconds.  
**Suu:** You could have come right back then... Why did you leave me there for over ten minutes...  
**Hiyori:** We needed to check around to see if there were any other aradama, just to be sure.  
**Hiyori:** And you had your okatana with you, didn't you?  
**Suu:** I did... In theory, I get what you're saying. In theory...  
**Kiyoka:** Since it was Kofuki-san who said to leave Inami-san behind... she probably wanted to keep the aradama all to herself. She didn't even contact us or anything.  
**Hiyori:** You really get her, Kiyoka.  
**Kofuki:** I wanted to beat some aradama-chan, what's wrong with that? Besides, if this scaredycat was in the boat, it'd be more dangerous with her in the way.  
**Suu:** Ah, that makes sense...?  
**Kofuki:** Next time we're on a mission together, I'll take care of all your ones for you. Then you won't be whining about it, right?  
**Suu:** In that case... sure.  
**Kiyoka:** You can't give in to her, Inami-san.  
**Suu:** Ah...\!  
**Suu:** (I don't even want to be on missions with her in the first place... Am I getting dragged into Shichinosato-san's pace little by little\!\?\)  
**Suu:** (I have to hold tight onto myself...\!\)  
**Suu:** (Though I'm not even sure if I can...)
