Yume and the Ice Magic Sequence
===============================

## 1: I Still Want to Do It, Like Magic\!
Several days after realizing this world was a dream...

  
**Mihono:** Even when you tell yourself it's a dream, focusing on trying to experience your ideal self... This might be tough.  
**Mihono:** I'm thinking about trying to improve my concentration, but, am I really doing it, you know?  
**Kiyoka:** Though... If we don't do it, we won't wake up from this dream, will we...?  
**Erika:** Aren't you overthinking this a little, Mihono, Kiyoka? If you're getting into your ideal state, you should be able to do it even when you're relaxed.  
**Erika:** Take Kanami for example. She's having fun challenging everybody to matches, see?  
**Kanami:** That's cause it's so much fun\!  
**Erika:** And, saying that, I've gone along with her countless times.  
**Angelina:** I stopped by to watch partway through, and they kept going for over an hour.  
**Mihono:** ...Kanami's really something.  
**Kanami:** Erika-san's swordsmanship has this unfamiliar feeling to it, so I just can't help but want to see more\!  
**Yume:** Hmm. Erika-onee-san, are you strong?  
**Erika:** What's that-? You want to go too, Yume?  
**Mayumi:** Chiba-san, you're such a popular girl.  
**Yume:** Nnn, that wouldn't be bad either, but...  
**Yume:** Since this is supposed to be a dream, I wanna try doing something even more exciting\!  
**Erika:** Whoops, I got rejected. So, what kind of exciting things did you have in mind?  
**Yume:** I want to use magic\!  
**Yume:** I know there's magic in the world you onee-sans come from, so maybe I can do it too here, since it's a dream\!  
**Kanami:** You're not giving up on that, huh, Yume.  
**Honoka:** If you could use magic, what sort of things would you like to do, Yume-chan?  
**Yume:** Let me see... Maybe fly in the sky? That'd be fun for sure, and it'd probably feel good to fly wherever you want\!  
**Miyuki:** Flight magic, then. In our world, provided you have enough magic power, we've shown that's a technique many magicians are capable of using.  
**Yume:** You've flown in the sky before\!\?  
**Miyuki:** I have. My first experience with it was highly enjoyable, and I felt proud to be a part of it.  
**Yume:** That's so cool-\! I want to fly too\!  
**Mihono:** That's awesome\! So you really can fly around in the sky-.  
**Yume:** Since it's a dream, if you jumped down from one of the school windows or somewhere up high, maybe you'd start flying-?  
**Yume:** So long as you decide that your ideal self should be able to fly around\!  
**Mihono/Kanami:** Ah-\!\?  
**Maki:** I was wondering what all the excitement was about... Yume... You can't know that for sure, so give it up.  
**Maki:** And, Asakura and Etou. Could you not look at her like she just came up with something genius?  
**Mihono/Kanami:** Ahaha...  
**Yume:** Ehh. It's okay if I'm just going to give it a try, right-?  
**Suzuka:** Yume. We may be within a dream, but you still feel pain here, don't you?  
**Suzuka:** I'm sure that Ban-san has prepared some sort of safety mechanism, but, if worse comes to worst, we can't be certain it won't have an effect on your body or mind.  
**Yume:** Ehhh.  
**Hiyori:** Flying in the air does sound incredible, but I think this dream has a lot of limitations to it.  
**Hiyori:** Even if we wish for it, the aradama won't just up and vanish in an instant. ...[chomp]  
**Yume:** What's that you've got there, Onee-san?  
**Hiyori:** Chocolate mint ice cream... [chomp]  
**Shizuku:** ...[chomp]. Though, I know the feeling of wanting to try something since it's a dream. The magic we use can't do everything, after all.  
**Yume:** ...I don't really want to hear anything from you onee-sans while you're all satisfied eating your dream ice cream though-.  
**Hiyori:** ...Ngh.  
**Miyuki:** Fufu, it seems she's struck a sore spot, Hiyori-san.  
**Yume:** Yeah, yeah. I only wanted to try it a little bit too.  
**Miyuki:** You're just brimming with curiosity, aren't you, Yume-san.  
**Miyuki:** However, even if this dream may seem both real and fantastical, doesn't it seem difficult for anything out of a fairytale to appear, like a house made of candy?  
**Suzuka:** Yes. It's likely just as Shiba-san says; it's unlikely anything can happen that strays too far from our common sense of the world.  
**Maki:** That's how it is, Yume. You'll just have to live with it.  
**Yume:** Grr--\! Fine then\! I'm not going to ask you onee-sans what to do anymore\!  
**Kanami:** Ah... Yume-chan\!\?  
**Maki:** Wait... Yume\!  

## 2: Chasing Yume		[Like in the event's title, Yume isn't written in kanji here, so it could mean both Yume and dreams]
**Mayumi:** This here. It looks like Tsubakuro-san dropped it earlier. I think it's some sort of character keyring.  
**Kanami:** That's the mascot character, Ichigo Daifuku Neko.  
**Honoka:** Ah, now that you mention it, it looks like it has a strawberry daifuku motif. It's cute...  
**Maki:** Yume really likes that character.  
**Maki:** Still... Yume completely blew her top back there.  
**Suzuka:** ...We'll have to think up something else besides simply searching for her.  
**Maki:** Even if we can't go as far as making her fly... So long as we had something else that'll make her happy.  
**Suzuka:** That's just it...  
**Suzuka/Maki:** ...\!  
**Miyuki:** ?  
**Maki:** Sorry to ask you this so suddenly, but... Is there any way you could make Yume happy with your magic? Of course, if it's too difficult, I won't blame you for refusing.  
**Angelina:** You and Suzuka both seem strict on her, but actually... You're very sweet with that girl, aren't you?  
**Maki:** We have to give her a proper warning, but she is something like a little sister to us.  
**Miyuki:** I don't have anything specific in mind now, but, could we think on it a little?  
**Honoka:** You're doing so much for us, so I want to help too.  
**Mayumi:** Let's pitch in for Tsubakuro-san's sake. If we're going to make her happy, we might as well give her a surprise that she can't help but smile with.  
**Suzuka:** Thank you, all of you. If you think of anything at all that you need, please ask us without hesitation.  
**Maki:** Then, Yomi and I will go looking for Yume.  
**Yomi:** ...There's a possibility that Tsubakuro-san didn't give up on trying to fly, after all.  
**Kanami:** I'll help look for Yume-chan too\!  
**Mihono:** Shidou-san, Satsuki-san. I'll go too\!  
**Yomi:** That would be a great help. Thank you very much.  
**Maki:** Then, let's move quick. I'd appreciate if you girls did what you could too.  
**Mayumi:** Of course; you can count on us.  
**Yomi:** ...If she's already left the school, we'll have to go outside.  
**Hiyori:** I thought she might be on the roof or one of the upper floors, but couldn't find anything...  
**Yomi:** Yes. I thought the same thing.  
**Yomi:** Still, I didn't expect this. For you to help with the search.  
**Hiyori:** I was looking where she might jump down. I'm just thinking, when I was talking to her, I should have chosen my words a bit more carefully.  
**Hiyori:** Let's search elsewhere.  
**Yomi:** Right. We should meet up with Shidou-san and the others for now.  
**Maki:** ...You didn't find anything either, Yomi?  
**Yomi:** Unfortunately.  
**Maki:** I see. Then, we'll just have to take things slow and steady.  
**Erika:** We're going to help you too.  
**Erika:** Lina and I looked around this area earlier, but we didn't find her. She wasn't in her room or anything, was she?  
**Yomi:** Thank you very much, both of you. Yes, I just checked there.  
**Angelina:** If we're going to find Yume, I'd like to have some kind of lead first. Do you have anything like that?  
**Maki:** Since she said she wanted to try flying before she ran out, it's possible she might try jumping from somewhere high...  
**Maki:** But, it is Yume we're talking about. She might've also completely dropped that and is doing something else now.  
**Angelina:** I suppose... All we can do now is ask around.  

## 3: I Hope Today's Memories Remain
**Maki:** Was Yume there\!\?  
**Kanami:** Ah, Shidou-san\!  
**Kanami:** From what witnesses said, it looks like Yume-chan was at a souvenir shop around here.  
**Mihono:** But, with this many people around... We can't find her\!  
**Angelina:** It would be a real challenge looking for one person in this crowd. Can you still not reach her?  
**Yomi:** She hasn't replied to phone calls or text messages.  
**Hiyori:** Still, why is she at a tourist place right near Renpu?  
**Maki:** If Yume's given up on trying to fly, that's a relief, but we don't know what she's up to now.  
**Erika:** It'd be weird to go sightseeing somewhere right next to where you usually stay too.  
**Angelina:** Maybe she's curious about finding differences between the dream world and the real world...?  
**Yomi:** Who can say? Though, in Tsubakuro-san's case, I don't think that's very likely.  
**Mihono:** What if she just came here to have fun?  
**Kanami:** Over there; I see Yume-chan\!  
**Yume:** What did you onee-sans come here in a big group for?  
**Yume:** Ah. Were you maybe gonna start doing something fun? If you were, then you should've told me first-.  
**Yomi:** That's not it...  
**Yume:** Then, what? Tell me\!  
**Maki:** We only came out here to find you after you went running off. We weren't planning on doing anything else.  
**Yume:** Ehh... All these people came just to look for me? Why...? Are you sure you weren't doing something else?  
**Erika:** We were worried after you vanished all of a sudden. Especially Maki here. And, what did you come here for, Yume?  
**Yume:** Heh hehh\~. That's because-, this place is selling a limited edition Buddha version Ichigo Daifuku Neko purse\!  
**Yume:** I was suprised they were selling it in the dream\! They haven't actually sold these for real yet.  
**Yomi:** The truth is stranger than fiction... Would that mean that Tsubakuro-san's power of imagination overcame the dream?  
**Angelina:** You really do love that mascot character, don't you, Yume. Is it a daifuku, or a Buddha... I can't even tell.  
**Maki:** Nn? Suzuka's calling me.  
**Maki:** Yeah, we found her just now. Understood. We'll take Yume with us and head there.  
**Yume:** Where are we going?  
**Maki:** I think you'll definitely find this interesting. Let's go.  
**Yume:** Onee-sans, why'd you all come out here for? It doesn't look we're here to swim, and it's a little early, isn't it?  
**Mayumi:** The truth is... Starting now, we're going to put on a quick show of how great magic is for you, Tsubakuro-san\!  
**Yume:** You mean it-\!\?  
**Miyuki:** Yes. Now then, Saegusa-senpai. Let's get started.  
**Yume:** Yume: That's a really big round ball of... ice?  
**Mihono:** That's crazy\! I bet you could make shaved ice for hundreds of people with all that\!  
**Mayumi:** Now it's time for me to show my strengths. --Here goes\!  
**Mayumi:** I'll need your help too, Miyuki-san. I'm depending on you.  
**Miyuki:** Please count on me. --YAA\!  
**Yume:** Now they're chipping away at the big ice with little ice\!\? Hey, what're you making?  
**Angelina:** You'll just have to wait and see, Yume.  
**Yume:** Whoaa-\!  
**Shizuku:** Now for the finishing touch. Honoka, you're up.  
**Honoka:** ...O-Okay\! Just have to light up the finished ice sculpture... There.  
**Yume:** You made a giant Ichigo Daifuku Neko out of ice\!\! Wow wow wow\! It's all sparkling\!  
**Mayumi:** It took a little bit of time, but don't you think it turned out rather well?  
**Yume:** Yeah\! I've never seen one this big before\!  
**Suzuka:** ...Even though it was on short term notice, the results are impressive.  
**Yume:** Because of this big Ichigo Daifuku Neko, it sort of feels nice and cool... I know; can I take pictures?  
**Miyuki:** Of course.  
**Mirja:** We hurried over after Asakura Mihono called us, but this truly is an incredible sight.  
**Kiyoka:** Right. I didn't think it would be so elaborately made.  
**Yui:** I'm going to take some pictures of the ice sculpture with Mayumi-san and everyone, to commemorate\!  
**Kiyoka:** You're just using the ice sculpture as an excuse to take their pictures, aren't you...?  
**Yume:** \~ \~.  
**Yui:** \~ \~.  
**Erika:** They seem really happy with it.  
**Mayumi:** It was worth going to the effort.  
**Yui:** Thank you as well, Mitsui-san.  
**Honoka:** This much was nothing at all. It's easy for me to keep it going long enough for Yume-chan to enjoy herself taking photos.  
**Yume:** Ah... But, when we wake up from the dream, these pictures won't be there anymore, will they. I wish they'd be there forever-.  
**Miyuki:** Even so, if we believe they will remain, that might just end up being the case.  
**Kanami:** Miyuki-san's right. Since we're all here, we should take a group photo of everyone in front of the ice sculpture.  
**Mayumi:** That's a great idea, Etou-san\! How about that, Tsubakuro-san?  
**Yume:** I'm totally okay with it-. But, who's going to take the picture?  
**Yui:** I'll take care of it\!  
**Yui:** Go on; everybody bunch up in front of the ice sculpture-. Honoka-san, if I could get you to move a little too please-. I want to capture you in all your glory-\!  
**Honoka:** Okay, I got it.  
**Yui:** If you could get up against the other girls... Just squeeeze yourself right up against them\!  
**Honoka:** Ehhhhhh\!\? S-Squeeze against them\!\?  
**Mirja:** Feel free to disregard her comment just now.  
**Maki:** Isn't this great, Yume.  
**Yume:** Yeah\! Thanks, all you onee-sans\!

## [Mahouka - Suzuka: Start]: Erika's Single Day Experience
**Erika:** Hey hey, Suzuka. What do you normally do?  
**Suzuka:** What I... normally do?  
**Erika:** Yeah, like, most days.  
**Erika:** You and Maki, you aren't students of the Five Traditions like Mihono and them, are you?  
**Suzuka:** To put it simply, our primary duty is acting as escorts for the head of the Origami family.  
**Suzuka:** Of course, that isn't all, and we are engaged in other forms of work...  
**Suzuka:** If you're curious, why not experience some of it for yourself?  
**Erika:** For myself?  
**Erika:** There's no way\! Stuff like student council work just isn't my thing\!  
**Suzuka:** This is different from a student council, so you'll do fine. So, could I ask you to join me throughout the day tomorrow?  
**Erika:** ...Seriously?  
The next day.

  
**Suzuka:** Now then, we'll begin our morning duties. Through the morning, we will be doing office work.  
**Erika:** ...There's kind of some crazy stacks of papers here though.  
**Suzuka:** Those are the papers you and I will be processing. I've seen to it that you'll only have simple paperwork, so rest assured.  
**Erika:** There's nothing assuring about this\! I mean, isn't this much paperwork insane enough\!  
**Suzuka:** It may seem that way when you're unused to it, but, after we get started, it will be over before you know it.  
**Erika:** ...Is that how this goes?  
**Suzuka:** Yes, that's how it is.  
**Erika:** Then... I'll give it a shot. I'm the one who didn't turn you down, after all.  
**Erika:** ...There's a whole lot of aradama, aren't there.  
**Suzuka:** Today's reports are on the light side. There are plenty of times we get more than double this.  
**Erika:** More than double\!\?  
**Erika:** You're almost the same age as me, and Mihono and them are even younger... It must be rough.  
**Suzuka:** You don't need to feel pity for us. We chose this for ourselves.  
**Erika:** You did, huh.  
**Suzuka:** That's right.  
**Suzuka:** My, it's that time already.  
**Erika:** Finally-\!  
**Suzuka:** Good work. We've taken care of most of the paperwork, Chiba-san.  
**Erika:** Ah, you're right...  
**Suzuka:** See? All it takes is to put your mind to it.

## [Mahouka - Suzuka: End]: Suzuka and Erika
**Erika:** Hey, Suzuka.  
**Erika:** We spent all morning with our eyes glued to papers, but what'll we do in the afternoon?  
**Suzuka:** This afternoon, we'll be going out to suppress aradama.  
**Erika:** So it's aradama supressing time. I think I'll feel more comfortable with that than paperwork.  
**Suzuka:** Then, let's get going.  
**Aradama:** OOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\!\!  
**Erika:** HAAH\!  
**Aradama:** GUGYAA\!\?  
**Erika:** Suzuka\!  
**Suzuka:** Right\!  
**Aradama:** Oooooo...  
**Erika:** Is that the last of them?  
**Suzuka:** ...Yes, the readings have vanished from my spectrum finder.  
**Erika:** Hmmm, that wasn't even enough for a warmup. Here I thought I'd get to shake off the gloom from this morning.  
**Suzuka:** By the way, what style of swordfighting do you practice, Chiba-san? I don't recognize those movements...  
**Erika:** It's the Chiba style, but that wouldn't exist in this world, does it?  
**Erika:** Where we're from, over half the police force's Special Magical Assault Team graduated from the Chiba dojo. But you don't have a Special Magical Assault Team here either, right?  
**Suzuka:** We don't have that.  
**Suzuka:** It's not exactly a substitute, but we do have a Special Task Team affiliated with the National Police Agency's Special Sword Administration Bureau.  
**Suzuka:** That would be us toji.  
**Erika:** Hmm, so that's how it is... Actually, why'd you ask about my style anyway?  
**Suzuka:** Your tenacity with a sword... I simply thought you could make a fine toji, Chiba-san.  
**Erika:** ...  
**Erika:** Thanks, Suzuka\!  
**Suzuka:** KYAA\!\?  
**Suzuka:** P-Please don't grab onto of me out of the blue like that\!  
**Erika:** Sorry, sorry\! But, that made me happy.  
**Suzuka:** Sigh, you're a hopeless person, aren't you.  
**Suzuka:** Moving on, let's head to the next site.  
**Erika:** Ah, oh yeah. Thinking about the number of aradama appearances, this wouldn't be the end of them, huh.  
**Suzuka:** That's how things are.  
**Suzuka:** ...I'll be depending on you, Chiba-san.  
**Erika:** Okay-\!
