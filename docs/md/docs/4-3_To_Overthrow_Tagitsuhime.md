## 1: Yui's Condition
**Male News Anchor:** In regards to the strange phenomenon affecting the capital, along with the frequent appearances of aradama, Miss Tagitsuhime, as well as the Sword Administration bureau, have yet to make any statement--  
**Sana:** What do you think\?  
**Yukari:** She abandoned them\. Having fully restored herself, Tagitsuhime no longer has any need for Yukina-- for human assistance\.  
**Sana:** She probably never considered\.\.\. That this was always going to happen\.  
**Sana:** Today makes a week since Tagitsuhime opened the gate to the netherworld\.\.\.  
**Yukari:** In these circumstances, the toji dispatched by Minoseki and Heijou have been a great help\. I have to give my thanks to Ema and Iroha\.  
**Sana:** Of course\.  
**Yukari:** How are Etou and the others doing\?  
**Sana:** It's been as hard on them as you'd expect\. \.\.\.Though, since the day after, they've each been working away at aradama suppression missions\.  
**Sana:** The investigation team led by Kitora Mirja is doing the same\. I'm sure they think it's the least they can do\.  
**Yukari:** I see\.\.\.  
**Yukari:** Sana\. I want to place you in direct supervision of the investigation team\. There's something that's concerning me\.  
**Sana:** That won't be an issue, but\.\.\. Who will be in charge of the overall situation\.\.\.\?  
**Yukari:** I have someone in mind\. She was more stubborn than I imagined\. It took great lengths to convince her\.  
**Yuzuki:** I don't want to hear that from you of all people, Yukari\.  
**Sana:** Yuzuki\.\.\. Senpai\.\.\.\!\?  
**Yuzuki:** \.\.\.Could I ask for your cooperation\?  
**Sana:** How could I say no\! The demon that scared even Minato-senpai is back\! The demon\! The devil\! Yuzuki-senpai\!  
**Yuzuki:** W-Was I that bad\.\.\.\?  
**Sana:** But wait, if Yuzuki-senpai is going to be in command of all toji, and I'll be in direct command of the investigation team, what will you be doing, Yukari-senpai\.\.\.\?  
**Yukari:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.My mind is settled\. I'm going to bring this to an end\. What started twenty years ago\.  
**Kanami:** It's been a while since we all got to gather round and have some of Mai-chan's sweets, hasn't it\! I think I'll go with this one\!  
**Kanami:** Wha- this is chocolate mint flavored\!\? Mm, it's actually not bad\! I think I understand why Hiyori-chan gets so worked up about it\!  
**Sayaka/Mai/Ellen:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** Sigh\~\.\.\. Kanami\. Do you seriously think we haven't noticed\?  
**Kanami:** Huh\? Ahh, you mean this other cookie\? Ahaha\! So you spotted me secretly grabbing two, huh\~\!  
**Mai:** Please, just stop, Kanami-chan\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** We all understand, Kanamin\. Just how hard this is for you\.  
**Sayaka:** Even I can tell you're forcing it, Kanami\.  
**Kanami:** Wh-What do you mean, forcing it\.\.\.\? Come on, guys\. Am I really acting that weird\?  
**Kaoru:** You don't have to force yourself to smile if you don't want to\.  
**Kanami:** \.\.\.I told Hiyori-chan\. That it was too much for her on her own, so I'd carry half of it\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** And still\.\.\. When it mattered most, I couldn't reach her\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** I couldn't keep my promise either\.\.\. In the end, Hiyori-chan had to deal with everything by herself\.\.\. I couldn't do anything for her\.\.\.  
**Mai:** Kanami-chan\.\.\. We all feel the same way\.\.\. Okay\?  
**Kanami:** Mai\.\.\. cha\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.She's right\. It's the same for us\.  
**Sayaka:** We couldn't\.\.\. Keep our promise\.  
**Ellen:** I'm sorry, Kanamin\. Something this difficult got forced on you\.\.\.  
**Nene:** Ne\.\.\.  
**Mai:** That's why\.\.\. It's okay, Kanami-chan\. You don't have to hold it in anymore\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** \.\.\.kay\.\.\.\!  
**Kanami:** --I'll be fine now\. Sorry, that I made everything so difficult\.  
**Ellen:** It's not a problem at all\.  
**Sayaka:** Mm\. You're the one always helping us\.  
**Kanami:** Then, on top of that, there's something I want to ask you\.  
**Kanami:** If nothing else, I want to get it back\.\.\. Kogarasumaru\. Hiyori-chan's okatana\.  
**Chie:** President Maniwa\. The gate to the netherworld is only getting wider, isn't it\.  
**Sana:** That's right\. We might not have much time left\.\.\.  
**Sana:** By the way, you might have already found out, but Ayanokouji Martial Arts School's President Souraku has returned to command the situation\.  
**Sana:** And, because of that, I've been given control of your investigation team for the time being\.  
**Chie:** Yes, I understand\.  
**Kofuki:** So\? What'd you call us here for right after you took charge\?  
**Sana:** Right, about that\. I thought Kitora and Musumi would be back by now, but\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Um, before that\! How is Yui doing now\?  
**Mihono:** After she injected herself with that ampoule, we haven't heard anything about her\.\.\. Only that they put her in the hospital\.\.\.  
**Sana:** Yamashiro is still undergoing medical treatment\. From what the doctors said, she made a remarkably fast recovery, but they still haven't approved her release yet\.  
**Sana:** That speedy recovery is probably the effects of the ampoule Yuzuki-senp\.\.\. Commander Souraku came up with\.  
**Yui:** Excuse me\!  
**Mihono:** --Eh-\!\? Yui\!\? Are you alright now\!\?  
**Yui:** Yep\! I'm all better\!  
**Yui:** --Or I wish I could tell you that, but the doctors said I still shouldn't be moving around yet\.\.\. Ahaha\.\.\.  
**Kofuki:** Wait, hang on, you just came running in here now\.  
**Yui:** See\.\.\. I just wanted to see you all so badly, so I went and ignored what the doctors told me\! \.\.\.Teehee\!  
**Sana:** You're a real idiot, aren't you\?  
**Yui:** \.\.\.Please, hear me out, President Maniwa\! They keep bringing toji in, all these girls hurt fighting aradama, one after another into the hospital\!  
**Yui:** When I saw that\.\.\. I just\! I couldn't stay lying around in bed while that went on\!  
**Sana:** You were pretty badly injured yourself, you know\.\.\.  
**Yui:** I'm fine\! Please\! Let me come back to the investigation team\! Let me go on missions\!  

## 2: Kashuu Kiyomitsu and the Asakura Family
**Sana:** Let you back into the investigation team\? Let you go on missions\? You know I'm not going to allow that\!  
**Sana:** Yamashiro\! Didn't the doctor tell you you still shouldn't be up and about\?  
**Yui:** But I can't stand the idea of going back to a hospital bed\! If you don't let me come back, I'll follow the investigation team on my own\! Stalking is what I'm best at\!  
**Mihono:** When she puts it like that, it's pretty convincing\.\.\.  
**Chie:** Yui-chan\. I understand feeling like you can't just sit by, but you need to listen to what the doctors say\.\.\.  
**Kofuki:** I mean, if she's saying she's fine herself, isn't it fine if we let her come with\?  
**Kofuki:** If anything goes wrong, I'll put a stop to it real quick\.  
**Chie:** Kofuki-chan\. You can't go making wild suggestions like\.\.\.  
**Kofuki:** No really, Chichie\. Think about what kinda person she is\. Even if we leave her behind, she's gonna do everything she can to come after us\.  
**Kofuki:** Even if we manage to lose her, she's probably just gonna find some other toji to stick to\.  
**Chie:** Mm\.\.\. You have a point\.\.\. Thinking like that, it might be best to have her with us from the start, where we can keep an eye on her so she doesn't push herself too hard\.  
**Yui:** Kofuki-san\! You believe in how much I can help, don't you\! Thank you so much\!  
**Mihono:** I think what Fukki believes in is the dangerous side of your personality\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Still, I agree with Fukki\. If Yui says she's fine, then I think we should trust her\!  
**Mihono:** Please, I'll ask you too\! Let Yui back into the investigation team\! We'll all look after her the best we can\!  
**Sana:** You'll all look after her\? She's not a puppy\.\.\.  
**Sana:** \.\.\.Sigh\. Fine\. If you're not going to give up on it, I'll allow her back into the investigation team, on one condition\.  
**Sana:** If your commanding officer, Kitora, decides you're struggling to continue fighting, you'll withdraw from the battlefield immediately\. Meet that condition and you're in\. Am I clear\?  
**Yui:** Yes-\! Thank you very much\! And thank you too, everyone\! I'll do everything I can to make up for the trouble I've caused you\!  
**Sana:** It's possible Kitora could decide at any point to deny your place on the team\. If that happens, be sure to do as she says\.  
**Yui:** Wait\.\.\. Come to think of it, why haven't I seen Mirja-san's gorgeous self or Kiyoka-chan's lovable self\?  
**Sana:** That's because, on Kitora's proposal, the two have been taking care of something\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** Kitora Mirja and Musumi Kiyoka have made their return\.  
**Sana:** Kitora, Musumi, good work you two\. You came at just the right time\.  
**Sana:** Ah, Shichinosato\. This is the reason I called you all here\.  
**Kofuki:** Nn\.\.\.\? What's that supposed to mean\?  
**Sana:** Kitora and Musumi were sent out to Kamakura to look through an archive of the Sword Administration Bureau's records\.  
**Chie:** The Sword Administration Bureau's\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Records\.\.\.\?  
**Sana:** So then, Kitora, Musumi\. Did you find anything\?  
**Kiyoka:** Yes\! We found it\!  
**Mirja:** I had arranged for the details to be organized in a separate file and transported here\.\.\. Do you mind if I speak about our findings for now\?  
**Sana:** Go ahead\. That'd save us some time\.  
**Mirja:** In our investigation into the relationship between Kashuu Kiyomtisu and the Asakura lineage, as I suspected, we found a record of an ancestor of Asakura Mihono using Kashuu Kiyomitsu to seal a great aradama in the netherworld\.  
**Mirja:** Though, to be more precise, it is specifically because of its lethal status as a great aradama sealing okatana that it was handed down through the Asakura family for generations, and is currently in Asakura Mihono's possession\.\.\. Or so I believe\.  
**Sana:** Then, to sum it all up\.\.\.  
**Sana:** Kashuu Kiyomitsu, like Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu, could exist in both the netherworld and our world, and potentially strike a fatal blow to Tagitsuhime\.  

## 3: Commence Operation\! (1\)
At roughly the same time, in a separate briefing room--

  
**Maki:** Yukari-sama\.\.\. Have there been any reports about Yomi since then\.\.\.\?  
**Yukari:** \.\.\.We've still heard nothing\.  
**Suzuka:** Is that so\.\.\.  
**Yume:** Yomi-onee-san, where'd she go\.\.\.  
**Yuzuki:** \.\.\.As of today, it's been a week since she was last sighted\. We should prepare for the worst\.\.\.  
**Yume:** Yomi-onee-san would never die that easy\!  
**Kanami:** Excuse us\!  
**Kanami:** I have a request to make\. Please let us sortie\.  
**Yuzuki:** Sortie\.\.\. Do you mean, to go after Tagitsuhime\?  
**Kanami:** Yes\! At the very least, so we can get Kogarasumaru\.\.\. Please let me get Hiyori-chan's okatana back\!  
**Yuzuki:** I see\. And do the other four of you agree on this\?  
**Mai:** I do\!  
**Sayaka:** Please let us go with her\.  
**Kaoru:** The gate to the netherworld is spreading way further, so we can take a look at things while we're out\.  
**Ellen:** Though we might even beat Tagitsuhime while we're at it\!  
**Nene:** Nene-\!  
**Yuzuki:** \.\.\.Fine then\. I'll approve your request to sortie\. But only provided you do whatever it takes to make it back to us\.  
**Yume:** It's no fair that Chidori-onee-san gets to do everything\! President Souraku, let us go sortie too\! I want to save Yomi-onee-san\!  
**Suzuka:** Yume has the right idea\. So long as the possibility exists, we can't give up on her\.  
**Maki:** \.\.\.Commander Souraku\. We wish to sortie too\.  
**Maki:** We have to be there for Yomi-- for our comrade, if at all possible\.  
**Yuzuki:** \.\.\.I understand\. But only on the condition that you suppress any aradama you encounter at ground level\.  
**Maki:** Yes ma'am\! Thank you very much\!  
**Ellen:** It's like the end of the world here\.\.\.  
**Mashiko:** If we lose, that's what it really will be\.  
**Sayaka:** Mai, that's\.\.\.  
**Mai:** Mm, that's where Tagitsuhime is\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** Just watch, Hiyori-chan\.\.\. Kogarasumaru\.\.\. I'll get it back for sure\.  
**Mai:** Is everyone ready\? In this battle, we need to--  
**Kaoru:** No point starting from there now\.  
**Nene:** Ne-\!  
**Ellen:** That's right\! I'm sure we all feel the same way\!  
**Sayaka:** You can count on us, Mai\.  
**Mai:** We're going to cut open a path for Kanami-chan\!  
**Maki:** Leave the aradama on the ground to us\.  
**Suzuka:** Etou-san\. You keep marching straight ahead\.  
**Yume:** \.\.\.Ah\! They're already coming out\!  
**Aradama:** SHAAAAA\!  
**Yume:** It's our job to deal with the aradama\! Maki-onee-san\! Suzuka-onee-san\! Let's go\!  

## 4: Commence Operation\! (2\)
**Yukari:** From this point forward, we will split into two groups\. Etou's group will move with me to Tagitsuhime's location, at the Tokyo Station building\.  
**Kanami:** You're coming with us, Yukari-sama\!\?  
**Yukari:** My experience from being fused with Tagitsuhime could prove useful\. And more than anything, I need to be there to see this through to the end\.  
**Mai:** It would be reassuring having you with us\. Thank you\.  
**Sayaka:** Mai, let's do our best\.  
**Yukari:** The elite guard will eliminate all aradama in the vicinity as they search for Yomi\.  
**Yume:** Sure thing\!  
**Maki:** We'll find her, whatever it takes\.  
**Suzuka:** Yukari-sama, please look after yourself\.  
**Yukari:** Right\. You three do the same\.  
**Yukari:** Now-- Commence the operation\!  

## 5: Kashuu Kiyomitsu's Potential (1\)
**Chie:** Kashuu Kiyomitsu could fatally damage Tagitsuhime\.\.\.\? Do we know that for sure\.\.\.\?  
**Sana:** Let me repeat, it could potentially do that\. The Sword Administration Bureau currently doesn't place that level of importance on Kashuu Kiyomitsu either\.  
**Mirja:** However, there is something that caught my interest\. The other day, when Asakura Mihono suppressed that great aradama, Tagitsuhime suddenly arrived\.  
**Mirja:** It may be possible that she was sensing the potential threat that Kashuu Kiyomitsu posed\.  
**Kiyoka:** But, she left again without doing anything about Kashuu Kiyomitsu\.  
**Kiyoka:** Don't you think that, if Tagitsuhime was fine with leaving Kashuu Kiyomitsu alone, she decided it couldn't be any danger to her\.\.\.\?  
**Sana:** Hm\.\.\. At any rate, with just what we know now, we can't say anything conclusively\.\.\.  
**Kofuki:** That means there's nothing to do but cut Tagitsuhime and see what happens\.  
**Yui:** Nice thinking, Kofuki-san\! It's so simple it's scary\!  
**Sana:** It might be simple, but there's a point to it\.  
**Sana:** On top of that, whether or not Kashuu Kiyomitsu has some special effectiveness against Tagitsuhime, if you girls were to sortie, it would make things a whole lot easier for Etou and the rest\.  
**Sana:** \.\.\.Asakura, what do you think\?  
**Mihono:** --I want to find out\. Whether or not Kiyomitsu can defeat Tagitsuhime\.  
**Mihono:** And more than that, if Kanami is fighting Tagitsuhime, I can't stay here doing nothing\.  
**Sana:** Guess there was no point in asking\. In that case, I'll get authorization from Commander Souraku to let you sortie with Etou's unit\.  
**Mihono:** I won't let you down\!  
**Yuzuki:** So you were in here, Sana\.  
**Sana:** Commander Souraku, I was just about to come get you\. Did you need something from me\?  
**Yuzuki:** Just now, I sent Yukari along with Etou Kanami and her unit after Tagitsuhime\. Along with them, the three elite guards were sent to search after Yomi\.  
**Yuzuki:** With the lack of available toji, the defense of the nearby area has gotten thinner\. I was wondering, if the investigation team is free at the moment, could I ask them to help--  
**Yui:** Ehh-\!\? Kanami and them just left\!\? We're already one step behind-\!  
**Yuzuki:** \.\.\.\? Did something happen\?  
**Sana:** I can explain why later, but these girls want to go after Tagitsuhime too\.  
**Yuzuki:** Are you serious about this\.\.\.\?  
**Yuzuki:** I understand; I'll approve it\. I'll find someone else to handle defense of the area\. \.\.\.I'm counting on you, Kitora\.  
**Mirja:** I won't let you down\!  
**Yui:** Umm, hey\.\.\. Everyone\? I just can't stop thinking, I have to apologize to you, to make things right\.\.\.  
**Yui:** I'm sorry for what I did\!  
**Yui:** You all went out of your way to accept me into the team, and\.\.\. I can't believe I used my okatana against you\!  
**Yui:** When I think about it now, I don't know why I acted like that, like it was normal\.\.\. I can't get it out of my head\.\.\.  
**Yui:** I'm just really sorry\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Yui\.\.\. We get it\! It's all okay now\!  
**Mirja:** Everyone here understands just what sort of effect that brainwashing had\. By no means was it your fault\.  
**Chie:** Yui-chan, nobody blames you for anything\.  
**Kofuki:** Yeah, so quit acting all serious\. Just go back to your usual self\.  
**Kiyoka:** More than anything, I'm just so happy we were able to get you back\.  
**Yui:** You all\.\.\. Thanks\.\.\.  
**Kofuki:** Still, I'm surprised Mirja let Yui come with us just like that\. I was sure she'd put her foot down harder\.  
**Mirja:** Setouchi Chie stated it as, \"that way we can keep an eye on her, to stop her from acting recklessly,\" didn't she\? I agree with that point of view\.  
**Mirja:** However, Yamashiro Yui\. If you do behave recklessly, I will order you to retreat on the spot\. If I determine you are unable to continue fighting, I will make the same order\. Please do not forget that\.  
**Yui:** I won't\!  
**Chie:** With that settled, let's get moving\!  
**Kiyoka:** Wait, look at that\!  
**Aradama:** GGGGAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Yui:** Now's a good time to test out my strength\! Just watch how much I can do\!  
**Mihono:** But don't push yourself too hard, okay, Yui\!  

## 6: Kashuu Kiyomitsu's Potential (2\)
**Kiyoka:** I was worried, after Yui-chan had to stop by the doctor, but\.\.\.  It looks like we don't have to worry about her now\.  
**Yui:** Mmhm\! I guess modern medicine just couldn't compare to my love for Kiyoka-chan\!  
**Kiyoka:** I don't really understand what she's saying though\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** Yamashiro Yui being able to move without difficulty is possibly an effect of the strengthening drug used by the elite guard\.  
**Yui:** Yeah\! I feel just great\! I'm not getting slowed down a bit\!  
**Chie:** Still, be sure you don't do anything to force yourself\. I agree with Mirja: \"if you behave recklessly, you'll retreat on the spot\.\"  
**Kofuki:** --That's enough talking for now\. There's no point in doing this if we don't catch up to Yukari-sama and them before they fight Tagitsuhime\.  
**Mihono:** That's right\! Come on, let's hurry\!  

## 7: This Heat in Me (1\)
**Kaoru:** Come on already, what's with all the aradama here\.  
**Nene:** Ne-\! Nenne-\!  
**Mai:** Kanami-chan\! Go on ahead\!  
**Kanami:** Okay\!  
**Mai:** Yukari-sama\. Please take care of Kanami-chan\.  
**Yukari:** I will\!  
**Ellen:** That's\.\.\.\! Doesn't seem like aradama are our only enemy here\!  
**Ayumu:** --Etou-san\!  
**Kaoru:** Whoa-\! Now the imperial guard are dropping out of the sky too\!  
**Sayaka:** I won't let you\!  
**Ayumu:** Itomi-san\! Please don't get in my way\!  
**Sayaka:** Kanami, keep going\!  
**Kanami:** I got it\!  
**Ayumu:** Why are you stopping me\!\? You don't have anything to do with this, Itomi-san\!  
**Sayaka:** \.\.\.That's not true\. I'm like a senpai to you\.  
**Ayumu:** I know about that\! You ran away, didn't you\!  
**Sayaka:** I just found something more important\.  
**Ayumu:** More important\.\.\.\? What's more important than getting stronger\! Please get out of my way\!  

## 8: This Heat in Me (2\)
**Ayumu:** \.\.\.Why can't, I keep up\.\.\. Not with Itomi-san\.\.\. Or with Etou-san\.\.\.  
**Sayaka:** \.\.\.Now it's my turn to save someone\. You won't cut anything--  
**Sayaka:** With that soulless sword\!  
**Ayumu:** AAHHHHHH\!\!  
**Ayumu:** \.\.\.I think, I finally understand\.\.\. Etou\.\.\. sa\.\.\.  
**Sayaka:** --I've sure you feel this heat in you too\.  
**Ellen:** Saaya\! Great work\!  
**Kaoru:** Looks like we dealt with all the imperial guard here\.  
**Mai:** Let's follow after Kanami-chan and Yukari-sama\!  

## 9: Yomi's Objective (1\)
**Yume:** Hey, hey, where do you think Yomi-onee-san could be\?  
**Suzuka:** If we only knew what Yomi-san was trying to accomplish, we could have some idea\.\.\.  
**Yume:** Ahh, geez\! If we just had Yomi-onee-san here, she could use her searching powers to find Yomi-onee-san\!  
**Maki:** If we had Yomi, we could find Yomi\? Yume\.\.\. Are you even paying attention to what you're saying\.\.\.\?  
**Suzuka:** Though, I understand how Yume must feel\.\.\. Even if the way she expressed it was so contradictory\.  
**Maki:** The elite guard aren't one until there's four of us, right\?  
**Yume:** That's it\! You're good at saying stuff, Maki-onee-san\!  
**Suzuka:** Yume\! Be on your guard\!  
**Aradama:** GRRRUUUUUU\.\.\.\!  
**Yume:** They're here again\! I just wanna find Yomi-onee-san as fast as I can\!  
**Maki:** Eliminating aradama is a part of our mission\. We'll get rid of them quickly so we can continue searching for her\!  

## 10: Yomi's Objective (2\)
**Maki:** Look at that, you two\!  
**Suzuka:** Those are\.\.\. Aradama used by Yomi-san\!  
**Yume:** Then that means, Yomi-onee-san should be somewhere over there\?  
**Maki:** Chances are high that's the case\. Anyway, let's go look\.  
**Suzuka:** The Tokyo Station building is in that direction\. What could Yomi-san be doing there\.\.\.\?  
**Suzuka:** Besides that\.\.\. She wouldn't ordinarily use so many aradama\. Yomi-san\. What could push you this far\.\.\.  

## 11: Why I Fight (1\)
**Chie:** There's so many aradama\.\.\.\! After each one we defeat, another one comes right out\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** We've been fighting aradama constantly since we left, and it feels like we aren't making any progress\.\.\. I wonder if we're actually catching up to Yukari-sama and the others\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** Our only option now is to make every effort believing that's the case\.  
**Kofuki:** The aradama-chan are getting way too excited\. I wish they'd just let us get to Tagitsuhime and I'll play with them later\.  
**Hana:** --Get to Tagitsuhime\!\? What are you up to\!  
**Mihono:** The imperial guard\!\? And\.\.\.  
**Yui:** Hana-san\!  
**Hana:** Yui\.\.\.\!\? Why are you with the investigation team\.\.\.  
**Imperial Guard A:** Did you betray us\!\?  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.This is bad\. If we fight against Suzumoto Hana and the guards here, we'll lose a significant amount of time\.\.\.  
**Yui:** HAAAAAAAAA-\!\!  
**Chie:** \.\.\.Yui-chan\!\?  
**Yui:** Let me handle this; go on ahead\!\!  
**Mirja:** But\.\.\.\!  
**Yui:** I'm just going to hold them off\! I won't push myself too far\! If things get rough, I'll run away\! It's not like I plan on dying either\!  
**Yui:** So keep going\! This is all for nothing if you don't make it to Kanami-chan and them\!  
**Mihono:** Let's go, guys\! Yui's right\!  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.\.\.\.kh\.  
**Kofuki:** We're just wasting time standing here\! Mirja\!  
**Mirja:** Yamashiro Yui\! You have to come back alive\! That's an order\!  
**Yui:** Right\! That's the one order I'll obey no matter what\!  
**Hana:** Yui\.\.\. Traitors have to pay\! You're going to be purged\!  

## 12: Why I Fight (2\)
**Hana:** Th-This isn't right\.\.\. Why is there such a difference in power between you and us\.\.\.  
**Yui:** I got to use something special on myself\. But, just between you and me, the side effects are seriously messing me up\. I can't tell you how bad this thirst is, but it's taking everything I've got to fight it\.  
**Hana:** \.\.\.Yui, why'd you betray us\? Don't you want to see the ideal world Tagitsuhime-sama is creating\?  
**Yui:** Ideal world\? This here is what Tagitsuhime created by opening the gate to the netherworld\.  
**Hana:** It's a necessary sacrifice to create her paradise\.  
**Yui:** That's just selfish reasoning\. When I became a toji, I did it to protect Miku\.  
**Yui:** --Ah, Miku, my little sister who's beyond cute, she caught this kind of complicated disease, so ever since she was little, she's been in the hospital\.  
**Yui:** Miku loves to study, so there's always piles of heavy books in her hospital room\. Her dream is to be a schoolteacher someday\.  
**Yui:** If Miku were healthy, she could easily make that dream a reality\.  
**Yui:** --But her sickness took all her possibilities away from her\.  
**Yui:** I might not be able to cure Miku, but so long as I'm a toji, I can afford to get Miku the best treatment she can have\. That's why I'm a toji\.  
**Yui:** A world that treats Miku\.\.\. The person I'm fighting to protect\! Like a sacrifice\! There's no way that could be a paradise\!  
**Hana:** What are you losing your nerve for now\.\.\.\!  
**Yui:** If we defeat Tagitsuhime, your brainwashing should be broken too\. Then I think you'll understand what I'm telling you\.  
**Yui:** I'm not losing my nerve at all\. This is what matters most to me\. So, until then-- please rest\.  
**Hana:** Urgh\.\.\.  
**Yui:** --Now then\. Honestly, I've been fighting pretty hard to keep going, it hurts like crazy all over, and I think I've got a fever\. But, I'll power through it somehow\!  
**Other:** 1 Lost in Action  
**Sana:** There's nothing abnormal in the vital signs of all the toji sortieing right now\.  
**Yuzuki:** No one's been seriously injured then\. They're doing well for themselves out there\.  
**Sana:** They are\. Makes me wish my younger self could've learned a thing or two from them\.  
**Sana:** Though, this is all because\.\.\.  
**Yuzuki:** I know\. Juujou Hiyori, 1 toji lost in action\.\.\. That's a heavy figure\.  
**Sana:** We can't let that number grow any higher\. We have to get them all the logistical support we can give\.  
**Yuzuki:** Still, times will come that we have to prepare ourselves for\. For those times\.\.\. That's what I'm ready to be commander for\.  
**Sana:** \.\.\.My heart goes out to you\.
