## 1: I Have a Friend, Meow-
**Mihono:** Oh yeah, so what's your friend like, Musumi-san? You said you were close to someone at Heijou.  
**Kiyoka:** She's really energetic, and she loves animals.  
**Chie:** Ah, I'm curious too. Do you mind if I listen in?  
**Kiyoka:** Sure. She's a year older than me though. When we first met, we were on a mission together...  
**Naruse Miki:** We in Naruse Squad will be pursuing the aradama who have fled into the mountains... Hm? Where'd Himeno-san run off to? She was just here a moment ago.  
**Miki:** Hmmm... Musumi-san, could you go look for her? We can't operate effectively if we're all split up\~  
**Kiyoka:** Ah... Okay. I'll try.  
**Kiyoka:** Himeno-saaan... Where are you... Himeno-saaan\!  
**Himeno Shiho:** Shh\! Don't make too much noise\!  
**Kiyoka:** H-Himeno-san...  
	Meow- Meow- Meow- Meow-

  
**Kiyoka:** There's... Kittens...?  
**Shiho:** Aren't they adorable? With the aradama in the area, I felt like I had to keep them safe.  
**Shiho:** But something's not right. I looked around the area and couldn't find their mom anywhere.  
**Shiho:** If we don't find her soon, she might get mixed up in the Special Ritual Squad fighting the aradama, and then...  
**Kiyoka:** What was that...?  
**Shiho:** Just what I was afraid of... That sounds like the aradama... They must be after the mother\!  
**Kiyoka:** How terrible... Himeno-san, we have to get the rest of the squad...  
**Shiho:** I won't let them hurt her\!  
**Shiho:** Pant... Pant...  
**Shiho:** Sorry, Musumi-san. I got carried away and pulled you into that... I'm a failure as a senpai.  
	Meow- Meow- Meow- Meow-

  
**Shiho:** Sorry. When I thought these kittens and their mom could get hurt, I lost control and abandoned the rest of the squad.  
**Shiho:** And even then, I was too late... Their mother...  
**Shiho:** But still, you remind me of those kittens, Musumi-san. Always so weak and innocent... For me to put you in danger like that...  
**Shiho:** That's why... I'm... I'm really sorry.  
**Kiyoka:** Don't be\! You don't have to apologize. I... I don't like to fight... I hate it, but... I understand how you feel, Himeko-san.  
**Shiho:** Thank you. But, for me to run off on my own like this, I'm going to get punished pretty hard, aren't I...  
**Kiyoka:** Umm... Probably...  
**Kiyoka:** ...And that's what happened. After we reunited with everyone else, we both got scolded a lot. But I don't think they were actually mad at us.  
**Mihono:** Ahh, I would have felt the same. You just gotta help out at a time like that\!  
**Chie:** Himeno Shiho-san really loves animals, doesn't she?  
**Kiyoka:** Yes. Whenever I go on missions with Shiho-san, she's always teaching me about what kind of animals live around there... I hate having to fight, but that makes it kind of fun\~\.  

## 2: Do You Like It? Or Do You Hate It?
**Mihono:** Hey, Kiyoka, do you wanna come train with me?  
**Kiyoka:** Me? Are you sure? You could probably find someone better...  
**Mihono:** Well, Chii-nee and Mirja-san were both busy. Plus, I want to find out how strong you really are.  
**Kiyoka:** ...O-Okay, I'll try it.  
**Mihono:** We'll use wooden swords in a three round match. It's not first to two wins, just three whole rounds.  
**Mihono:** ...Here I come\!  
**Mihono:** Eh...? What was that... I couldn't get through\!\?  
**Mihono:** ......  
**Mihono:** ...Then, round two, let's start.  
**Mihono:** Twice in a row... Alright\! This is where it counts\!  
**Kiyoka:** Y-Yes.  
**Mihono:** I'm going to seriously come at you now\!  
**Mihono:** ...I couldn't win a single round in the end.  
**Mihono:** ...What the heck\! I don't believe it\!\? Kiyoka, you're crazy strong\!  
**Mihono:** Honestly, in that last fight, I felt like I put everything into my swings, but it was like hitting a wall. I couldn't break your guard.  
**Mihono:** Ahhh, I feel so weak\! This sucks...  
**Kiyoka:** Um... I-I just... Sor-  
**Mihono:** Stop right there\! You were about to say sorry, right\! You're not allowed to\!  
**Mihono:** Instead, I want you to explain something to me. How can you be that strong but so scared of fighting?  
**Kiyoka:** ......  
**Kiyoka:** Because you could get hurt, and it's scary, isn't it? I mean...  
**Kiyoka:** Even with utsushi on, you can still feel pain. And if utsushi gets broken and you're attacked by an okatana or an aradama, you could die, you know?  
**Kiyoka:** I'm the one who doesn't understand... How all of you can be okay with it.  
**Mihono:** And that's why you avoid fighting?  
**Kiyoka:** ...Yes.  
**Kiyoka:** I love practicing with wooden and imitation swords in the dojo...  
**Kiyoka:** In the dojo, I used to be called a "genius" and "prodigy"... But I don't think I deserved it.  
**Kiyoka:** I just really loved practicing with a sword. As I kept rising through the ranks, everyone had these expectations that I'd go out and fight aradama, and I was sent to the Heijou Institute...  
**Kiyoka:** But... I was useless.  
**Mihono:** When it came to actual fighting, you were frozen in fear?  
**Kiyoka:** Yes.  
**Kiyoka:** To cut someone or be cut by someone else, or to be injured by an aradama... It really scares me. In the end, I just love the practice of martial arts.  
**Kiyoka:** That's why, fighting you now, Asakura-san, was the first time in a long while that I've enjoyed it. I forgot everything else and only focused on our match... So, thank you very much for asking to train with me today.  

## 3: Teruhiro and Kagemitsu
**???:** Hey, hey, you there, from Heijou\!  
**Kiyoka:** Ah, uh, yes\!\?  
**Kiyoka:** W-Who might you be...?  
**Koike Saaya:** Whoops, sorry. It's rare to see someone else from Heijou around here, so I just had to call out to you. I'm Koike Saaya, a third year high schooler at Heijou.  
**Saaya:** Ever since last September I've been interning here; getting on the job training at the prefectural police station. Ah, it's just deskwork though.  
**Saaya:** So are you here to watch the tournament? Wait, if you were here to see that, you'd already... Have gone back...  
**Kiyoka:** K-Koike-san? I-Is something wrong?  
**Saaya:** I might be mistaken, but... Is that Teruhiro?  
**Kiyoka:** Ah, yes. My okatana is Renge Fudou Teruhiro.  
**Saaya:** Ahh... I knew it. It's been so long, but... It doesn't feel real... I'm even tearing up... That used to be my okatana, you see.  
**Kiyoka:** Eh...?  
**Saaya:** Ah, sorry... Meeting the previous owner must be like running into your lover's old ex, huh? It's not really a happy topic.  
**Saaya:** I made this really awkward. Sorry\! Just pretend I didn't say anything.  
**Kiyoka:** No, it's not like that... Um, if you don't mind, I'd like to hear more about that, actually...\!  
**Saaya:** Okay. But first, can you tell me about yourself too?  
**Kiyoka:** ......  
**Kiyoka:** To tell you the truth, Renge Fudou Teruhiro is my second okatana. Originally, I had a different one... Koryuu Kagemitsu. That one chose me first...  
**Kiyoka:** Apparently I had better compatibility with it than anyone else, and so it was officially given to me. I loved it so much too, and thought we'd always be together. But, last fall, it suddenly stopped responding to me...  
**Kiyoka:** It must have been... Because I'm such a weakling, that it ran out of patience. I... I don't like to fight, and so because of that, Kagemitsu just gave up on me.  
**Saaya:** I see. ...Hmm. Can you let me hold Teruhiro?  
**Kiyoka:** Ah, sure, here you go.  
**Saaya:** I just need to borrow him for a minute...  
**Saaya:** ......  
**Saaya:** Mm, I can still do jin'i, and I could even form utsushi a little now. Holding it like this reminds me what it was like to be a toji.  
**Saaya:** Though, it's a little embarrassing to admit, but... As a toji, I was pretty mediocre. Here, you can have him back.  
**Saaya:** ...About three years ago, they found someone more capable of using Renge Fudou Teruhiro than me. At that time, I handed in my okatana and retired from being a toji.  
**Saaya:** It all ended so fast, but I didn't feel like I had any regrets. If anything, doing support work like I am now suits me much better.  
**Saaya:** ...Hey, Kiyoka-chan. Don't you think Teruhiro feels very kind?  
**Kiyoka:** Eh...?  
**Saaya:** After all, even after Koryuu Kagemitsu left you, Teruhiro stayed by your side.  
**Saaya:** Even after I haven't held him in three years, letting me use my powers again was like his way of saying "Welcome back".  
**Saaya:** I'm sure whoever it was that owned him between me and you was helped out by that kindness as well.  
**Saaya:** Can't you feel it? Throughout your whole body, like he's reassuring you, "I don't mind if you're weak."  
**Kiyoka:** Renge Fudou Teruhiro... Doesn't mind...?  
**Saaya:** That's it. So right now, please take good care of him for me. And if you do that, I'm sure you'll grow into a strong woman.  
**Kiyoka:** A strong woman?  
**Saaya:** Yeah, a strong woman who can strike out beautifully with a blade. Teruhiro wants you to grow stronger together.ã€€Strong enough that one day you'll make even Koryuu Kagemitsu jealous\!  
**Kiyoka:** Koike-senpai...  
**Saaya:** Oh, you finally smiled\! Ah\~, but then you'll have two okatana calling after you. You'll have to deal with how tough it can be being popular, Kiyoka-chan\~\.  
**Kiyoka:** Ah... Okay, I'll have to find out\!  

## 4: Chinami's a Beautiful Girl, By the Way (it's a whole pun with Chinami and chinami ni, meaning by the way)
**Mihono:** You're pretty trendy, aren't you, Kiyoka?  
**Kiyoka:** Eh, I-I don't think I am...  
**Mihono:** But you know so much more than us.  
**Kiyoka:** Well, I have a teacher... Or more like, a role model.  
**Mihono:** A friend of yours? What's she like? How'd you meet her?  
**Chie:** Mihono-chan, if you keep asking her questions she won't have time to answer any...  
**Kiyoka:** It's okay. Well, she's...  
**Kiyoka:** I have to get to the school store\! It's going to sell out\! Today's the release of the new monthly issue\!  
**Kiyoka:** And Kamo Chinami-san is on the cover\! I have to get it\!  
**Kiyoka:** I mean...  
**Kiyoka:** Kamo Chinami-san is such a hot topic right now. She's so pretty, and fashionable, and her swordfighting techniques are cool in a cute way, and she's just so beautiful from head to toe.  
**Kiyoka:** Boys fall in love with her and girls want to be like her. It's not surprising that the squad she's in gets chased around by journalists looking to upload new photos to the internet.  
**Kiyoka:** When I think of the word "heroine", without a doubt, it's Chinami-senpai that comes to mind.  
**Kiyoka:** ...That's right. She's the complete opposite of an unappealing girl like me, who's useless at anything that's not in a dojo...  
**Kiyoka:** I made it\! Ah\! And just in time\! There's one copy left\!  
**Kiyoka:** ...I'll take it\!  
*Kiyoka bumps into someone*

  
**???:** Hey, do you mind letting go?  
**Kiyoka:** U-Um\! I-I was here first...\! A-And I always buy this magazine every month\! It's my bible, s-so...  
**???:** Well, I'm in similar circumstances. So we're equally qualified, aren't we?  
**Kiyoka:** I-I can't back down here...\!  
**???:** Then what should we do... For starters, could you stop looking at the floor? C'mon, lift your chin up.  
**Kiyoka:** Um... Ah... Kamo... Chinami-senpai\!\?  
**Chinami:** That's me.  
**Chinami:** So, would you be willing to give me that book? A friend of mine has been dying to get it... Or is it no use?  
**Kiyoka:** Eh, no... This is... It's a misunderstanding... I'm just so nervous I can't let go...  
**Chinami:** ... ....... ..........  
**Kiyoka:** ......  
**Chinami:** You want it after all, don't you?  
**Kiyoka:** N-No, I don't mind if you take it...  
**Chinami:** Really? Is that how you really feel? I think you just don't want to let anyone take what you want from you. Well, that's how a girl ought to be\!  
**Chinami:** I don't think there's anything wrong with that\!  
**Chinami:** Hey, what's your name?  
**Kiyoka:** M-My name...? It's... Musumi Kiyoka...  
**Chinami:** Then I'm Kamo Chinami... But you knew that already, didn't you? Alright then, Kiyoka. You win this one.  
**Chinami:** My friend can just wait for the publisher to send me a copy. Here, you keep this one.  
**Kiyoka:** Eh...?  
**Chinami:** Oh yeah, you said you always buy this magazine? You've got some good fashion sense. That's promising.  
**Chinami:** You just need to start putting it into practice. If you want to be something, you've gotta try being it\~  
**Chinami:** Anyway, I have to get going\! If you ever want any tips about fashion, feel free to ask me, okay? Onee-san here'll give you a total makeover\!  
**Chinami:** See you around\! Bye\!  
**Kiyoka:** And that's how we met.  
**Kiyoka:** I didn't get a chance to apologize to her then, so I went to see her later. And we kept getting closer ever since...  
**Mihono:** It almost sounds like... You got picked up by someone handsome.  
**Kiyoka:** I guess she's my handsome onee-san?  
**Chie:** I've heard of her, Kamo Chinami-san. She does amateur modeling. You're surprisingly well connected, Kiyoka-chan...  
**Mihono:** Is this her femininity in action\!\?  

## 5: Thesis\! What is Femininity\!
**Mihono:** Grrrrrr.... Grr.  
**Kiyoka:** Why are you looking so upset, Hono-chan? That's not like you.  
**Mihono:** Don't act like you're so innocent... (Stare......)  
**Kiyoka:** W-What is it...? When you stare at me like that... I-It's really embarrassing...  
**Mihono:** There\! There it is\! That bashfulness\!  
**Mihono:** It must be nice, Kiyoka\~ Having that much femininity... Meanwhile, I've got none of that...  
**Kiyoka:** There it is\!\!  
**Mihono:** Eh\!\? W-What is...?  
**Kiyoka:** Just now, you said "femininity", didn't you, Hono-chan\!\? What does "femininity" mean to you\!\?  
**Mihono:** What's up with you\!\? It's not like you to be so aggressive, Kiyoka... That scared me.  
**Kiyoka:** Ah... I'm sorry. I'll explain. The other day, Yanase Mai-san and I were baking cookies together, and we got into a discussion about what femininity means.  
**Mihono:** S-So that's why...? Well, femininity means "cute and girly things", doesn't it? You've got a lot of it, Kiyoka. You're cute and make me want to protect you.  
**Kiyoka:** Really, you think I'm cute...? But that's not important right now\! Hono-chan, that way of thinking is wrong\!  
**Kiyoka:** Listen up\! You could say femininity means "for a girl to be alluring while doing girly things"\!  
**Mihono:** O-Okay...  
**Kiyoka:** But, to be more fashionable. To be a better cook. To be more considerate. To be more accepting... There are all kinds of answers, yet all of them are right\!  
**Kiyoka:** That's why... Femininity is something only you can decide on the definition of\!  
**Kiyoka:** For each person to imagine their ideal girl, and then to put in effort making that a reality... That's what "femininity" is all about\!  
**Kiyoka:** Essentially...  
**Kiyoka:** For each and every girl out there, there's a different definition of femininity\! Understand? That's the final answer I've arrived at\!  
**Kiyoka:** (How's that\!\)  
**Mihono:** I-I guess... You have a point there...  
**Kiyoka:** Right? So you could get stronger at swordfighting and become a cooler girl\! That's an ideal\! Thinking like that, practicing swordfighting is a perfectly valid way of raising your femininity\!  
**Kiyoka:** A sword isn't just a way of becoming stronger, but also cuter in a cool way\! In that sense, you're training in two things at once\! If you want to be more popular, you just need to think about what makes a female swordfighter popular in the first place\!  
**Kiyoka:** ...Phew\! Without an ideal to strive for, you'll never express your femininity\!  
**Mihono:** I-I think I get it... An ideal. Okay...  
**Mihono:** (I've never seen Kiyoka like this before. I'm still sort of reeling...)

## [Bride '19: Start]: Undercover Investigation (Kiyoka's Case)
**Yui:** Ehhh\!\? Aradama showed up at the wedding chapel again\!\?  
**Kiyoka:** Mm, it sounds like it.  
**Kiyoka:** Apparently another ring was stolen, so maybe it's the same aradama from before?  
**Yui:** Stealing a ring from a bride-to-be at the happiest moment of her life; Yamashiro Yui, ally to women around the world, won't let this stand\!  
**Kiyoka:** ...Though sometimes, you're their enemy.  
**Yui:** Ahaha, there you go again with your jokes\~\.  
**Kiyoka:** A ha ha ha.  
**Yui:** Kiyoka-chan, your smile's looking a little forced, isn't it-?  
**Kiyoka/Yui:** An undercover investigation?  
**Chapel Staff:** That's right. If one of you acts as a decoy, we can find where the aradama hid the ring, right?  
**Yui:** ...Did you know about this? [whispered]  
**Kiyoka:** No, they only said we'd learn the details when we arrived... [whispered]  
**Chapel Staff:** Um...?  
**Yui:** Ah, it's nothing\! That'll be just fine with us\! Please, just let us handle everything\!  
**Chapel Staff:** We'll be counting on you then. So... Which of you will wear the wedding dress?  
**Kiyoka/Yui:** ......  
**Kiyoka:** (I want to wear a wedding dress\! But, Yui-chan...)  
**Yui:** Hm? What could be on your mind, Kiyoka-chan? Here, don't be shy, let's get you into that dress\!  
**Kiyoka:** But...  
**Yui:** Huh, do you not want to wear it? You like wedding dresses, don't you, Kiyoka-chan?  
**Kiyoka:** I-I do.  
**Yui:** I'm just teasing you. I know what you're thinking. You're worried I'm going to do something weird, right?  
**Kiyoka:** You realized\!\?  
**Yui:** Of course, it's me we're talking about.  
**Kiyoka:** Then... You won't come in while I'm changing?  
**Yui:** I- won't- come- in-?  
**Kiyoka:** Why did that sound so phony\!\?  
**Yui:** Sorry, sorry, I'm just kidding, Kiyoka-chan. I would never force my way in on you while you're changing.  
**Yui:** We're in a wedding chapel after all, so I'll swear to God to keep my word.  
**Kiyoka:** Still...  
**Chapel Staff:** Excuse me, you can lock the waiting room door, so...  
**Kiyoka:** Okay\! I'll dress up as the decoy\!  
**Yui:** That's how little you trust me\!\?  
**Yui:** Fu, fufufu... As if I'd try. Peeping on you while you were changing was never what I was after, Kiyoka-chan...  
**Yui:** It's my chance to see you in a wedding dress, so I have to make sure you get changed first\! Excuse me, Mr. Staffmember\! Could I please borrow a camera\!  
**Chapel Staff:** A... Camera?  
**Yui:** That's right\! I need a camera, to record the aradama from a distance\!  
**Chapel Staff:** Oh, of course\! I'll get you one right away\!  
**Yui:** Now everything's ready to go...\! All that's left is... To wait for Kiyoka-chan\!\!  

## [Bride '19: End]: Shutter Chance\!
**Kiyoka:** Yui-chan really never came...  
**Kiyoka:** There wasn't any sign of her trying to unlock the door, so she wasn't lying.  
**Kiyoka:** Sigh, I should have trusted her more... I was rude to Yui-chan, wasn't I...  
**Yui:** Oh, welcome back, Kiyoka-chan\! You look so good in that wedding dress\! We should get married right away\!  
**Kiyoka:** Thank you... Hey, why do you have that camera\!\? You didn't have it before, did you\!\?  
**Yui:** That's the expression I'm looking for\!  
**Kiyoka:** Answer the question\!  
**Yui:** Why...? The staff here lent it to me.  
**Kiyoka:** Why would they do that\!\?  
**Yui:** All I had to do was say I wanted to record pictures of the aradama, and they handed it right over.  
**Kiyoka:** Of course they would, if you put it like that...  
**Yui:** Pretty quick thinking on my part, huh?  
**Kiyoka:** It's devious...  
**Kiyoka:** KYAA-\!\?  
**Yui:** Got that expression too\! It's so good-, you're so cute, Chan-kiyo\!  
**Kiyoka:** Chan-kiyo...  
**Yui:** But, no matter what, a girl's smile is always best\! Go on, smile for me\!  
**Yui:** And if you'd try flaunting your chest while you're at it, I'd be even happier\!  
**Kiyoka:** Well I'm sorry you can't see my chest unless I flaunt it, okay\!\?  
**Yui:** All breasts, big and small, are beautiful, Kiyoka-chan\!  
**Kiyoka:** That's not making me feel any better-\!  
**Yui:** Hmmm, I thought you'd be acting more embarrassed... Whoopsie.  
**Kiyoka:** Stop trying to embarrass me so you can take pictures...  
**Yui:** I'm just screwing around, you know. Since you do get to wear a wedding dress and all, wouldn't you want some pictures taken?  
**Kiyoka:** You seemed totally serious to me... But, still... This wedding dress is very cute...  
**Yui:** Isn't it? So just leave it to me, your cameraman.  
**Kiyoka:** Yui-chan... Why are you down there on the floor?  
**Yui:** Well I have to take some low angle shots of you, don't I? Don't worry, I'll be sure your panties don't show up in the pictures\!  
**Kiyoka:** Panties...\!\?  
**Kiyoka:** Did you just take a picture of them\!\?  
**Yui:** Relax, the only record of your panties is safe in my memories.  
**Kiyoka:** I don't want that either----\!\!

## [Yuusha 2: Kiyoka: Start]: To Boost Up Our Girl Power\!
**Kiyoka:** This time, the two of us will be suppressing aradama as a pair. You might not be able to rely on me for much... But I look forward to working with you.  
**Fuu:** That's not true at all. I'll be counting on you, Kiyoka.  
**Kiyoka:** ......  
**Kiyoka:** (Th-That's right. A hero like Fuu-san might be helping to clear out the aradama... But this is where a toji like me needs to get it together...\!\)  
**Kiyoka:** Umm... Then, let's give it everything we've got, Fuu-san\!  
**Fuu:** Are you maybe feeling a bit nervous today?  
**Kiyoka:** Ah... No, it's not like that\!  
**Fuu:** Then, that's fine, but it's not good for you to go all out all the time, alright?  
**Fuu:** If you can't show your strength when it counts, you'll be in trouble, won't you?  
**Kiyoka:** You're right about that. To tell the truth... I was feeling like I had to try even harder than usual.  
**Fuu:** That feeling's important too. There's not a single thing wrong with feeling that way.  
**Kiyoka:** How is it you can be so calm, Fuu-san? You're going through so much trouble, coming to our world and then helping us fight aradama, and yet...  
**Fuu:** It's because I'm the leader of the Hero Club. Who's going to follow me if I don't take everything in stride?  
**Fuu:** Though it's not really like that. It's hard for me to put in words, but, well... We're the ones who decided to help out defeating the aradama, and we know we can trust you toji.  
**Fuu:** Anyway, if things get bad, I can just weaken the aradama with my overflowing girl power, so I'll be counting on you to finish them off, Kiyoka.  
**Kiyoka:** Your overflowing... Girl power\!  
**Aradama:** GUGGGGGIIII...\!\!  
**Fuu:** Ah, there they are\!  
**Kiyoka:** Let's go, Fuu-san\!  
**Kiyoka:** ...And so that's what happened. She was a big help, getting me over my strange nervousness and finishing up our mission.  
**Itsuki:** Onee-chan is good at picking up on things like that.  
**Kiyoka:** Fuu-san has a strong sense of leadership, doesn't she. It's a different from Mirja-san, but I found myself depending on her before I knew it.  
**Kiyoka:** On top of that, she's so cool and feminine.  
**Itsuki:** Hmmm... I feel like you're the more feminine one, Kiyoka-san. You know so much about fashion, and the way you accessorize is cute too.  
**Kiyoka:** I'm not that... I still have a long ways to go. I also heard about Fuu-san that her cooking is her specialty.  
**Itsuki:** Onee-chan's cooking is delicious. She does all the chores around home too.  
**Kiyoka:** She's incredible... I really look up to her. I might've wanted to have a big sister like that myself.  
**Fuu:** What do you think, Itsuki? About your reliable big sister you're so proud of.  
**Itsuki:** Come on, Onee-chan. You're letting it go to your head.  
**Kiyoka:** Fuu-san\!  
**Fuu:** Ah, sorry for getting caught up in the moment.  
**Kiyoka:** I... I want to learn to be as feminine as you are, Fuu-san\! Could I ask you to give me special training to raise my girl power...\!\?  
**Itsuki:** Ehh...\!\? Um, Kiyoka-san... I think it would be best if you didn't go there. About Oee-chan's... girl power...  
**Fuu:** I hear your request loud and clear. I don't know how long it will take, but I'll do all I can to help boost your girl power, Kiyoka\!  
**Kiyoka:** Ah, thank you very much... Fuu-san\!  
**Fuu:** The road to improving your girl power is steep and perilous. We'll start your training straight away, Kiyoka\!  
**Kiyoka:** Okay\!  
**Itsuki:** Th-They'll be fine... Probably?  

## [Yuusha 2: Kiyoka: End]: The Key to Raising One's Girl Power is...
**Tougou:** Hey, Itsuki-chan? We just ate a little while ago, so why are Fuu-senpai and Kiyoka-chan sitting in front of bowls of udon?  
**Itsuki:** That's because...  
**Fuu:** There's lots of things that can boost your girl power, like practicing cooking and stuff, but the most effective method is udon\!  
**Kiyoka:** Udon\!\?  
**Fuu:** That's right. Udon is packed with all the ingredients you need for girl power\! And-, with enough girl power, you can do anything-\!  
**Kiyoka:** I-I got it\!  
**Kiyoka:** (I don't exactly understand... why eating udon is meant to make you more feminine. But I just have to have faith in Fuu-san for now.)  
**Fuu:** Now, eat up the udon that's loved by all across the nation, and raise up your girl power\!  
**Kiyoka:** Udon is loved on that kind of level in the world you came from\!\?  
**Fuu:** Sure; udon is at the very tip top of gourmet food. Come on, while it's still hot\!  
**Kiyoka:** I-I'll give it a try...\!  
**Fuu:** [chew chew]... Even in this world, udon's still the best\! ...It's filling me up\!  
**Kiyoka:** Yes... It's very tasty, isn't it\!  
**Fuu:** I think I'll just keep going on into seconds...?  
**Kiyoka:** [chew chew]... A-Already\!\? I-I have to... try harder too-\!  
**Tougou:** Ahh... You can't do that, Kiyoka-chan. If you try to have as many helpings as Fuu-senpai...  
**Fuu:** Thank you for coming along to the Inubouzaki Fuu-style Girl Power Boosting Special Training.  
**Kiyoka:** I'm sorry, but... Fuu-san? We ate udon and then exercised together, but I don't feel like I've gotten any more girl power yet...  
**Fuu:** Girl power is something that exudes on its own. You might not feel it right away, but when you do, you'll know for sure it's gone up. Believe you me\!  
**Kiyoka:** Girl power exudes on its own... You sure know your stuff, Fuu-san.  
**Kiyoka:** I understand then\! Now, let's go and do a good job of suppressing aradama again today.  
**Kiyoka:** Ah\! There's a big park nearby here. I don't want to let the aradama come near it.  
**Fuu:** Of course. We wouldn't want anyone to get hurt.  
**Fuu:** Kiyoka\! I drove it over your way\! I'm counting on you\!  
**Aradama:** ...\!  
**Kiyoka:** --HAAA\!  
**Kiyoka:** The readings from aradama in the area are gone. It seems like that was the last one.  
**Fuu:** Nice job-. Toji sure are something else. You had my eyes glued to the way you were handling that sword of yours.  
**Kiyoka:** It's just really easy to coordinate with you, Fuu-san. So, I sort of feel like I should be thanking you.  
**Fuu:** You don't have to thank me or anything. You're already doing a lot for us. Ah, actually, mind if we stop by somewhere for a bit?  
**Kiyoka:** Wow... It's so pretty here. I've never been to this park before.  
**Kiyoka:** It's a good thing we stopped the aradama from running amok here.  
**Fuu:** That's for sure-. That's another thing you worked hard for, Kiyoka.  
**Kiyoka:** That's not true... It wasn't just because of me.  
**Fuu:** You can't deny you're the one who defeated all those aradama today, can you?  
**Kiyoka:** Somehow, I just felt a little less hesitant today with my swordsmanship.  
**Fuu:** Fu fu fu, don't you get it? That's the proof of your girl power.  
**Kiyoka:** It is\!\?  
**Fuu:** Yep. Now that your girl power's gone up, I'm sure you won't lose to any aradama. Be confident in yourself, Kiyoka.  
**Fuu:** A girl full of confidence is the strongest there is.  
**Kiyoka:** Now that you mention it, attractive girls always seem to have a lot of confidence, don't they.  
**Kiyoka:** Thank you for all you've done for me, Fuu-san.  
**Fuu:** Hm? What do you mean?  
**Kiyoka:** You gave me all that encouragement to help me feel confident in myself.  
**Fuu:** Ahaha-, you noticed, huh?  
**Fuu:** (She caught my interest for some reason, so I might've gone overboard with getting in her business.)  
**Fuu:** Did I overdo it a little?  
**Kiyoka:** Fufu, only when you made girl power sound so all powerful. But, I was very glad for your help.  
**Kiyoka:** I think I'll keep working towards bringing up my girl power from now on\!  
**Fuu:** Mmhm. That's the spirit. You can do it, Kiyoka\!

## [Hostess - Kiyoka: Start]: I'm a Little Bit Nervous for Now...
**Kiyoka:** ......  
**Mirja:** Everyone did well on today's mission. You should all be sure to get some rest.  
**Mihono:** It was rough, going through another day of that many of them-.  
**Kofuki:** It'd be more fun fooling around if there were always that much-.  
**Mihono:** The more aradama there are, the higher Fukki's motivation meter goes up.  
**Mihono:** Oh yeah, we should all get something to eat after this.  
**Chie:** I don't see why not. We got unlucky with our timing and missed a chance to have lunch.  
**Mirja:** We're back at Renpu now, so what next?  
**Kofuki:** It's hot out, so let's just stay at the lounge here.  
**Mihono:** I'd be fine with that. But, Kiyoka, do you know any good places to eat nearby?  
**Kiyoka:** ......  
**Mihono:** ? Kiyoka, are you feeling sick maybe? ...Are you okay?  
**Kiyoka:** Eh.  
**Kiyoka:** Ah... I'm not feeling sick or anything. I just kind of had something on my mind.  
**Mihono:** We were talking about, if we can't come up with anything else, let's eat a late lunch in the lounge here.  
**Kiyoka:** I think eating in the lounge is fine. They just added a new menu a couple days ago too.  
**Mihono:** Then, that's that\! Let's get going\!  
**Kiyoka:** Sigh...  
**Chie:** Your chopsticks are hardly moving. If it's alright, do you want to talk about what's on your mind with me?  
**Kiyoka:** I probably should... Is it alright if you hear me out?  
**Kiyoka:** See, next week... I have to go on the workplace experience trip. And I've been worrying and worrying about whether I can do it right...  
**Kofuki:** What... that's it? Who cares; just do whatever. It's not like messing it up'll kill you.  
**Kiyoka:** Honestly... You're so quick to say things like that, Kofuki-san.  
**Kofuki:** You just worry about stuff too much.  
**Chie:** That's enough, Kofuki-chan. Telling her that isn't going to help her.  
**Mirja:** Where will you be going for your workplace experience, Musumi Kiyoka?  
**Kiyoka:** It's a hotel, or, a ryokan. I'm meant to be working as a hostess... and I'm feeling a little hopeless about it now.  
**Mihono:** Wait, really? If you're going to a ryokan, you'd get to eat yummy food and stuff, so isn't that pretty lucky?  
**Kofuki:** Mihocchi...  
**Kiyoka:** Even if it's only just for that day... If only I could turn into Hono-chan...  
**Mirja:** Even if you can't be Asakura Mihono, it's important that you take a positive outlook like she has.  
**Mirja:** Instead of setting out to do all of your work perfectly, why not just aim to do the tasks you want to do well on properly?  
**Chie:** I agree. I don't think they'll be asking for students getting workplace experience to be perfect at their jobs.  
**Chie:** So I hope, while you're working, you can find something you have fun with and that makes you want to keep at it.  
**Kiyoka:** I'll try thinking about how to have fun with it like Hono-chan would.  
**Mihono:** So wait; it kinda feels like I helped?  
**Kiyoka:** You did, so thanks.  
**Mihono:** You're welcome then\!  

## [Hostess - Kiyoka: End]: Hopefully it Goes Well
**Kiyoka:** Umm, this meal was for the room to the left of the one before--  
**Mihono:** H-Help me, Kiyokaaaaaaaaa\!\!  
**Kiyoka:** ...Hyau\!\? What's the matter, Hono-chan\!\?  
**Mihono:** The food I was making turned into an aradama\!  
**Mihono:** What do I do\!\?  
**Kiyoka:** Ehh\!\? Why did it do that\!\? First... W-W-W-We have to calm down...\!\?  
**Kiyoka:** ...Right\! We use our okatana at times like these\!  
**Mihono:** Oh yeah, our okatana\!  
**Mihono:** This'll do it... in a jiffy\!  
**Kiyoka:** Wait, Hono-chan\! You're holding a fire extinguisher\!\!  
**Mihono:** SHHUU---\!\!  
**Kiyoka:** Ah, everything's gone all white\!\?  
**Mihono:** SHHUU---\!\!  
**Kiyoka:** I can't see the aradama\! Stop it, Hono-chan\!\!  
**Kiyoka:** S-Stop doing that-\!  
**Kiyoka:** ...Oh, huh. It was a dream... Sighh... Thank goodness.  
**Kiyoka:** That weird dream was probably because I keep thinking about the workplace experience. I was even with Hono-chan, even though we're from different schools.  
**Kiyoka:** Maybe I shouldn't have set the AC to shut off on a timer either.  
**Kiyoka:** Let's turn the AC on and go back to sleep.  
**Kiyoka:** So then, I thought I was in the middle of my workplace experience, but at the end... You were shooting a fire extinguisher, and everything went white. It was such a weird dream.  
**Kiyoka:** And it woke me up and I couldn't get back to sleep last night. It gave me a lot of trouble.  
**Mihono:** So that's why you were yawning before. But still, I know it's a dream, but none of that made any sense.  
**Kiyoka:** It's all your fault, Hono-chan-. I mean, how did you turn food into aradama?  
**Mihono:** How am I supposed to know\! That was the just me from your dream\!  
**Kiyoka:** Fufu, sorry. By the way, where did you go for your workplace experience, Hono-chan?  
**Mihono:** For my one, I went to a kindergarten. But it was pretty fun\! I got to play around with the kids, and take a nap.  
**Kiyoka:** You seem like you'd be really good at working with kids, after all.  
**Mihono:** Yeah. We got along great. They told me to come back again, but I'm too busy with missions to stop by.  
**Kiyoka:** ...It'd be a little hard to fit in, wouldn't it.  
**Mihono:** Yeah, with school and missions and all. Maybe if I could take time off from class, but there's no way they'd let me.  
**Mihono:** When you do your workplace experience in 2 days, it might be hard on you, but give it your best shot. I'm sure you'll have fun with it.  
**Kiyoka:** Sure\! I hope I'll get to have as much fun as you did, Hono-chan.
