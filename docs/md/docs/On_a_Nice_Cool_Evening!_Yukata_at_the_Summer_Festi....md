## 1: Festival Excitement, Floating Lanterns
**Yume:**ã€€Wowww-\! There's already so many stands set up\! I can't wait for the festival to start\~\.  
**Yomi:** Tsubakuro-san\. By running around like that, you're obstructing the people constructing stands and transporting goods\.  
**Maki:** Yomi's right, Yume\. We came here with Yukari-sama to lead and the supervise the toji joining in the festival, as part of giving back to the community\.  
**Yume:** Ehhh, but it's boring if that's all we get to do-\.  
**Yume:** Hey, Yukari-sama\~\? After the festival gets started, we can go around and check out whatever we want, right-\?  
**Suzuka:** We aren't here to play, Yume\. Our mission here is simply to patrol the area\.  
**Yume:** Ehh\~\.\.\.  
**Yukari:** So long as you remember not to neglect your patrol, I don't mind if you enjoy the festivities\.  
**Yume:** Okay\! Just leave the patrolling to me\~\. Which stand should I go eat at first\~\?  
**Yume:** Onee-sans, what do you want to go see\?  
**Yomi:** There's nothing I want to see in particular\.  
**Maki:** Can't we just go around seeing whatever you're interested in, Yume\?  
**Yume:** But we're all here at a festival\? You have to have a good time too\! So think about it harder, okay\?  
**Yume:** Ah, that one over there looks good-\! I'll be right back\!  
**Suzuka:** She's been caught up in the festival spirit before we even started\.  
**Yomi:** She said she had gone together with her parents when she was younger\.  
**Maki:** \.\.\.I see\. In that case\.\.\. I guess there's no helping it then\.  
**Maki:** Hm\? Something's causing a commotion over that way\.  
**Festival Prepping Toji:** I-I have a report to make\.\.\.\!  
**Yukari:** What is it\?  
**Festival Prepping Toji:** Aradama seem to have stolen the paper lanterns we used as decorations\! We ourselves spotted several aradama fleeing with lanterns caught on them\.\.\.\!  
**Yukari:** Aradama are taking the lanterns\? What's the meaning of this\?  
**Festival Prepping Toji:** I'm not sure, but\.\.\. The aradama with the lanterns are just marching around the festival area, so it doesn't seem like there's been any serious damage caused yet\.  
**Yukari:** Hm\.\.\. It's a bizarre case, but we can hardly hold the festival if there are aradama here\.  
**Maki:** Yukari-sama, with the help of the toji on patrol, we will clear out these aradama and recover the stolen lanterns\.  
**Yukari:** Good then; include investigating these aradama as part of your mission, and see it done\.  
**Maki:** Yes ma'am\!  
**Yume:** We all came to the festival, so I don't want any aradama going and ruining it\!  
**Yume:** Though, won't it be really annoying getting the lanterns back\?  
**Yomi:** Without the lanterns, the festival's atmosphere will be spoiled\. The pleasant mood of the festival is its greatest charm\.  
**Yume:** Well, if Yomi-onee-san says so, then I'll try not to break the lanterns\.  
**Yume:** Come on, let's go take care of this fast\.  
**Maki:** \.\.\.Wait, don't go on your own\!  
**Suzuka:** I'll guide the civilians away from here and reunite with you later\. Yomi-san, please support the two of them\.  
**Yomi:** Understood\. Then, Yukari-sama\.\.\. I will be going now\.  
**Yukari:** Right, best of luck\.  

## 2: Sharing the Festival with Everyone\!
**Yukari:** Excellent work, not only with suppressing the aradama, but also with directing the other toji\. With your efforts, the situation was put under control before much harm could be done\.  
**Yomi:** The paper lanterns were safely recovered as well\. It may have been delayed half an hour, but the festival should be ready to open shortly\.  
**Yume:** The festival\~, the festival\~\.  
**Yomi:** It seems it's started\.  
**Yume:** Then, let's go-\!  
**Yukari:** Wait, Yume\.  
**Yume:** Ehh\.\.\. But you said I could look around the festival before\~\.  
**Yukari:** I have here yukata for the four of you\. Once you've changed, you may enjoy the festival to the fullest\.  
**Yume:** Wow\! Now it really feels like a festival\!\! Thanks, Yukari-sama\!  
**Yukari:** That's right\. You should thank Yuzuki\.\.\. Ayanokouji's president\. She's the one who prepared these\.  
**Yume:** Okay\! Anyway, I'm gonna go change\!  
**Suzuka:** We should follow along with her\.  
**Maki:** We can't exactly ignore this offer, after all\.  
**Yume:** This takoyaki is yummy\! Yomi-onee-san, I'll give you a bite too, eat up\.  
**Yomi:** Thank you\.\.\. Ohm, mm, it's a little hot\.\.\. Though it is tasty\.  
**Yume:** I told you\~\. I think it's even better than the takoyaki I usually have\?  
**Suzuka:** Fufu\.\.\. On top of shaved ice and chocolate bananas, they're offering buttered potatoes as well\.  
**Maki:** Suzuka\. This came up when you were looking at the food stalls around New Year's, but is buttered potato one of your favorites\?  
**Suzuka:** That's right\. I don't often get to sample them, so the moment I do see them, I always want to have a taste\.  
**Yume:** Ah, you can scoop for goldfish there\! Can I try that\?  
**Yukari:** Fine, go on\.  
**Yume:** You better watch, okay\~\? I'm gonna catch a whole bunch of them\!  
**Yume:** Geez, why can't I catch a single goldfish\~\!\?  
**Yomi:** If you shout so loudly, you'll alert the goldfish\.  
**Yume:** But they keep swimming away as soon as I try\! Hey hey, onee-sans, show me how to do it-\.  
**Suzuka:** Do your best to show her how it's done, Maki-san, Yomi-san\. I will cheer you on\.  
**Maki:** Hey\.\.\. That's no fair, Suzuka\.  
**Yomi:** Understood\. I will give it a try\.  
**Maki:** Kh\.\.\. So Yomi's taking this seriously\. Mister, give me a scoop too\. If I'm going to do this, I don't want to lose\.  
**Yomi:** \.\.\.Then, prepare yourself\.  
**Yume:** Yomi-onee-san\.\.\. How'd you get so good at scooping goldfish\!\? The old guy running the stall looked like he was gonna cry halfway through\.  
**Yukari:** Indeed\.\.\. That's quite the haul\. I was surprised as well\.  
**Yomi:** I may have overdone it\. So I made sure to return some of them\.  
**Maki:** Why\.\.\. couldn't I catch a single one\.\.\.\?  
**Suzuka:** Everyone has their strengths and weaknesses\. You excel at so many other things, Maki-san\.  
**Yukari:** Suzuka\.\.\.  
**Yomi:** You seemed to want these goldfish, Tsubakuro-san, but are you going to look after them\?  
**Yume:** Can I\!\?  
**Yomi:** Though, festival goldfish live very short lives\. Will you keep them regardless\?  
**Yume:** Hmmm\. Even if that's true, since you caught them for me, I'll let them live for a really long time\!  
**Yukari:** It seems the fireworks have begun\.  
**Yume:** Woww-, they're so pretty-\!  
**Suzuka:** Yes, they truly are\.\.\.  
**Maki:** TAMAYA-\!  
**Yume:** What's that\?  
**Maki:** It's something you're supposed to shout when fireworks are going off, though I'm not really sure why\.  
**Yume:** Huh, I didn't know\!  
**Yume:** TA-MAYA-\! This is kinda fun\!  
**Yume:** I hope we get to see the fireworks together again next year-\.  
**Yume:** Ah\! We can all set off fireworks together next time\!  
**Maki:** Fireworks, huh\. It's been a while since I did them myself\.  
**Suzuka:** It wouldn't have quite the same atmosphere as this, but it sounds highly entertaining\.  
**Yukari:** So long as you take proper caution with the fire, I'll allow it\.  
**Yume:** You'll allow it\.\.\. But you'll be doing it with us, Yukari-sama\?  
**Yukari:** I will\?  
**Yume:** We're making a promise\!  
**Yume:** Pinky swear, and whoever lies, they get a needle in their eye\~\!

## [Yukata Yomi: Start]: We Mustn't Get Lost
**Yume:** That yukata really matches you, Yomi-onee-san\. It looks good-\.  
**Yomi:** Thank you very much\. I'm thankful for President Souraku's good judgment\.  
**Yomi:** You look very good in yours as well, Tsubakuro-san\.  
**Yume:** Don't I-\? When I saw it, I thought, President Souraku knows her stuff\! My yukata's so cute\!  
**Maki:** Yume\.  
**Yume:** Eh\.\.\. Wah\!\?  
**Maki:** The crowd's thick\. If you don't look where you're going, you'll bump into someone\.  
**Yume:** Actually, what's with this huge line\!\?  
**Suzuka:** Business is booming\. What could it be for\?  
**Stall Managing Toji:** Ah, the elite guard, with Yukari-sama\.\.\.\! This line is for our yakisoba\.  
**Yukari:** \.\.\.\!  
**Stall Managing Toji:** Yakisoba seemed popular at festivals in the past, so we tried copying that, but this was more than I imagined\.\.\.  
**Yukari:** I see\.  
**Yukari:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Yomi:** Yukari-sama\.\.\. If you'd like some, I could stand in line for you\?  
**Stall Managing Toji:** Yukari-sama herself\.\.\. Wants to try our yakisoba\!\?  
**Stall Managing Toji:** I-I'll bring you some straight away\.\.\.\!  
**Yukari:** \.\.\.No, stop\. The two of you needn't concern yourselves with me\.  
**Yukari:** With all these people in line, I shouldn't be the only one to receive special treatment\.  
**Yukari:** Yomi, you have your duty to patrol and observe the area\. As for the yakisoba\.\.\. That's right\. If any is left over, I will have some then\.  
**Yomi:** As you wish\.  
**Yukari:** Don't let it bother you\. Now then, we'll look around elsewhere\. We have to ensure no one is hurt or in trouble\.  
**Stall Managing Toji:** \.\.\.Y-Yes ma'am\!  
**Yume:** Is Yukari-sama okay with that-\? With how long that line is, won't they run out quick for sure\?  
**Yomi:** If Yukari-sama insists, we shouldn't object any further\.  
**Yume:** Ehh, but she looked like she wanted to have some-\.  
**Maki:** We're going, you two\. We can't allow Yukari-sama to go on ahead by herself\.  
**Yomi:** We can't afford to get lost either\. Will you take my hand, Tsubakuro-san\?  
**Yume:** Guess I don't have a choice, huh\~\. We'd be in a lot of trouble if you got lost, Yomi-onee-san\.  
**Yomi:** Yes, I'll feel better this way\. Let's go join them\.  
**Yume:** Okay\!  

## [Yukata Yomi: End]: Someday, in Memory
**Yume:** Ah, there's this thing with all these little balls floating in the water\! Hey hey, what is this\?  
**Suzuka:** I'm not quite sure what all these balls are for\.\.\.  
**Yomi:** They're for super ball scooping\.  
**Yume/Suzuka:** \.\.\.Super ball\?  
**Yume:** Why are they super\?  
**Yomi:** Their repulsive force is super\. If you throw them against the wall or floor, they bounce off with great force\. And also, the rugby ball shaped ones bounce unpredictably\.  
**Yume:** They sound fun\! I want some\! I can try scooping them, can't I\?  
**Maki:** Fine by me; go ahead\.  
**Yume:** I'll get a whole lot, so I'll give you some too, Suzuka-onee-san\!  
**Suzuka:** Good\. I'll look forward to it\.  
**Yomi:** Allow me to offer some advice before you attempt it\. It's a common misconception, but it's actually harder for the scoop to be broken if you let it fully soak in the water\.  
**Yume:** Wait, really\!\?  
**Yomi:** If only a part of it is wet, it will break more easily\. Also, I suggest not aiming for larger ones and many at once\.  
**Yume:** Thanks for the tips, Yomi-onee-san\.  
**Yomi:** You did it, Tsubakuro-san\.  
**Yume:** Wasn't it way easier than the goldfish though, cause they aren't moving around on their own-\?  
**Yume:** Wait, where's Suzuka-onee-san and Maki-onee-san\?  
**Yomi:** Over there, eating shaved ice\.  
**Maki:** You can't go to a summer festival without trying this\.  
**Suzuka:** Strawberry, melon, lemon, blue hawaii\.\.\. They had so many choices that I couldn't make my mind up\.  
**Maki:** You went with blue hawaii, didn't you\?  
**Suzuka:** I couldn't imagine how it would taste\. I only chose it on your recommendation\. It's sweet and rather good\.  
**Maki:** The only downside is it turns your tongue blue\.  
**Suzuka:** Fufu, and what's wrong with that\? I find that sort of thing funny\.  
**Maki:** I had a feeling you'd say something like that\.  
**Suzuka:** Hey\.\.\.\!  
**Yume:** Ah\! Lucky-\. We should get some shaved ice too\!  
**Yomi:** I agree\. What flavor would you like, Tsubakuro-san\?  
**Yume:** Strawberry\!  
**Yomi:** Understood\. I'll go buy it, so please wait here for a moment\.  
**Yume:** I'll just go with you\!  
**Yomi:** That reminds me, earlier, I saw an Ichigo Daifuku Neko mask in one of the stalls\.  
**Yume:** Wait, you did\!\?  
**Yomi:** Should we go buy that first\?  
**Yume:** \.\.\.Isn't wearing masks sort of for kids-\? I do like Ichigo Daifuku Neko though\.  
**Yomi:** Do you think so\? I think it would be cute if you wore it, Tsubakuro-san\.  
**Yume:** W-Well\.\.\. If you say so, Yomi-onee-san, then maybe we can go look around for it a little, after we get shaved ice\.  
**Yomi:** I think that's a good idea\.  
**Yume:** Festivals sure are fun, huh\.  
**Yomi:** Yes, very much so\.
