## 1: A Picnic for Two\!
**Weatherman:** --The seasonal rain front has been hanging over Japan, but if it continues rising north like this... We expect the rainy season to have cleared up by this weekend.  
**Mai:** (Ah, the rainy season is ending.)  
**Mai:** (We'll finally have some sun for once... What should I do? Of course, I should take care of the laundry that's been gathering up, but it's sort of lonesome if that's all I have planned, isn't it?)  
**Kanami:** Mai-chan, what are you watching on TV?  
**Mai:** Oh, Kanami-chan.  
**Mai:** It's just the weather report. They say the rainy season will clear up this weekend.  
**Kanami:** Really\!\? It feels like it's been raining forever; that's great news.  
**Kanami:** It's not like I don't like rain, but sometimes you just want to go outside and exercise, don't you?  
**Mai:** Sure\!  
**Mai:** ...You know, it's been a while since we had a chance to talk with just the two of us, hasn't it?  
**Kanami:** Now that you mention it... I think it has.  
**Kanami:** It's fun with all of us together, but sometimes I want to hang out with just us two.  
**Mai:** Ah, I've been thinking the same thing\!  
**Mai:** In that case, this weekend... Do you want to go on a trip with me? We could wake up early, and bring bento with us.  
**Kanami:** It's a picnic\!\! Sounds like fun; let's do it, Mai-chan\!  
**Kanami:** Is there anywhere you want to go?  
**Mai:** Where to go... Oh, I know where. There's somewhere I want to take you.  
**Kanami:** Take me? Hmm, where could that be? Tell me, Mai-chan\!  
**Mai:** It's... A secret, until we get there.  
**Mai:** (If Kanami-chan doesn't remember... Then it would be kind of sad.)  
--The day before the picnic.

  
**Mai:** Let's get everything ready for the bento\! Since we're having a picnic and all, I can get a little extravagant.  
**Mai:** Karaage, ginger fried pork, hijiki kinpira. With this many brown colored foods, I should add a side dish of boiled spinach with soy sauce, tamagoyaki with tomatoes, and some Chinese style cucumber salad\!  
**Mai:** After that... Kanami-chan's favorite: natto over rice\! ...I can't make that now though... Oh, right\! I can just set the rice cooker for tomorrow morning... There\!  
**Mai:** Fufu\~. Mr. Teru Teru Bozu, I'll be needing your help tomorrow\~. [teru teru bozu are simple dolls made to pray for a sunny day]  
--The day of the picnic.

  
**Weatherman:** --In what would normally be an unthinkable weather pattern, it seems the rainy season will be continuing over this particular area for a while longer.  
**Mai:** Eh\!\?  
**Mai:** (The rainy season cleared up everywhere besides the spot we were planning to go picnicking at\!\?)  
**Hiyori:** Look at that... The rain front's a total V shape. It's like it got stuck on something there.  
**Kofuki:** Is it cause of the air pressure or something?  
**Mai:** ...Sigh.  
**Mai:** (There's nothing I can do about it. The bento is already made, so I'll search for a place nearby with a good view, and we can go there instead\!)  
**Mai:** (It's a shame I won't be able to take Kanami-chan to that spot though...)  
**Kofuki:** Hey, it's a mission\!  
**Hiyori:** They messaged me too. And...  
**Mai:** ...Oh, that's right, me too.  
**Mai:** Let's see, the members are... Myself, Kanami-chan, Hiyori-chan, Shichinosato-san, and Yui-chan. The five of us will be going... Eh?  
**Mai:** There\!\?  
**Mai:** (I never thought we would be coming here like this...)  
**Kofuki:** GOTCHAAAA\!\!  
**Yui:** Nice going, Kofuki-san\!  
**Kofuki:** Ha ha ha\! Keep the aradama-chan coming-\!  
**Hiyori:** Anyway... With the aradama appearing right where the rain front is sticking around, the rain sure isn't making this any better.  
**Yui:** That's not true, Hiyori-chan\! In fact, with it soaking shirts see through, I say bring on the rain\!  
**Hiyori:** ...You're always like this, aren't you.  
**Kanami:** It's too bad, Mai-chan. We got pulled into this mission all of a sudden...  
**Mai:** I know. But still, our duty as toji is important, so let's set our feelings aside and work our hardest.  
**Kanami:** Right\!  
**Mai:** Though, I did make our bento, so I would at least like to share it today.  
**Kanami:** I'm sure everyone would love to share your bento, Mai-chan\!  
**Kanami:** By the way, isn't this place--  
**Yui:** Huh? Look over here, everyone\! A teru teru bozu came out with the noro\!  
**Kofuki:** Teru teru bozu? Why was that in there?  
**Yui:** I bet the aradama were wishing tomorrow would be bright and sunny too\! ...Just kidding.  
**Hiyori:** No, wait... Look at that\!  
**Mai:** It's brightening up? But, it was pouring rain just a minute ago...  
**Yui:** Fufufu, it's all becoming clear now...  
**Yui:** The reason this place is the only spot where the rain didn't go away is because the aradama stole the teru teru bozu\!\!  

## 2: Clearing Away the Rain and Eating Bento
**Yui:** Fufufu, it's all becoming clear now...  
**Yui:** The reason this place is the only spot where the rain didn't go away is because the aradama stole the teru teru bozu\!\!  
**Kofuki:** Get real.  
**Mai:** (Defeating the aradama gets rid of the rain? Could that actually be the case?)  
**Mai:** (I did see the rain stop with my own eyes though...)  
**Mai:** I'm going to check the weather forecast site real quick.  
**Kanami:** What's it say, Mai-chan?  
**Mai:** I can hardly believe it, but... The weather front moved just a little bit north.  
**Yui:** See\! It's just like I was saying\!  
**Yui:** We have to get back the teru teru bozus, all filled up with everyone's wishes for sunny skies... That's our mission here\!  
**Hiyori:** But, still... What do you think, Mai?  
**Mai:** ...Teru teru bozu have been a tradition since ancient times, so maybe there's some sort of cause and effect happening here...?  
**Hiyori:** Is that how this works...?  
**Kanami:** Ahaha, well, that might be what's happening, so we should try doing like Yui-chan says. People worked hard to make those teru teru bozu, so let's get them back.  
**Yui:** Kanami-chan... I love you\!  
**Kofuki:** Get off of her. It's wet and gross enough as it is without you making things more muggy.  
**Yui:** This isn't muggy at all\! Actually, it's pretty cold after the rain...  
**Yui:** I just made a sound unbecoming of a maiden\! [her stomach growled]  
**Hiyori:** Who are you calling a maiden.  
**Yui:** No matter how you look at me, I'm a maiden, aren't I\!\? Anywayyy, my heart might be full, but my stomach right now...  
**Mai:** I did bring a bento box with me... Would you like to have some?  
**Yui:** I'd eat it even if it were poison\!  
**Kanami:** Then we should eat now, whil the rain's stopped\!  
**Kanami:** I'd hate to have the bento Mai-chan worked so hard to make get rained on.  
**Hiyori:** Hmm, it's simple, yet carefully made. Let's see... Mm, this is good.  
**Kofuki:** This karaage's seriously the best\! This onigiri too...  
**Mai:** Oh, that has...  
**Kofuki:** Natto\!\? Who puts natto in onigiri; that's just weird.  
**Kofuki:** ...Hey, but it's still good. There's plums, and sardine, and, what else did you mix in here?  
**Mai:** I used natto and plums as the base. After that, I would make some slight changes to add variety.  
**Hiyori:** I can tell you really challenged yourself with these onigiri, Mai. But, the sardines give it an interesting texture. It goes well together.  
**Yui:** Mmhmm, that's Mai-chan for you. I'm glad to be on this earth if it means I get to eat onigiri this good\~\~\~\!\!  
**Mai:** ...What do you think of them, Kanami-chan?  
**Kanami:** Of course I think they're extra delicious\! The ginger fried pork and kinpira are really good too, but I love the natto onigiri the most\!  
**Mai:** ...I'm glad to hear it.  
**Mai:** (I made that bento so you could eat it here, after all...)  
**Mai:** (It might not be the picnic we planned on, but I think this might be fine in its own way.)  
**Kanami:** Ah\~, that totally hit the spot\~. I wish I could eat your cooking every day, Mai-chan\!  
**Mai:** -\!\!  
**Kofuki:** Oh, nothing helps a full stomach like some exercise\! That's my aradama-chan, always looking out for me\!  
**Kofuki:** You're the last of 'em\! I love you\!  
**Hiyori:** So, that aradama had a teru teru bozu too?  
**Mai:** Wait? This is...  
**Kanami:** Did you notice something about the teru teru bozu?  
**Mai:** Could you let me see that, Hiyori-chan?  
**Hiyori:** Sure.  
**Mai:** Thank you.  
**Mai:** ...Mm, I'm sure of it. This is the teru teru bozu I made for today.  
**Hiyori:** Why would something you made end up here...?  
**Mai:** I thought it was in my room when I left, but... After that, maybe an aradama got it...?  
**Yui:** Hang on, there's a bigger mystery here than that\!  
**Mai:** Yui-chan?  
**Yui:** This smells... I can smell it...  
**Mai:** ...Smell what?  
**Yui:** The finely crafted bento, and the teru teru bozu hoping to stop the rain...  
**Hiyori:** The weather forecast did say the rainy season would end today.  
**Yui:** Exactly, which means, Mai-chan must have had plans to go on a date with someone today\!  
**Kanami:** Ohh-\! That's amazing, Yui-chan\! You almost figured it out\!  
**Hiyori:** (Wait, why did Kanami answer?)  
**Yui:** Was it with Sayaka-chan\!\? Were you going on a date with Sayaka-chan\!\?  
**Kofuki:** Get ahold of yourself. If she were going on a date with Sayaka, there would've been a bunch of cookies in the bento box, right?  
**Yui:** ...Ah-\! You're right\!\!  
**Mai:** Umm, I do have cookies here...  
**Yui:** I'll have some\!  
**Kanami:** Ah, can I have some too\!  
**Hiyori:** (Chew chew)... So anyway, who were you going on a date with?  
**Mai:** I was...  
**Mai:** (It's not something I need to keep a secret, but... For some reason, I don't want to say...)  
**Hiyori:** I guess this is no time for us to be standing around talking.  
**Kofuki:** Ah-\! A real big one showed up\! Time to help myself to dessert\!  
**Mai:** Let's go, everyone\!  
**Kanami:** Yeah\!  

## 3: The Scenery We Once Saw
**Aradama:** oouuu...  
**Hiyori:** Phew, we're just about done with them all.  
**Kofuki:** What, that's it already?  
**Yui:** I'm totally beat... Fighting in the rain is actually pretty tough...  
**Mai:** Do you want to take a short break then? If we wait a moment, the rain should clear up too.  
**Hiyori:** I don't see why not.  
**Kanami:** Mai-chan.  
**Mai:** What is it, Kanami-chan?  
**Kanami:** Will you come take a walk with me?  
**Mai:** (Kanami-chan... What could she want, asking that out of the blue?)  
**Kanami:** Mai-chan, do you remember?  
**Mai:** Eh?  
**Kanami:** We've been here before.  
**Mai:** ...You remembered that, Kanami-chan?  
**Kanami:** How could I forget\!  
**Kanami:** The time we stopped here, back when we had just become toji, on our way back from a mission. This place is important to us.  
**Mai:** Me too... I would never forget.  
**Mai:** To tell the truth, I was thinking of coming here for our picnic.  
**Kanami:** You were\!\?  
**Mai:** That's why, it was kind of depressing. This was the only place the rain didn't clear up... And then we were called on to suppress aradama.  
**Kanami:** Mai-chan...  
**Mai:** Even so... Getting to talk with you like this now... I'm a little glad.  
**Mai:** A lot happened, but... I think we got to make a more memories here than just a simple picnic, didn't we?  
**Kanami:** Of course we did\! I'll never forget about coming here today\!  
**Hiyori:** Kanami-\! Mai-\!  
**Kanami:** Hiyori-chan? What does she want?  
**Mai:** Let's go find out, Kanami-chan\!  
**Kanami:** What is it, Hiyori-chan?  
**Hiyori:** Look up at the sky\!  
**Kanami:** The sky...? Ah\!  
**Mai:** A rainbow...  
**Yui:** I never noticed this place was so beautiful.  
**Kofuki:** That's a weirdly decent comment from you. Did Mai's bento fix you?  
**Yui:** What if... It's purifying me from inside out\!\?  
**Hiyori:** ...I'm sure if we had eaten Mai's bento while looking out on this, it would have tasted even better.  
**Kanami/Mai:** ...Pfft. Ahaha\!  
**Hiyori:** What's with the two of you?  
**Kanami:** Oh, it's nothing\! I was thinking the same thing, Hiyori-chan\!  
**Mai:** In that case, how would you all feel about coming to a picnic here?  
**Mai:** I'd want Sayaka-chan and the others to see this scenery too.  
**Kanami:** That'd be great\!  
**Kofuki:** Bring the same onigiri with you again\! I wanna see the shock on their faces when they bite into it.  
**Yui:** And after their shock, they'll be hooked without a doubt\!  
**Yui:** Natto onigiri might become the next big thing, don't you think?  
**Hiyori:** If we're going to do it, we should do it soon. Now that the rainy season is over, summer is right around the corner.  
**Yui:** The season when girls start to shine is upon us\!  
**Kofuki:** You're always like this, aren't you.  
**Yui:** This is just my identity\!  
**Kanami:** When we get back, let's start planning it together with everyone\! It'll be a lot of fun, won't it, Mai-chan\!  
**Mai:** It sure will, Kanami-chan\!
