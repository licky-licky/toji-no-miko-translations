## 1: Traces of Yomi (1)
**Suzuka:** --We can see it now; the Tokyo Station building. Yomi-san, wherever you are, please be safe...  
**Yume:** Hey, doesn't the sky look really bad? The gate to the netherworld is getting a whole lot bigger.  
**Suzuka:** It is. We can't have much time left.  
**Maki:** Suzuka, Yume. Go back and leave this to me. I'll handle the rest here on my own.  
**Suzuka:** After all that's happened, you're still acting like that...?  
**Yume:** There's no way we're letting you do this on your own, Maki-onee-san...\!  
**Yume:** The elite guard are all going to get Yomi-onee-san together\!  
**Maki:** Kh... More aradama\!\?  
**Aradama:** SHAAAAAAAAAA\!  
**Yume:** Aghh, come on\! You're in our way\! We're in a hurry here, so go away\!  

## 2: Traces of Yomi (2)
**Maki:** ...Look over there, you two\! At the door to the building\!  
**Yume:** That's... What's left of Yomi-onee-san's aradama? There's so many of them...  
**Suzuka:** There should be no mistaking that this is where Yomi-san was going.  
**Maki:** From the looks of things, Yomi's relying far too hard on the power of noro.  
**Suzuka:** Considering that, Yomi-san must already be...  
**Yume:** We can still make it\! Because the elite guard is the four of us together\! We can't give up, no matter what\!  
**Suzuka:** Yume...  
**Maki:** ...That's right. Yume's right. Let's get to Yomi as fast as we can\!  

## 3: She's Alive\! (1)
At that time, with Etou Kanami and Origami Yukari, who had gone ahead to Tagitsuhime--

  
**Kanami:** Tagitsuhime\!  
**Tagitsu:** --Why have you come?  
**Kanami:** For you to give it back, Kogarasumaru--  
**Kanami:** ...Nn\!\? What's wrong, Chidori\!\?  
**Yukari:** ......\! ...So that's how it is. She's alive, Etou Kanami.  
**Yukari:** Juujou Hiyori is still alive\! Inside of her-- Inside Tagitsuhime\!  
**Yukari:** That resonance is the will and knowledge of Kogarasumaru\!  
**Kanami:** Hiyori-chan... she's... alive...?  
**Kanami:** She... is...  
**Kanami:** Then... We can't be crying now\! Not me, or Chidori\!  
**Kanami:** SEYAAAAAAAAAA\!\!  

## 4: She's Alive\! (2)
**Kanami:** Tagitsuhime\!\!  
**Yukari:** Kgh... My utsushi's gone\!\!  
**Tagitsu:** I apologize. It's difficult managing ones strength when handling flies.  
**Kanami:** UAAAAAAGGGGHHHHH\!\!  
**Kanami:** Gh... Not yet\!  
**Tagitsu:** --Hmph.  
**Kanami:** Grgh...\!  
**Tagitsu:** Heh. Is that all? Where is the technique you once tried to kill me with?  
**Kanami:** Pant... Pant...... SEIII\!\!  
**Tagitsu:** What's that?  
**Kanami:** Give back-- HIYORI-CHAN\!\!  
**Tagitsu:** ...What a fool.  

## 5: Yomi and Yukina (1)
**Aradama:** GUAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Yukina:** Get away from me-\! Get away get away get away-\! You damned aradama\! Just who do you think I am-\!\?  
**Aradama:** SHAAAAAAAA\!  
**Yukina:** KYAAAAA\!\! ...No... Stay back... Why... isn't anyone here...\!  
**Yukina:** After everything I did for you\! After all the love I gave you\! After all that, why\!\?  
**Yukina:** Princess\!\! Yukari-sama\!\! Why did you leave me-\!\?  
**Yukina:** Don't cast me aside\!\! Don't leave me on my own...\!\!  
**Aradama:** GRRRRAAAAA\!\!  
**Yukina:** ...? Wh-What was....?  
**Yukina:** Suijingiri Kanemitu...? ...Yo...mi?  
**Aradama:** SHAAAAAAA\!  
**Yomi:** ......Do not... Get in my way...\!  

## 6: Yomi and Yukina (2)
**Yukina:** Yomi...  
**Yomi:** When I--  
**Yomi:** When I passed the toji qualification exam, I left Akita. My family and everyone from my hometown were filled with pride.  
**Yomi:** I never lacked in effort. I arrived earlier than anyone to practice, and left after all others had gone. To be a toji as soon as I could, I spent my free time swinging a practice sword, alone.  
**Yomi:** Even so, I was not chosen by the okatana. I didn't have... The strength for it.  
**Yomi:** Still, I continued to practice with a sword. Believing that my dream would come true. But--  
**Yomi:** I saw the backs of my classmates as they passed me again and again. Again, and again, and again...  
**Yomi:** I was forced to accept the reality of my own powerlessness. However, I could not run back home.  
**Yomi:** The faces of everyone congratulating me were burned in my mind--  
**Yomi:** I couldn't stand the thought of disappointing them. It was frustrating. It was agonizing.  
**Yomi:** At that time, President Takatsu approached me.  
**Yukina:** If you want power, I can give it to you.  
**Yukina:** You have nothing to worry about. Your talents make you suitable to receive this power.  
**Yomi:** She said that I had talent. She gave me power. She was the only one, President Takatsu--  
**Yomi:** The only one who acknowledged me.  
**Yomi:** President Takatsu was the one who gave me hope. For President Takatsu, I would give anything.  
**Yomi:** Even my life--  
**Yukina:** ...Hmph, I was sure you had dropped dead by now, but you're stubborn if nothing else.  
**Yomi:** ......  
**Yukina:** You total failure of a guinea pig... Have you come to laugh at me now that I've lost everything?  
**Yomi:** ......Pres...ident...  
**Yukina:** HYAA\!\! Get away\!\! Don't come any closer\!\!  
**Yomi:** .........I have... now... returned... President Takatsu.  
**Yukina:** --\!\! ...Yomi... You...  
**Yukina:** You came back for me...\!\? Not the princess, or Yukari-sama, but for me...\!\!  
**Yomi:** ......  
**Aradama:** GUUAAAAA\!\!  
**Yukina:** ......\!  
**Yomi:** ...\!  
**Yukina:** Yomi, wait...\!  

## 7: Delaying (1)
**Mihono:** Pant... Pant... The number of aradama... Just keeps getting bigger and bigger...  
**Chie:** We should have expected it, since the gate to the netherworld is getting closer, but even this is more than I could have imagined...  
**Chie:** At this pace, we won't make it to Yukari-sama and the others...\!  
**Mirja:** --\! Imperial guard, straight ahead\! Brace yourselves\!  
**Chie:** Kh... Here to slow us down again...\!\?  
**Kiyoka:** Everyone\! I'll stay behind and draw the guards away\!  
**Kofuki:** Oi oi, are you gonna be able to manage that? I thought you were scared of fighting other toji?  
**Kiyoka:** I can't be like that in a situation like this\! We all have to work together if we want to make sure Hono-chan gets there in time\!  
**Kofuki:** Heheh, trying to make up for being a "waste of a toji"...? Look at you acting all cool\!  
**Kofuki:** Oi, Mirja, Chichie. I'm staying with her. Look after Mihocchi for me.  
**Mirja:** Musumi Kiyoka, Shichinosato Kofuki\! You are both approved to temporarily act on your own\!  
**Chie:** Take care of yourselves, you two\!  
**Imperial Guard A:** Stop-\! We won't let you go anywhere\!  
**Kofuki:** Shut the hell up\! We're the ones dealing with you\!  
**Kiyoka:** You aren't going to get in Hono-chan's way\!  
**Mihono:** Fukki\! Kiyoka\! Thanks\! I'll see you again soon\!  
**Kiyoka:** ...Kofuki-san. Thank you, for staying behind with me.  
**Kofuki:** Forget about it\! But as payback, that limited offer pudding you left in the fridge is mine\!  
**Kiyoka:** Ah... About that pudding, I forgot to write my name on it, so Hono-chan ate it...  
**Kofuki:** WHA---\!\? Again-\!\? Why does she think anything without a name on it is okay for her to eat\!\?  
**Kofuki:** ...Kiyoka, something important came up that I've gotta deal with. Let's wipe the floor with these guards already.  
**Kiyoka:** ...Alright\!  

## 8: Delaying (2)
**Kofuki:** ...You know, for all that big talk back there, you're still hesitating against other toji. Your timing's off when you're getting serious.  
**Kiyoka:** I-I'm sorry...  
**Kofuki:** Well, since we won, it's all good\! --C'mon, let's catch up to Ahocchi and them\! [aho means dumb]  
**Kiyoka:** Ah, you haven't forgotten about the pudding, have you. Fufu. You're cute when you get like that, Kofuki-san.  
**Kofuki:** Shut up\! Don't eat people's food if you don't want what's coming to you\! That's the way the world works\!  

## 9: Come Back to Me\!\! (1)
**Kanami:** Give Hiyori-chan back\! Give her back...\! Give her back...\!\!  
**Tagitsu:** Oh...?  
**Yukari:** Such incredible force of will...  
**Kanami:** Give her back... Give her back... Give her back... Give her back...\!\!  
**Yukari:** Is that the depth of her feelings for Juujou Hiyori...?  
**Kanami:** Hiyori-chan\!\! Come back to me\!\! UAAAAAA\!\!  
**Kanami:** I'm... Right here\!\! Hiyori-chan\!\!\!  

## 10: Come Back to Me\!\! (2)
**Kanami:** HYAAA\!\!  
**Tagitsu:** Grgh...\!  
**Kanami:** Hiyori-chan\!\!  
**Hiyori:** ...That voice... Kanami...? Ahh, honestly...  
**Hiyori:** No matter where I go...  
**Hiyori:** Kanami\!  
**Tagitsu:** Oh... Urgh... --GAHH\!\!  
**Hiyori:** HAAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Kanami:** --Hiyori-chan\!\?  
**Hiyori:** Your voice really carries.  
**Kanami:** Hiyori-chan...  
**Tagitsu:** So the little chicks have grown into a pair of lovebirds. Certainly an auspicious moment--  
**Tagitsu:** But it ends here\!  
**Yukari:** You won't have the chance\!\!  
**Kanami:** -\!\? UWAAAAAH\!\? The floor's... Falling apart\!\! We're gonna fall\!\!  
**Tagitsu:** Yukari...\!  

## 11: For You to be Here (1)
**Aradama:** GUAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Yomi:** ...\!  
**Yukina:** Yomi, wait...\!  
**Yomi:** President... Takatsu...  
**Maki:** There she is\!  
**Suzuka:** Yomi-san\!  
**Yume:** Yomi-onee-san\! Half her body, it's all... Turned into an aradama...\!\!  
**Suzuka:** How could you be so reckless...\!  
**Maki:** President... Takatsu...?  
**Yukina:** You three...  
**Maki:** That's why... That's what you were after, Yomi...\! Why you came here\!  
**Aradama:** GUAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Maki:** Every second counts\! Suzuka\! Yume\! Don't let Yomi exert herself\! We're going to finish this right here\!  
**Suzuka:** Right\!  
**Yume:** Got it\!  

## 12: For You to be Here (2)
**Maki:** Yomi...  
**Yomi:** All of... you... Why are... you here...?  
**Yume:** Isn't it obvious? We came here for you, Yomi-onee-san\!  
**Suzuka:** Yomi-san, you're the third seat of the elite gaurd...  
**Maki:** Our irreplaceable friend.  
**Yomi:** Your... friend...  
**Yume:** The four of us are one; that's the elite guard\! Right?  
**Suzuka:** That's right. After all, if one of us were to be missing, what would that make of us?  
**Yomi:** .........But, I...  
**Maki:** Come back with us, Yomi.  
**Yomi:** ............I will---  
**Other:** Angels of the Battlefield  
**Yui:** Nghh\~... It hurts all over; this might actually be pretty bad for me...\! I still have the stamina to keep going, but...\!  
**Yui:** If I could just stop the pain, I'm sure I could pull through somehow\!  
**Yui:** Ahh, I'm in serious trouble here... I think? I promised Mirja-san, I'd make it back alive no matter what. I don't want to make Mirja-san mad at me...  
**Yui:** Waiiit? But having that cool beauty glaring down at me and yelling, that's like a reward on its own\!  
**Yui:** Huh? But I have to make it back alive so she can yell at me... Ah... But if I make it back alive, she won't be mad...?  
**Yui:** Mm? What am I even saying anymore? Is the pain making me not make any sense?  
**Yui:** Ahh\~... Wowww, two angels are running over this way. You really do get to see stuff like this...  
**Toji A:** This is the rescue team, one toji has been secured\!  
**Toji B:** No issues with her vitals\! However, she seems to be somewhat delirious\!  
**Yui:** Huh...? Am I saved?
