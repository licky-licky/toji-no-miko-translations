## [SDDT - Maki: Start]: Maki of the Special Defense Team
**Maki:** Hmph\! ...Hmph\!  
**Yume:** Ah, I finally found you, Maki-onee-san\!  
**Maki:** ...Nn? What do you need, Yume?  
**Yume:** Is it true you're going on a trip alone together with Suzuka-onee-san? Why am I the only one who has to stay behind\! It's boring here\!  
**Maki:** Who told you something that misleading... We're not going on a trip; we're suppressing aradama.  
**Yume:** That sounds even funner\! You two get to do all the good stuff\!  
**Maki:** Don't act so spoiled, Yume. With us having only just been reorganized into the Special Defense Team, we're short on hands.  
**Maki:** We can't afford to neglect our duty to guard the Origami family and escort Akane-sama. Do you understand what I'm saying?  
**Yume:** ...Well, if I have to-.  
**Yume:** But you better buy me a souvenir\!\! Get me an Ichigo Daifuku Neko they sell there\!  
**Maki:** Got it. I'll buy you one, so long as I don't forget.  
**Maki:** ......  
**Suzuka:** Why the troubled face? How about you have a drink of tea and relax?  
**Maki:** I'll take it...  
**Suzuka:** You don't have to be so nervous. This will go fine. We only have to do it like we normally do.  
**Maki:** I'm not feeling nervous. It's just...  
**Suzuka:** Just?  
**Maki:** It's just a little hard to calm down.  
**Suzuka:** Doesn't that mean you're getting nervous?  
**Maki:** ...Maybe. I guess you're right.  
**Suzuka:** That's how you are, Maki-san.  
**Maki:** It's because we can't stop for anything until we atone for the past.  
**Suzuka:** You aren't entirely wrong to think that way, but... If you obsess over it, you'll only be making yourself suffer, alright?  
**Maki:** I know that, but, still.  
**Suzuka:** You're very serious, Maki-san.  
**Maki:** That's just how I am; I can't help it.  
**Maki:** By the way... Do you think they sell Ichigo Daifuku Nekos where the mission is taking place?  
**Suzuka:** Did Yume ask about it?  
**Maki:** Seems like she wants a souvenir.  
**Suzuka:** Of course she would. I'll look into it.  

## [SDDT - Maki: End]: Like a Hero
**Maki:** HAAAAAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Aradama:** oooo...  
**Maki:** There's more of them than I was expecting... Was it a mistake to split up from Suzuka...?  
**Maki:** It speeds up the rate we deal with them, but...\!  
**Aradama:** OOOOOOOOOOOOOO\!\!  
**Maki:** YAAAH\!\!  
**Maki:** Damn, I can't even get time to catch my breath.  
**Maki:** More of them are still coming...?  
**Maki:** The situation'll just keep getting worse as it is. I'll regroup with Suzuka so we can rethink our strategy.  
**Suzuka:** YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Aradama:** ...  
**Suzuka:** [pant, pant]... These numbers may be too much after all.  
**Suzuka:** I should regroup with Maki-san for now...  
**Aradama:** OOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\!\!  
**Suzuka:** Kh... For me to have let my guard down here...\!\!  
**Suzuka:** So I'm surrounded then...  
**Suzuka:** ...What a mess I've put myself in. Fatigue must have caused my concentration to slip...  
**Suzuka:** Though, don't assume I'll be beaten so easily\!  
**Maki:** SUZUKA--------\!\!  
**Suzuka:** Eh?  
**Maki:** Are you okay\!\?  
**Suzuka:** Maki-san...?  
**Maki:** Can you stand? Are you hurt?  
**Suzuka:** I'm just fine. Though...  
**Maki:** Though?  
**Suzuka:** For you to arrive with such perfect timing to rescue me... I'm a bit bewildered is all.  
**Maki:** ...You seem like you're fine enough to me.  
**Suzuka:** Of course I am. Just who do you think you're partnered with?  
**Maki:** The former second seat of the elite guard, Konohana Suzuka, if I recall.  
**Suzuka:** That's right. I won't have you looking down on me.  
**Maki:** ...Let's take them all out at once\!  
**Suzuka:** Understood, Maki-san\!  
**Suzuka:** You saved me, back there.  
**Maki:** I only did what needed to be done.  
**Maki:** Anyway, did you look into whether they sell any Ichigo Daifuku Neko goods here?  
**Suzuka:** Why yes, of course I looked it up.  
**Maki:** Oh, that's good.  
**Suzuka:** Fufu, allow me to lead the way.

## [Halloween 19 - Mirja: Start]: Kaiju Mirja?
**Yui:** Mirja-san, are you going to be debuting on the silver screen\!\?  
**Mirja:** Calm yourself, Yamashiro Yui. Do you remember before, when Itomi Sayaka appeared in that film?  
**Kofuki:** Oh yeah, that happened, didn't it. It was that time with the historical drama thing, right?  
**Yui:** If you mean that, I remember it too\! Sayaka-chan was extra cute back then, wasn't she\!  
**Mirja:** It seems the director from then has made another offer.  
**Yui:** So they've had their eyes on Mirja-san ever since then... They sure know their stuff.  
**Kofuki:** What's she talking about now.  
**Mirja:** No, that isn't entirely wrong... It seems that, somehow, they remember me from then, and made an offer.  
**Yui:** See\!  
**Kofuki:** What're you looking all smug for\!  
**Yui:** Anyway, I'm 100% going to go see it, Mirja-san\! I'll see it 7 million 7 hundred and 70 thousand times\!  
**Yui:** Actually, when are they filming it\! I want to go watch\!  
**Mirja:** On Halloween day.  
**Yui:** Halloween day\!\?  
**Yui:** That's when I was supposed to go with Kanami-chan and them to their Halloween event...  
**Yui:** Gununu... Do I go see Kanami-chan and Hiyori-chan in their costumes, or do I go see Mirja-san...  
**Mirja:** I should mention, along with myself, Itomi Sayaka and Iwakura Sanae will also be performing.  
**Yui:** Sayaka-chan and Sanae-san too\!\? B-Both of them are hard to pass up...  
**Kofuki:** You're making a pretty funny face now, y'know?  
**Yui:** How can I choose though\!  
**Mirja:** No matter how much you puzzle over it, I won't bring you with me. This is work.  
**Yui:** I understand...  
**Yui:** I'll wait with bated breath to see the precious sight of Mirja-san when the movie opens, and prioritize the event where I'll only have one chance to see Kanami-chan and everyone\!  
**Mirja:** That isn't what I meant... Though, if you can accept that, then it's fine.  
**Kofuki:** Well, if that's how it is, then you'd better get your body in shape for it.  
**Kofuki:** Here, eat these niboshi. Want some milk with that too?  
**Mirja:** ...Why niboshi and milk?  
**Kofuki:** If they're asking for you, it's cause they want you to play a kaiju, right? You've gotta be at least two meters for it then.  
**Mirja:** Of course I wouldn't receive an offer to play a kaiju. ...I will be playing a nun.  
**Kofuki:** A nun? That'll be a laugh.  
**Yui:** That's not true\! She'd look just perfect as one\!  
**Kofuki:** Well, either way, give it your best shot. I'll be looking forward to it.  
**Mirja:** ...Yes, I'll make every effort.  

## [Halloween 19 - Mirja: End]: Sister Mirja\!
On the day of filming.

  
**Sanae:** We finally have to perform... It's nervewracking. I-I think I should check over the script one more time...  
**Mirja:** Will you be alright, Iwakura Sanae?  
**Sanae:** Ah, Kitora-san... Since this is my first time doing something like this, I'm so nervous my hands won't stop shaking...  
**Mirja:** Nervousness brought on by apprehension?  
**Mirja:** Though, knowing you, you must have prepared extensively in advance, didn't you?  
**Sanae:** I did; I made sure to practice, and I memorized how to say all my lines right\!  
**Mirja:** In that case, there should be nothing for you to worry about. You'll do just fine.  
**Sanae:** Thank you, Kitora-san... But, if I don't double check, I'll be too nervous...  
**Sayaka:** ...The script.  
**Sanae:** Th-Thanks, Itomi-san\!  
**Staff:** We're starting-. Iwakura-san, Kitora-san, please be ready to go-.  
**Sanae:** Ah... L-Let's get going\!  
**Mirja:** Are you not going to check the script?  
**Sanae:** No, I'll be okay even if I don't.  
**Mirja:** (Her trembling has stopped. Is she the type who grows stronger when it comes time to act?)  
**Mirja:** Let's go, Iwakura Sanae.  
**Sanae:** Yes\!  
**Staff:** Alright now... Ready-, start\!  
**Mirja:** That sound... From upstairs...?  
**Mirja:** (...Suspcious of the sounds coming from the second floor, I go to investigate. When I climb the to top of the stairs, next comes...)  
**Mirja:** KYAAAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Sanae:** Ahahahaha\! For you to be so shocked, my mischief was a big sucess nya\!  
**Mirja:** J-Just what are you\!  
**Sanae:** What am I? Just a plain old cat, nya.  
**Mirja:** You demon cat... I-I'll destroy you here\!  
**Sanae:** You can go ahead and try, nya\!  
**Mirja:** (Iwakura Sanae comes rushing in... I fight back with the candlestick I'm holding.)  
**Sanae:** Unyaa\!\?  
**Mirja:** It's afraid of the flames...? Then\!  
**Mirja:** (Throwing the candlestick, while she's frightened by the flames, I take the knife I had hidden...\!)  
**Sanae:** UNYAAAAAAAAAA\!\! I'LL REMEMBER THIS, NYAAAAA\!\!  
**Mirja:** ... It ran away? ...What is happening in this mansion...?  
**Staff:** Okaaay, that's good.  
**Mirja:** Phew, nicely done, Iwakura Sanae. Thanks to your performance, we were able to make a fine action scene.  
**Sanae:** Not at all\! It's because of you, Mirja-san, that I think I was able to act so well\!  
**Mirja:** Then, why don't we say it's because of the both of us?  
**Sanae:** Alright\! Ahh... Now that that's over, I'm feeling kind of hungry.  
**Mirja:** In that case, once Itomi Sayaka's scene is finished, how about we go to eat together?  
**Sanae:** Sure thing\! There's a delicious mizusawa udon place close by\!  
**Mirja:** Mizusawa udon is the udon of Gunma, isn't it? This isn't Gunma, though?  
**Sanae:** I looked it up beforehand, thinking it could come in handy\!  
**Mirja:** I-I see...  
**Mirja:** (What exactly was she expecting to need it for... Though, Iwakura Sanae seems to be happy about it... Well, there's no harm in it.)  
**Mirja:** Then, I'll be looking forward to it.  
**Sanae:** Sure\! Please do\!

## [Aradama Hoodie - Kofuki: Start]: Pissing Me Off
**Kofuki:** GYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Mihono:** \!\? Just now, that was...  
**Tsugumi:** Yes, that was the shrill scream of Shichinosato-san just now.  
**Mihono:** Knowing Fukki, an aradama probably didn't get the drop on her or something, right?  
**Tsugumi:** Yes, it's difficult to imagine. I think it's safe to say something else must have occurred.  
**Mihono:** Something that would make Fukki scream like that...?  
**Tsugumi:** That's right. ...That aside, "gyaaaaaaa" is just the sort of scream you'd expect from Shichinosato-san, isn't it.  
**Mihono:** Ahaha, you're not wrong. Anyway, let's go see what happened\!  
**Mihono:** Fukki\!  
**Kofuki:** You two're slow. Though, thanks to that, I got to take my sweet time having fun with the aradma-chan.  
**Tsugumi:** This is exactly as predicted so far. So then, what was that scream earlier about?  
**Kofuki:** What, you heard that?  
**Mihono:** When you scream that loud, of course we'd hear it.  
**Kofuki:** Whoops, sorry. I couldn't help myself from shouting. Aghh, just thinking about it pisses me off.  
**Mihono:** Pisses you off? The aradama?  
**Kofuki:** You dumbass, Mihocchi\! There's no way an aradama-chan'd piss me off\!  
**Kofuki:** What pissed me off was that tree there\!  
**Tsugumi:** ...You love aradama, and you hate vegetation. You're very irritable.  
**Tsugumi:** Shichinosato-san, I'm slightly concerned for your future.  
**Kofuki:** I don't get what you're getting at, but I can tell you're making fun of me.  
**Tsugumi:** You seem to be lacking calcium. Would you like a candy?  
**Kofuki:** I've got milk to drink\! And like I'd eat that shady looking candy anyway\!  
**Mihono:** Ahaha\! You two sure get along-. So, what happened anyway, Fukki?  
**Kofuki:** This here\!  
**Mihono:** Your jacket?  
**Tsugumi:** Oh? It's slightly torn.  
**Mihono:** Ah, it is\!  
**Kofuki:** It got caught on that branch.  
**Tsugumi:** I see, so that's why. Though, it's hardly a problem, is it? You have lots of similar jackets you can go back and get.  
**Kofuki:** Doesn't matter; what pisses me off pisses me off\!  
**Mihono:** Then, how about next day we have off, we go clothes shopping together?  
**Kofuki:** Clothes shopping? I haven't been in a while, so that sounds good.  
**Mihono:** Nice\! You should come too, Tsugumi-san\! It's a date\!  

## [Aradama Hoodie - Kofuki: End]: On To the Shopping\!
**Mihono:** And with that, we're here, Harajuku\!  
**Kofuki:** Yawwn... I'm tired.  
**Tsugumi:** That's because you were asleep on the train. Here, have some of this and you'll be wide awake.  
**Kofuki:** Oh-... Thanks...  
**Mihono:** Ah.  
**Kofuki:** BFWOO-\!\?  
**Kofuki:** Oi, what'd you feed me\!\!  
**Tsugumi:** Just something simple to eliminate drowsiness.  
**Kofuki:** Don't pass me toxic crap like it's no big deal\! You're freaky.  
**Tsugumi:** Am I?  
**Mihono:** Fukki's looking wide awake now at least, so let's go buy some clothes\!  
**Mihono:** By the way, how do you pick out your clothes, Fukki?  
**Mihono:** I remember Kiyoka saying, "Fukki's got a great sense of style\!\", so I've been curious ever since.  
**Kofuki:** I just pick out whatever. Cruise around the shops and buy stuff...  
**Kofuki:** See, like that? Ohm.  
**Mihono:** You say, "like that", but... Where'd you find these hoodies?  
**Kofuki:** They were in the middle of the store, remember? [chew chew]  
**Mihono:** I didn't see it... Nnn, this kind of thing's pretty cute too.  
**Kofuki:** It looks good on you, Mihocchi. This's good.  
**Mihono:** Thanks, Fukki.  
**Tsugumi:** It's somewhat embarrassing the way we all match though, isn't it?  
**Kofuki:** You think so? [chew chew] Mm-\!  
**Mihono:** ...That crepe must be yummy, huh.  
**Kofuki:** ...[grin] Mihocchi, you want a bite?  
**Mihono:** Can I?  
**Kofuki:** Sure, but you get one bite, alright? Here... Open wide.  
**Mihono:** Ahh-... Nngh\!\?  
**Mihono:** Hey, Fukki\! Weren't you gonna let me have some\!\?  
**Kofuki:** Ahahahahaha\! If you wanted to eat some, then go buy it yourself, Mihocchi.  
**Tsugumi:** Ohm. ...[chew chew] I see, it is fairly good.  
**Kofuki:** Hey, don't you go eating it\!  
**Mihono:** Now's my chance... Mmm-, so good\!  
**Kofuki:** Mihocchi too\!\? Ahh, damnit\! Gimme back the bits you ate\!  
**Mihono:** How am I supposed to do that when I ate it\!  
**Tsugumi:** You could just go buy another one, Shichinosato-san.  
**Kofuki:** Like you can talk when you're the one who went and ate it-\!

## [Stage Girl - Kanami: Start]: Somebody I Want to Spar With\!
**Maya:** Now then, I'll have you leave the stage. --HAAH\!  
**Karen:** YAH\!  
**Karen:** Nice\! I beat it-.  
**Aradama:** GUGGGIIIII\!  
**Hikari:** You won't get away-- This will finish it\!  
**Kanami:** These stage girls, they're all so amazing, aren't they\! They fight differently from a toji, but I'm enjoying myself just watching them go\!  
**Yui:** Ahh... You can't help but be captivated by them, can you\~.  
**Yui:** Would you call it their posturing? Every one of the motions they go through grabs hold tight of my heart... It's so good\!  
**Kanami:** Yeah, I know just what you mean\! Ahh, even if only for a little bit, I want to spar with all the stage girls\!  
**Karen:** Kanami-chan, Kanami-chan, what's "spar" mean?  
**Kanami:** Ah, sparring is when you face off... It's a practice match\!  
**Karen:** A practice match, huh\~. I think I might wanna have one too\!  
**Futaba:** It'd be useful reference material for sword fights on stage, wouldn't it.  
**Kaoruko:** Sure would. Though, I'm not about to join you.  
**Kanami:** Sure\! You only have to join in if you want to\! I don't think it's good to force training in.  
Hikari Slipping through my firmly raised hands, the vow we made that day fell into the abyss. I once again climb towards my stage of destiny. Even if it must end in tragedy... 99th generation, Kagura Hikari. It is all for the sake of Starlight\!

  
**Kanami:** Wow-, being able to recite a line like that so smoothly; people training to be pros sure are something else.  
**Hikari:** I am a stage girl, so this much is natural.  
**Kanami:** Even still, it's pretty amazing.  
**Kanami:** Oh yeah, thanks, Hikari-chan.  
**Hikari:** What? Why are you thanking me suddenly?  
**Kanami:** For sparring with me. I'm really happy you agreed\!  
**Hikari:** I just thought this experience might be useful on the stage. Are you ready?  
**Kanami:** I'm ready to go anytime\!  
**Hikari:** Then... --YAH\!  
**Kanami:** That was a nice thrust, Hikari-chan\! Now I'll go\! HAAH\!  
**Hikari:** ...Kh\! Then, I'll--\!  
**Hikari:** ...You're watching my movements closely.  
**Kanami:** That's good\! Show me more and more, Hikari-chan, of the way that you fight\!  

## [Stage Girl - Kanami: End]: It Is All for the Sake of Starlight\!
**Hikari:** ...There-\!  
**Kanami:** \!\? That was a little risky just now\!  
**Kanami:** You're using the spring in your body to get even sharper with your strikes\! That was a great thrust\!  
**Hikari:** ...You were able to dodge that just now? Toji really do have great physical performance.  
**Kanami:** It's important to be able to avoid taking hits in battle, after all. That's a part of training too.  
**Hikari:** Then, what will you do if I do this?  
**Kanami:** Eh\!\? You threw your weapon\!\?  
**Hikari:** Thank you. You deflected it just how I wanted you to.  
**Kanami:** Wawah\!\? ...She's flying with a wire\!\?  
**Hikari:** And now--\!\!  
**Kanami:** Seeing that attack just now you did with the wire sent a chill up my spine-. You were right up in front of me all of a sudden.  
**Kanami:** So you can fight like that too, huh\!  
**Hikari:** ...You blocked it so easily though.  
**Kanami:** I mean, if I didn't block that right, I'd be done for. It wasn't easy for me at all.  
**Hikari:** There's something I want to ask you... Why did you decide to have a match with me?  
**Kanami:** Because I saw you not even flinching as you were fighting aradama, I guess.  
**Hikari:** That should be the same for the other stage girls too. We all want the auditions to resume soon.  
**Kanami:** You're right, but you were still a little different after all. I think it would be scary to fight with that short sword-like dagger, Hikari-chan.  
**Kanami:** But still, you have a strong determination to fight. That's the feeling I got. So that's why I wanted to spar with you.  
**Hikari:** ......  
**Kanami:** And once we got down to it, it was super exciting\!  
**Kanami:** Ah\! I wish I could try moving around with wires like you did, Hikari-chan-.  
**Hikari:** You can't; I won't give it to you.  
**Kanami:** I can't-? That's a bit of a shame\!  
**Kanami:** Hey. Hikari-chan, what did you think of sparring with me?  
**Hikari:** Hm, real swordfighting was incredible. Teach me. Even if it's only the basic movements.  
**Kanami:** Sure thing\! I'll welcome anybody interested in swordfighting with open arms\! We'll start with your stance, okay?  
**Hikari:** This kind of seems like it could take a while... But, I'll be in your care.
