## 1: Everyone's... Pretty Motivated, Aren't They?
**Yomi:** From here, you will be organized into units formed by two or three groups from the earlier practice... and undertake this mission in Harajuku.  
**Yomi:** These may be hasty arrangements, but... I ask you all for your support.  
**Hiyori:** ...The silver lining is this happened while we were here training. With all these people, we can take care of it quick.  
**Sayaka:** Mm... I want to show what we've learned from training.  
**Suu:** Ahhh... Even though the training was hard, I thought we wouldn't be in any danger at least...  
**Suu:** Ah--\!?  
**Suu:** With all these amazing people here, do they really need me? They don't need me, do they\!  
**Hokuto:** That won't do. This is your mission too, so you need to handle it properly.  
**Suu:** But I think I'm definitely not needed here... Sigh... It's scary; I don't want to fight any aradama.  
**Kiyoka:** I understand the way you're feeling. Me too... I don't want to have to fight if I can help it.  
**Suu:** ...Musumi-san\!  
**Suu:** (They give me support and they help me out; maybe I can depend on people from Heijou...?)  
**Suu:** I'll keep being in your care then\!  
**Kiyoka:** Nn? ...Mmhm, likewise.  
**Tsugumi:** Shichinosato-san, I'm relying on you to get me aradama data.  
**Kofuki:** Yeah, count on it.  
**Suu:** (Ah... Thinking about this the other way around, with all these strong people here, doesn't that make this a really safe mission?)  
**Suu:** Shichinosato-san's started looking all excited too.  
**Kiyoka:** That's usually how she is before we go on a mission.  
**Kofuki:** You better be letting me play with some aradama-chan tough enough to be worth it, okay?  
**Maki:** No need to worry about that. We're expecting a lot from the group with you, Itomi, and Juujou.  
**Maki:** The site you're going to has a high number of outbreaks.  
**Sayaka:** Understood.  
**Suu:** Ahhhhh... Why do you want to go to the most dangerous places?  
**Suu:** (I just don't get it... Are Shichinosato-san and Itomi-san actually space aliens or something...?)  
**Hokuto:** Don't make that face. If it comes down to it, I'll be there to save you.  
**Suu:** Hokuto-san... I won't leave your side\!\!  
**Hokuto:** Then we wouldn't be able to fight, would we...?  
**Suu:** ...Are you feeling that motivated for this?  
**Hokuto:** I am. It's rare to join a mission alongside a select group of top fighters. There's nothing to dislike about it.  
**Kiyoka:** I am feeling a little nervous, but let's try our best to keep up, Asahina-san, Inami-san.  
**Hokuto:** Of course. It looks like we're about to start. Let's go.  
**Suu:** Ahhh\~...  

## 2: That's Why I Said I Didn't Want to Do This...
**Hokuto:** YAAH\!  
**Hokuto:** Leave the smaller sized aradama to us. Could you handle that big aradama\!  
**Tsugumi:** Don't worry about any coming up behind you, Itomi-san, Juujou-san.  
**Hiyori:** Got it. Let's go, Sayaka.  
**Sayaka:** Mm... We'll finish this quickly.  
**Kofuki:** What's wrong, what's wrong\!  
**Aradama:** GUOOOOOO...\!\!  
**Kofuki:** Oh\! Looks like you wanna keep going; so I'll play with you\!  
**Kiyoka:** It feels like more and more aradama keep coming here...  
**Kiyoka:** Kofuki-san, if it's possible, let's try sticking close together to fight\!  
**Kiyoka:** Ah, she ran off. Please come baaaack\!  
**Kofuki:** Just gimme a minute.  
**Aradama:** ...GUGGGI\!  
**Suu:** ...Waaahh\!? They came this way\!?  
**Suu:** I feel like I'm in danger; I'm running away\!  
**Kiyoka:** Not you too, Inami-san\!? There's still aradama that way\!  
**Aradama:** ......  
**Kofuki:** This's it for you--  
**Suu:** Save me... pleaseeeeee...\!  
**Kofuki:** Huh\!? Hey... You're getting in the way of the good part\!  
**Suu:** Buttt...  
**Kofuki:** Well, I'll give you credit for bringing me more aradama-chan at least\!  
**Aradama:** ...GGGII\!  
**Suu:** Eeeeeek\!?  
**Kiyoka:** ...Inami-san\!? Whatever you do, keep your utsushi up\!  
Elsewhere, Hokuto and the others were--

  
**Hiyori:** Things are taken care of over here.  
**Hiyori:** It was a real help having you handle the aradama following the big one around, Asahina-san, Ban-san.  
**Sayaka:** Mm... We could focus on it thanks to you and Tsugumi.  
**Tsugumi:** No need to thank us. It's our mission.  
**Hokuto:** I only did what I was capable of.  
**Hokuto:** (Itomi Sayaka, Juujou Hiyori... They really are strong.)  
**Hokuto:** (It's not that I think I'll get the chance to become that strong just by completing missions with them, but, a toji's strength... There might be no limit to it.)  
**Hokuto:** (Though... Why are there this many talented individuals in one group to begin with?)  
**Screaming Voice:** EEEEEEKK\!?  
**Screaming Voice:** SOMEBODY HELP MEEEEEEEEEE...\!  
**Hiyori:** Just now; that's...\!  
**Hokuto:** ...It's Suu. Let's hurry.  
**Suu:** Musumi-san... Shichinosato-san\! I'm begging you... I'm begging you, so... Hurry\!  
**Kofuki:** There's still way more aradama-chan to go through, so sit put\!  
**Kiyoka:** Inami-san, you reapplied utsushi just now, didn't you? That makes the third time... There aren't a lot of toji who can reuse utsushi that much.  
**Sayaka:** We came to save you, but, you seem okay...?  
**Suu:** I'm not okay at all... At all\!  
**Sayaka:** I saw you reapply utsushi just now. You can still fight.  
**Suu:** I've been in a huge pinch this whole time\!  
**Hokuto:** She can still fight. Suu can use utsushi even more than this.  
**Suu:** Why are you telling them that\!?  
**Sayaka:** That's amazing...  
**Kofuki:** In that case, you can keep on being aradama bait for me\!  
**Suu:** Ehhhhh\!?  
**Aradama:** ......  
**Tsugumi:** Certain data does indicate that aradama also tend to attack weaker seeming targets. Though it's still in need of verification.  
**Suu:** Don't just decide that on your own...\!\! I'm not an aradama charmer, okay\!?  
**Sayaka:** You don't need to worry. We'll protect you, Suu.  
**Suu:** Th-Thank you very much\!  
**Suu:** But still, I want you to save me right now\! Get me out of this situation...\!  

## 3: If Possible... I'd Like a Break From Missions for a While 
**Suu:** Eep\!?  
**Tsugumi:** Are you doing alright-?  
**Suu:** I just got a little spooked by the sound of okatana hitting an aradama...  
**Suu:** Even though I realize everyone's getting rid of the aradama.  
**Tsugumi:** I see. Though, Inami-san, it seems like you can use utsushi a great number of times, so if you were able to overcome your fears facing aradama, it would be very unlikely you would get hurt.  
**Suu:** Thinking about it is one thing, but actually doing it is a whole different story.  
**Tsugumi:** I understand. Raw data gathered from aradama will be biased, so it's vital to see the aradama moving about up close like this as well.  
**Tsugumi:** Today is looking to be an auspicious day, with all the aradama I've gotten to see and the data to collect.  
**Suu:** Ah.  
**Suu:** (This person too... She's dangerous after all\!)  
**Suu:** (I don't know how many times I've thought this now, but... Let this be over already-\!)  
**Kiyoka:** I'm leading this aradama over towards you\!  
**Kofuki:** Sure\! Don't worry about beating 'em, just keep sending more and more aradama-chan my way\!  
**Kiyoka:** We're only doing it like this for today, okay?  
**Kofuki:** I'm more than happy to do this anytime though.  
**Hokuto:** Shichinosato-san\! Would it be alright for me to send one more aradama at you then?  
**Kofuki:** I'll take any of them you've got\!  
**Kofuki:** Step right up, fresh aradama-chan\!  
**Hokuto:** (We weren't at all able to reach the coordination we were working towards during practice, in the end.)  
**Hokuto:** (With Shichinosato-san, we could hardly even take a formation.)  
**Kiyoka:** Honestly... You're only paying attention to the aradama that come right in front of you.  
**Hokuto:** (But outside of practice, Shichinosato-san is like a different person.)  
**Hokuto:** (And Musumi-san, understanding her nature, smoothly supports her while fighting the aradama.)  
**Hokuto:** I can't let myself lose here either... can I.  
**Sanae:** Great work, everyone-. Today was a little rough on us, huh.  
**Hiyori:** Were you in charge of leading a different group, Iwakura-san?  
**Sanae:** Mmhm. I was working together with the people from my group to stop the aradama from leaving the predicted area, and also helping escort anyone who couldn't evacuate on time.  
**Sayaka:** I wouldn't really be able to do that.  
**Sanae:** Everyone has their own role. I wouldn't be able to fight like you can either, Itomi-san.  
**Hiyori:** Sayaka. Since there were so many aradama, you must have taken out a lot of them, right?  
**Sayaka:** I stopped remembering how many halfway.  
**Hokuto:** If we're comparing numbers, you would have gotten the most, wouldn't you?  
**Kofuki:** Probably-. I got to play with so many aradama-chan I couldn't even keep up counting, so I'm satisfied.  
**Kofuki:** I've got her to thank for that too.  
**Hokuto:** Suu wouldn't feel so fortunate though... You really do love to fight aradama, don't you.  
**Hokuto:** I can't overlook that you ignored both orders and the unit's formation, but adaptability is a necessity, and I admire your dedication to the mission.  
**Hokuto:** I suppose it's fine so long as you don't cause any trouble for the girls you're assigned to work with.  
**Kofuki:** Heh, Kiyoka can handle it so it's all good.  
**Suu:** I don't know how many times I thought I was going to die today... I mean it, I'm on my last legs.  
**Hokuto:** Though, since you weren't hurt in the end, it turned out fine.  
**Suu:** No way; this time was bad enough that I want a special vacation or something. My heart took more than enough damage\!  
**Maki:** What's this? I'd heard Inami was about to drop from exhaustion, but you look lively enough to me.  
**Suu:** Shidou-san\!? D-Did you need something from us?  
**Maki:** Nothing in particular. Just checking in on the toji who took part in the mission.  
**Hokuto:** You elite guard must have had your hands full too. Though, there's something on my mind. Mind if I ask you?  
**Maki:** Go right ahead.  
**Hokuto:** Whichever way you look at it, don't you think the group Suu and I were put in had an excessive amount of fighting strength?  
**Maki:** Ahh, that's what you mean. The plan was always to make one team of more average ability and one with more capable fighters.  
**Maki:** Just in order to counter any powerful aradama that appeared. On top of that, there were a lot of unique individuals, so it was Suzuka's thinking that having them all in one place would make them easier to manage.  
**Hokuto:** ...Because of that, we had a lot of trouble.  
**Suu:** And I... I ended up being some kind of aradama bait... It was the worst.  
**Maki:** ...That must have been difficult. Though, while the average level of students chosen for this training was high, not many could keep up with that group you were in.  
**Maki:** Knowing you two, I suggested you. And, it doesn't look like I was wrong.  
**Suu:** Sigh... Just because I can use utsushi a little more than usual, I wish you wouldn't forget how weak I am...  
**Sayaka:** I... I want to see how many times you can apply utsushi.  
**Suu:** I-Itomi-sama\!? How long have you been here for\!?  
**Sayaka:** Not long. I saw you from the front entrance.  
**Sayaka:** But, why are you using "sama"? I'm... not that important.  
**Suu:** Itomi-sama... You're way too strong, aren't you... So that's why\!  
**Sayaka:** There are toji stronger than me. ...You can call me Sayaka.  
**Suu:** No no no... There's no way I could say your name that bluntly\! At least let me use Sayaka-san\!\!  
**Sayaka:** Alright. And... How many more times can you apply utsushi, Suu? I want to see.  
**Suu:** How many more times...? I'm all out of stock for today, so I can't show you any more utsushis\!  
**Sayaka:** That's a shame...  
**Sayaka:** But, we go to the same school. I'll look forward to when we go on missions together.  
**Suu:** It's not like it's any fun to see either...  
**Hokuto:** ......  
**Suu:** Hokuto-san, why do you look like you're enjoying this. You're a bully.  
**Hokuto:** That's not what I was smiling about. I was just thinking, it might have been difficult, but this was a good experience for you.  
**Hokuto:** If nothing comes up, I won't be leaving for another two days, so do you want to go out somewhere and enjoy ourselves tomorrow?  
**Suu:** Absolutely\! I'll start coming up with a list of places to go right now\!  
**Hokuto:** You really do change moods at the drop of a hat, don't you.
