## [Xmas' 20 - Kagari: Start]: Let's Not
**Minato:** Let's throw a Christmas party\!  
**Kagari:** Let's not.  
**Minato:** Ehh, come on, Kagari-.  
**Minato:** It's Christmas and everything, so aren't we missing out not having fun with it?  
**Kagari:** ...Sigh.  
**Kagari:** Unlike you, Minato-senpai, Yukari-sama is still busy on Christmas.  
**Kagari:** She doesn't have the time to be having a party.  
**Minato:** C'mon, don't be like that-.  
**Minato:** Yukari's gonna suffocate if she doesn't have some fun. Right, Yukari?  
**Yukari:** Don't you think it's unfair pushing this on me?  
**Minato:** Is it?  
**Yukari:** Honestly...  
**Yukari:** Kagari, if we work with my schedule, couldn't we fit an hour in?  
**Kagari:** Yukari-sama\!\?  
**Minato:** Awesome\!  
**Minato:** Alright, I'll go invite everybody then\! Thanks, Yukari\!  
**Kagari:** These are the only times she works quickly... Will this really be alright?  
**Yukari:** Sure. So, you need to enjoy the Christmas party too, Kagari.  
**Kagari:** No, I'll just...  
**Yukari:** If you say that you aren't going, Minato would come by almost every day.  
**Kagari:** Urgh...  
**Yukari:** Just give up on it.  
**Kagari:** ...Sigh.  
**Minato:** That makes Yukari, Kagari, Yuzuki-senpai, Iroha-senpai, Ema, Yukina, Sana, and Akane-chan... This'll be a fun Christmas party\!  
**Minato:** It's cold though\!  
**Minato:** It's been getting colder lately... Wonder if it'll snow on Christmas?  

## [Xmas' 20 - Kagari: End]: A White Christmas
On Christmas.

  
**Minato:** HAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Aradama:** ooo...  
**Minato:** Come on, why's it we always get missions on days like today\!  
**Kagari:** Please work your hands more than your mouth, Minato-senpai.  
**Kagari:** HAAH\!  
**Aradama:** ...  
**Minato:** I'm doing that just fine.  
**Minato:** And besides, you looked like you were getting into setting things up for the party. Aren't you bummed out?  
**Kagari:** Since I said I would do it, I wanted to do it properly.  
**Kagari:** That aside, Minato-senpai. If you want to go to the Christmas party so badly, please take this mission seriously.  
**Kagari:** The time you're wasting here is going to take away from that.  
**Minato:** You've got a point\! Let's hurry it up, Kagari\!  
**Kagari:** Does anything ever get you down... Ah.  
**Kagari:** Snow?  
**Kagari:** No wonder it feels so cold...  
**Minato:** What's wrong... Hey, it's snowing\!  
**Minato:** It's a white Christmas, Kagari\!  
**Kagari:** ...It is.  
**Minato:** Now I'm feeling it\! Let's go, Kagari\!  
**Kagari:** Alright\!  
**Kagari:** We never managed to hold the Christmas party in the end. It only snowed for that brief moment too...  
**Minato:** Hey, there's nothing we could do about it.  
**Kagari:** ...You don't seem that disappointed?  
**Minato:** Yeah, I guess not?  
**Minato:** Somehow, just getting to see the snow with you's got me satisfied\!  
**Kagari:** ...  
**Kagari:** What's that supposed to mean?  
**Minato:** Well, it's all good. Anyway, let's make sure to throw a Christmas party next year, Kagari.  
**Kagari:** I'd rather not be keeping you company again next year, Minato-senpai.

## [Xmas' 20 - Maki: Start]: Looking for a Christmas Cake
**Maki:** ...  
**Maki:** ............  
**Yume:** Maki-onee-san, how long're you planning on doing this for-?  
**Maki:** Just give me a little longer, Yume.  
**Maki:** This cake has to be a Christmas cake, but at the same time it also has to be Yomi's birthday cake.  
**Maki:** Finding a cake that Yomi'll like... It's tough.  
**Yume:** Oh, okay.  
**Maki:** Thinking about what Yomi likes, there's omusubi, but...  
**Yume:** Then, can't we just go with a rice cake?  
**Maki:** A rice cake... That's true; with a name like that, Yomi'd probably like it.  
**Maki:** Okay, let's buy one\!  
**Maki:** This isn't good, Suzuka\!  
**Suzuka:** What's the matter?  
**Maki:** Rice cakes aren't actually cakes\!  
**Suzuka:** That's right, they aren't?  
**Maki:** ...You knew about that?  
**Suzuka:** Yes. If you look up the word rice cake, you'll find mochi...  
**Suzuka:** That isn't what you ordered, is it, Maki-san?  
**Maki:** Yeah. What I got was something like puffed up rice in a disc shape.  
**Suzuka:** That sounds about right.  
**Suzuka:** Honestly, why would you order something like that?  
**Maki:** I thought it'd make Yomi happy, as a Christmas cake...  
**Suzuka:** What am I going to do with you.  
**Suzuka:** Rice cakes are something you can eat like crackers.  
**Suzuka:** All we can do now is prepare a different cake for Yomi-san's birthday.  
**Suzuka:** Fortunately, we still have time to spare.  
**Maki:** Oh yeah... You're right.  
**Maki:** I'll look for another cake Yomi'll be happy with.  

## [Xmas' 20 - Maki: Start]: With a Special Someone
**Maki:** Still though, a different cake... What can I get?  
**Ellen:** Makimaki\! You look like something's bothering you; what're you up to?  
**Maki:** Kohagura? Actually...  
**Ellen:** I see, so you're worried over what to get for Yomiyomi's birthday cake.  
**Ellen:** In that case, there's a shop I can recommend to you\!  
**Maki:** Really\!\?  
**Ellen:** Yes\! It's been my favorite lately\!  
**Maki:** That sounds reliable.  
**Ellen:** Though, I'll give you a bit of advice. I'm sure that, whatever cake you get for her, Yomiyomi will be happy.  
**Maki:** ...Could you tell me why you think that?  
**Ellen:** Anyone would be happy with whatever someone tried so hard to pick out for them.  
**Maki:** ...  
**Maki:** You're right; maybe I've been overthinking this a little. I'll pay that cake shop a visit.  
**Ellen:** I hope it'll make your Christmas Day wonderful\!  
On Christmas Eve.

  
**Maki:** HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Aradama:** ...  
**Watanuki Kazumi:** Maki-sama\!  
**Kazumi:** There's no more readings on the spectrum finder. That aradama seems to have been the last of them.  
**Maki:** Alright... Good work, everybody.  
**Tojis:** Right\!  
**Maki:** It's Christmas Eve. Some of you must have plans.  
**Maki:** You should spend the rest of the night with the people special to you.  
**Tojis:** Okay\!\!  
**Kazumi:** Err, Maki-sama, do you have any plans for later...? If you wouldn't mind...  
**Maki:** I have to be at a Christmas and birthday party for Yomi.  
**Kazumi:** ...I see then.  
**Kazumi:** I hope you'll enjoy yourself\!  
**Maki:** Thanks, Kazumi. I hope you'll have a good Christmas Eve too.  
**Kazumi:** ...Right\!

## [Xmas' 20 - Mihono: Start]: The Investigation Team's Christmas Party (Preparations)
**Mihono:** Jingle bells\~, jingle bells\~.  
**Mirja:** Stop singing and put your hands to work. We won't finish getting ready for the Christmas party at this rate.  
**Mihono:** Okaaay\!  
**Chie:** Hey, Mirja. About the cooking for the party...  
**Mirja:** That's right... I'll leave everything to you, Setouchi Chie. You're our best when it comes to cooking.  
**Chie:** Alright then.  
**Chie:** Everyone, can I have a moment? For the cooking for the party, does anyone have any requests?  
**Tsugumi:** Cooking, hm. Should I help with that?  
**Kofuki:** Hell no\! Are you trying to ruin everybody's Christmas\!\?  
**Tsugumi:** That's a shame.  
**Kofuki:** Anyway, what about that? That chicken\! That tasted so good.  
**Kiyoka:** That chicken... I'm pretty sure Hono-chan bought it, right?  
**Mihono:** Yeah\! It was from this meat shop I stumbled across.  
**Mihono:** It smelled so good walking past the store, so I tried some croquettes, and they were really yummy\! So I decided to get chicken from there.  
**Mihono:** Their croquettes, meatcakes, ham cutlets... They all tasted good.  
**Mihono:** The meatcakes were so juicy, and the ham cutlets were really thick\!  
**Kofuki:** [gulp] Just hearing you talk about them's making me hungry... Wait, hold up. I don't remember eating any croquettes?  
**Mihono:** Cause I didn't buy any.  
**Mihono:** I mean, wouldn't croquettes for Christmas be weird?  
**Kofuki:** If they're tasty, then buy 'em too\!  
**Mihono:** Well I got us chicken, didn't I\!  
**Chie:** Okay, that's enough, you two.  
**Chie:** Is everyone alright with having Mihono-chan get us chicken again this year?  
**Kofuki:** No complaints here\! Anyway, Mihocchi, where's this place at? Let's go get some croquettes.  
**Mihono:** Let's go make the reservation together then, Fukki.  
**Kofuki:** That works.  
**Kofuki:** While we're at it, let's order a buncha stuff besides chicken. We gotta get croquettes and meatcakes and ham cutlets\!  
**Chie:** Don't go deciding that on your own... That's nothing but fried food. I think I'd better prepare lots of vegetables for us.  

## [Xmas' 20 - Mihono: Start]: The Investigation Team's Christmas Party
On Christmas Day.

  
**Mihono:** HAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Aradama:** Oooo...  
**Mihono:** Even though it's Christmas, we still got a mission\!  
**Kofuki:** What're you complaining about, Mihocchi\! Doesn't this make the best Christmas present\!  
**Kofuki:** I love you\! Aradama-chan\!  
**Aradama:** Aaaa...  
**Mihono:** You're the only one who'd think that, Fukki\!  
**Mihono:** And they're spider types too... That's not the kind of aradama people wanna see on Christmas\!  
**Kofuki:** What kinda aradama do they want to see on Christmas?  
**Mihono:** Like, Kaoru-san's Nene-chan\! There's gotta be people out there who'd want a Christmas version Nenegurumi\!  
**Mihono:** I mean, I'd want one\!  
**Mihono:** But, if Nene-chan attacked me, I couldn't hurt him... What should I do, Fukki\!\?  
**Kofuki:** How am I supposed to know\!  
**Kofuki:** Anyway, the next one's coming\! Quit messing around\!  
**Mihono:** Alright\!  
**Mihono:** [snooze]...  
**Kofuki:** Orah, next one... [snooze]  
**Chie:** Just when we got things set up, they all fell asleep.  
**Mirja:** They had a tough mission. It's understandable.  
**Yui:** Uhehe, uhehe...  
**Kiyoka:** U-ughh...  
**Mirja:** ...Honestly, just what dreams are they having.  
**Chie:** Fufu.  
**Chie:** Since everything's ready, do you want to try a bit of the food?  
**Mirja:** Okay, I will. Though, we should limit it to the salad.  
**Chie:** That's true; they'd all be disappointed if the main dishes ran out.

## [Xmas' 20 - Sanae: Start]: What Should I Go With?
**Sanae:** A Christmas party?  
**Hiyori:** Yeah, Kanami and everyone invited me, but, do you want to come too, Iwakura-san?  
**Sanae:** Thanks for the invitation, Juujou-san.  
**Sanae:** But... Is it really okay for me to be there?  
**Hiyori:** Of course it is.  
**Sanae:** Then, I'd be happy to go.  
**Hiyori:** Great.  
**Hiyori:** Ahh, that's right. We're going to be exchanging gifts that day, so be sure to have one ready.  
**Sanae:** Okay\!  
**Sanae:** ...I said that, but, a gift exchange?  
**Sanae:** Etou-san, Juujou-san, Yanase-san, Itomi-san, Kohagura-san, Mashiko-san...  
**Sanae:** Hmm... What would be good to give them? Would it be okay if I just picked out something I liked?  
**Kiyoka:** Oh, Sanae-san?  
**Sanae:** Musumi-san...  
**Kiyoka:** I didn't expect to see you here\! Are you out shopping?  
**Kiyoka:** The investigation team is having a party on Christmas, so I'm here to buy some things\!  
**Sanae:** I'm sort of in the same boat.  
**Sanae:** I'm going to a party with Juujou-san, but they're going to be doing a gift exchange there, so...  
**Sanae:** ...  
**Sanae:** Could I ask you for a bit of advice on something, Musumi-san?  
**Kiyoka:** Ah, sure, of course. If I can help.  
**Sanae:** You see... I'm actually worried about what to get for the gift exchange. If it were you, what would you buy?  
**Kiyoka:** Hmm... That is a little tough to pick something out for.  
**Kiyoka:** If it were me... Let's see... I think I'd probably go with something consumable or that you could eat.  
**Kiyoka:** Because then, it would be fine no matter who gets it.  
**Sanae:** That makes sense... Thanks, Musumi-san.  
**Kiyoka:** Don't mention it\! Good luck finding the right present\!  
**Sanae:** Yeah.  

## [Xmas' 20 - Sanae: End]: I Don't Feel Like I Can Lose
**Aradama:** OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\!\!  
**Man:** UWAHHHHHHH\!\?  
**Sanae:** HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Man:** Th-Thank you\!  
**Sanae:** Are you hurt anywhere?  
**Man:** I-I'm fine.  
**Sanae:** Thank goodness... Then, please evacuate calmly\!  
**Sanae:** I'll make sure to protect everyone\!  
**Man:** Sure, we're counting on you, miss Toji\!  
**Hiyori:** This turned into one mess of a Christmas.  
**Sanae:** Juujou-san... There's not much we can do about it; aradama don't care if it's Christmas.  
**Sanae:** But, did you finish getting everyone evacuated over there?  
**Hiyori:** Yeah. I came over to help you out, though... it looks like things are fine here.  
**Sanae:** Just about. You should go over to see how the others are doing.  
**Hiyori:** Got it.  
**Hiyori:** Ah, by the way. When we get back, could I give you my present?  
**Sanae:** ...Eh?  
**Hiyori:** We're probably not going to be having a party at this point, but... I'm pretty confident in the present I chose.  
**Sanae:** ...Okay.  
**Sanae:** Ah, could I ask you what you picked out?  
**Hiyori:** Christmas wagashi.  
**Hiyori:** There were lots of cute looking ones, so I had a hard time narrowing it down.  
**Sanae:** I'll bet... I'll look forward to it.  
**Sanae:** And then, I'll trade you my gift, Juujou-san. I went through a lot of ideas, but I settled on a handkerchief...  
**Hiyori:** I'll be sure to take good care of it.  
**Hiyori:** Anyway, I'll see you later.  
**Sanae:** Okay\!  
**Aradama:** GYAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\!\!  
**Sanae:** An aradama\!\?  
**Sanae:** Though... I wonder why. I don't feel like I could lose right now\!

## [Xmas' 20 - Suu: Start]: That's Not It\!
**Suu:** Eh\!\? You're going to be coming here for Christmas?  
**Hokuto:** I am.  
**Suu:** That's great\! Where should we go hang out?  
**Hokuto:** ...You get it, right? I'm going there on a mission, not to hang out.  
**Suu:** Of course I get it\! But, since it's Christmas and all, we should have some fun together\!  
**Hokuto:** ...You're right.  
**Hokuto:** Though, we're going to be training too.  
**Suu:** Ugh... B-But, it's Christmas, right?  
**Hokuto:** That doesn't have anything to do with it. Anyway, I'll be looking forward to it.  
**Suu:** ...\! Okay\!  
On Christmas Day.

  
**Suu:** Ah, my arms and legs feel heavy...  
**Hokuto:** Just after that?  
**Suu:** After that? That was more than hard enough on me\!  
**Hokuto:** ...  
**Hokuto:** Suu, have you been skipping your training?  
**Suu:** Urgh... I-I haven't been skipping it or anything?  
**Hokuto:** Do you mean that?  
**Suu:** Uhh...  
**Hokuto:** ...Suu?  
**Suu:** I haven't\!  
**Suu:** It's just, I might have been going easy on it a little...  
**Hokuto:** Well that explains it. Maybe I'll have to come up with a more intense routine for you.  
**Suu:** More than this\!\?  
**Hokuto:** If you don't want that, then do it properly.  
**Suu:** I got it...  
**Both:** \!\?  
**Suu:** There's aradama, Hokuto-san\!  
**Hokuto:** Right... We're going, Suu\!  
**Suu:** Sure\!  

## [Xmas' 20 - Suu: End]: Aren't You Glad You Worked Hard?
**Aradama:** FSHUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU\!  
**Suu:** Geh, they're spider types\!\?  
**Hokuto:** Is there something wrong with spider types?  
**Suu:** It's not something wrong with them, but... Don't they give you the creeps?  
**Hokuto:** Give me the creeps? They're just aradama, aren't they?  
**Suu:** You're really something, Hokuto-san...  
**Hokuto:** More importantly, I want you to show me how strong you are now, Suu.   
**Suu:** Huh?  
**Hokuto:** If you can't do something in training, you won't be able to do it in combat either. This is a good opportunity... to judge how much you were slacking off.  
**Suu:** I'll try my best\!  
**Suu:** HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Aradama:** Uuuu...  
**Suu:** Alright\!  
**Hokuto:** There's another one further in\! Don't let your guard down\!  
**Suu:** Got it\!  
**Aradama:** FSHUUUU...  
**Hokuto:** --\! Here it comes\!  
**Aradama:** FSHAAAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Suu:** I can handle this much...\! YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Aradama:** Aaaa...  
**Suu:** [pant pant]... Now for the next ones\!  
**Hokuto:** (Suu... You've grown even more than I expected... You might have slacked off a little, but you really are trying.)  
**Hokuto:** You did well, Suu.  
**Suu:** You did great too, Hokuto-san\!  
**Woman:** Um... Thank you very much\! You two were so strong back there.  
**Suu:** Eh, err, not really...  
**Hokuto:** What's wrong?  
**Suu:** I didn't think anybody would be thanking me or anything, so I'm a little embarrassed...  
**Hokuto:** ...It's a good thing you've worked so hard, Suu.  
**Suu:** Yeah\!
