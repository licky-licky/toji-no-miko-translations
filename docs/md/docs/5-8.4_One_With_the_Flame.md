## 11: The Final Battle, Kagutsuchi (1\)
**Mirja:** So then, Asakura Mihono\. How are we meant to defeat Kagutsuchi\?  
**Mihono:** Well that's easy\!  
**Mihono:** It's easy\.\.\. Uh, Kanayamahime\?  
**Kanayamahime:** For that, we would\.\.\. Ah\!\?  
**Mihono:** What's wrong\?  
**Kanayamahime:** Kagutsuchi is watching us here\.  
**Hiyori:** You know where Kagutsuchi is\?  
**Kanayamahime:** I do\.  
**Mirja:** So long as we have Kanayamahime navigating for us, we should be able to reach it then\.  
**Mihono:** Take us there, Kanayamahime\!  
**Kanayamahime:** Kagutsuchi lies beyond here\.  
**Mihono:** Eh\? Where is it\? I can't see\.\.\. Huh\?  
**Mihono:** Wait, where'd everybody go\!\?  
**Hiyori:** Looks like we lost them coming here\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** (Or\.\.\. it's possible that she was trying to split us up from the start\.\.\.\)  
**Kanayamahime:** Should we return to the world, Mihono\?  
**Mihono:** If we go back\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** (Guess I'm overthinking it\.\)  
**Kanami:** Hiyori-chan\?  
**Hiyori:** It's nothing; forget it\.  
**Hiyori:** Mihono, there's no need for us to go back\. Either way, we should be able to fight it with the 5 of us here\.  
**Hiyori:** Isn't that right\?  
**Kanayamahime:** It is\.  
**Mihono:** So we won't be fighting with everybody\.\.\.  
**Akira:** Feeling scared\?  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.I'm a little bit scared\.  
**Mihono:** I'd feel better if everybody else was here too\.\.\. I'm not sure if we can win if it's just us\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** We should be fine\!  
**Mihono:** Kanami\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** We're all pretty strong\. If it's us 5\.\.\. We'll beat it for sure\!  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.Yeah, we'll beat Kagutsuchi together\.  
**Mihono:** Let's go\! Where there's a will, there's a way\!  

## 12: The Final Battle, Kagutsuchi (2\)
**Mihono:** Where is this\.\.\.\?  
**Mihono:** Is that my home that's burning\.\.\.\!\?  
**Kanami:** Calm down, Mihono-chan\! Kagutsuchi's just making it look that way\!  
**Kanami:** More importantly\.\.\. Look at that\!  
**Mihono:** That's, Kagutsuchi\.\.\.\!  
**Akira:** It's freakin' huge\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** Losing your nerve\?  
**Akira:** Other way around\! Haha\! This's the best\!  
**Akira:** Just the kind of fight that comes once in a lifetime\!  
**Akira:** ORRRAAAAAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Hiyori:** Hey\! She's off on her own\.\.\. Kanami\! I'm going to back her up\!  
**Kanami:** Okay\!  
**Kanami:** Mihono-chan\! Let's go in too\!  
**Mihono:** Alright\! Kanayamahime\!  
**Kanayamahime:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.Kanayamahime\?  
**Kanayamahime:** Please move away from me\.  
**Mihono:** Huh\?  
**Kanami:** Kagutsuchi's trying to get Kanayamahime\!  
**Kanayamahime:** Kagutsuchi seems to be trying to consume me and complete its strength\.  
**Mihono:** I'm not letting it\!  
**Mihono:** You're staying with me, not with Kagutsuchi\!  
**Kanayamahime:** Mihono\.\.\. Thank you\.  
**Kanami:** You'll be fine if you're with Mihono-chan, Kanayamahime\.  
**Mihono:** Yeah\! I'm not letting Kagutsuchi or anybody have you\!  
**Akira:** [pant\.\.\. pant\.\.\. pant\.\.\.\]  
**Mihono:** YAAAAAAAAAAAHH\!\!  
**Kanami:** We'll help, Mihono-chan\! Hiyori-chan\!  
**Hiyori:** You don't even have to ask\!  
**Kanami:** \.\.\.It's attacking\! Be on guard\.\.\.  
**Akira:** UAAAAAAAAAAGHHH\!  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.Gh, everyone alright\?  
**Kanami:** Yeah\! I can keep on fighting\!  
**Mihono:** I think I can manage too\! But, Akira-san\!\?  
**Akira:** You don't gotta worry about me\!  
**Akira:** [pant\.\.\. pant\.\.\. pant\.\.\.\]  
**Akira:** \.\.\.You've gotten tough, Mihono\. Compared to that\.\.\. Ggh\.\.\.  
**Akira:** (I can't go on much more\.\.\.\)  
**Akira:** (Ever since fighting the special defense team, I've been leaning nonstop on this suit\.\.\.\)  
**Akira:** But hey, there'd be no point coming this far if I just up and backed off now\!  
**Akira:** MIHONO\!\!  
**Mihono:** Y-Yeah\!\?  
**Akira:** I'm gonna keep the pressure on that big thing\! So you'd better hurry up and exorcise the hell out of it\!  
**Akira:** ORRRAAAAAAAAAAAHHH\!\!  
**Akira:** Gagh\.\.\.\!  
Like that'll, do, ANYTHIIIIIIIIIIINNGG\!\!

  
**Hiyori:** Idiot\! You're at your limit, aren't you\!\?  
**Akira:** You don't get to tell me where my limit's at\!  
**Akira:** This's the only way\.\.\. I know how to fight\!  
**Akira:** Just push up and put yourself on the line\!  
**Hiyori:** You can't just tough your way through everything\!  
**Hiyori:** What's with her\.\.\. Is she trying to get herself killed\!\?  
**Mihono:** (Akira-san\.\.\.\)  
**Mihono:** We have to finish this right here\.  
**Kanami:** Mihono-chan\?  
**Mihono:** The five of us are just barely fighting it off\.  
**Mihono:** If we lose Akira-san, I don't think we can win this\.  
**Mihono:** So, we're going to finish this right now\!  
**Hiyori:** I'm all for it, but\.\.\. how are we going to do that\?  
**Mihono:** You and Kanami will help Akira-san and make an opening\.  
**Mihono:** And then\.\.\. Kanayamahime and me will beat Kagutsuchi\.  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.Can you do it\?  
**Mihono:** Don't worry about it\.  
**Mihono:** Right, Kanayamahime\?  
**Kanayamahime:** We can\.  
**Kanami:** \.\.\.Alright\.  
**Kanami:** Let's go, Hiyori-chan\.  
**Hiyori:** Fine then, I'll be with you\.  
**Kanami:** Sure\!  
**Kanami/Hiyori:** HAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH\!\!  
**Mihono:** Kanayamahime\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** We'll give it one last flash with everything we've got\!  

## 13: The Final Battle, Kagutsuchi (3\)
**Mihono:** Just a little more and we'll have our chance\!  
**Akira:** Kagutsuchi's started screaming back too\!  
**Akira:** GAAAAAAAAGHHH\!  
**Hiyori:** It's putting up a last ditch effort\!\?  
**Akira:** BASTAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRDD\!\!  
**Akira:** \.\.\.But, I see it\!  
**Kanami:** Mihono-chan\! Now it's your turn\!\!  
**Mihono:** Kanayamahime\!  
**Kanayamahime:** Yes, Mihono\!  
**Mihono/Kanayamahime:** YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH\!\!  

## 14: The End of a Long Night (1\)
**Mihono:** Did we win\.\.\.\?  
**Mihono:** Kanayamahime\.\.\.\!\?  
**Kanami:** Her body's fading\.\.\.  
**Kanayamahime:** Please leave here at once\.  
**Kanayamahime:** This space will soon be gone\.  
**Mihono:** Then\.\.\. you're coming with us too\!  
**Kanayamahime:** There is no need\.  
**Kanayamahime:** It's begun to collapse\.  
**Kanayamahime:** Please go quickly now\.  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.\! Let's go\!  
**Akira:** \.\.\.  
**Kanayamahime:** Will you not leave\?  
**Akira:** You saved me\. I'm never gonna forget it\.  
**Kanayamahime:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Akira:** What's that look for\!\!  
**Kanayamahime:** It's somewhat\.\.\. unexpected\.  
**Akira:** \.\.\.Bye then\.  
**Kanayamahime:** Yes\.  
**Kanami:** I wish we could've been friends, Kanayamahime\.  
**Kanayamahime:** Friends\.\.\.\?  
**Kanami:** Yeah, like with Mihono-chan\.  
**Kanayamahime:** \.\.\.Thank you\.  
**Mihono:** Kanayamahime\.\.\.  
**Kanayamahime:** Please go with them, Mihono\.  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.\.\.\.I don't think I can after all\.  
**Mihono:** You have to come with me, Kanayamahime\!  
**Kanayamahime:** But, I am\.\.\.   
**Mihono:** Still\!  
**Mihono:** Even still, you want to be together with me, don't you\!\?  
**Mihono:** That's what you wanted, wasn't it\?  
**Mihono:** So then, let's be together\!  
**Kanayamahime:** \.\.\.Thank you very much, Mihono\.  
**Kanayamahime:** These last moments\.\.\. I will be with you\.  
**Kanami:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** Let's get going, Mihono-chan\.  
**Mihono:** Yeah\.  
**Kofuki:** It's morning already\. How long's she gonna take\!\?  
**Kiyoka:** Hono-chan\.\.\.  
**Chie:** Let's have faith in her\. I'm sure that\.\.\. Mihono-chan and the others will be fine\.  
**Mirja:** Asakura Mihono\.\.\.  
**Yui:** \.\.\.Huh\? Just now, I heard a voice\.\.\.\?  
**Ellen:** Everyone, shhhh\!  
**Everyone:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** We're back, everybody\!  

## 15: The End of a Long Night (2\)
**Akira:** \.\.\.\.\.\.And that's how it went\. We smacked the hell out of Kagutsuchi\.  
**Makoto:** You fought well, Akira-chan\.  
**Makoto:** So then, Kanayamahime disappeared\?  
**Akira:** Nah, about that, she's not totally gone somehow\.  
**Akira:** Mihono's happy about it at least\.\.\.  
**Makoto:** \.\.\.  
**Makoto:** The Atago\.\.\. no, the long time the Asakura spent with Kanayamahime may have transformed her\.  
**Akira:** What do you mean\?  
**Makoto:** Perhaps Kagutsuchi in the netherworld and Kanayamahime in our world were on the brink of becoming separate entities\.  
**Makoto:** What about Kanayamahime now\?  
**Akira:** Well, she's sleeping inside of Mihono\.  
**Akira:** Doesn't seem like Mihono can use Kanayamahime's powers anymore either, so it's like it all went back to normal\.  
**Makoto:** \.\.\.I suppose that's the optimal outcome for us\.  
**Akira:** Yeah\. So long as we have Mihono and Kanayamahime, we've got a lot better chances of finding a cure\.  
**Makoto:** Though\.\.\. For the time being, things will likely be very busy with Asakura-san\.  
**Akira:** Guess she won't be coming around here for a while\.  
**Akira:** \.\.\.What about Yuuki\?  
**Makoto:** It seems she's in Origami Akane-sama's custody\.  
**Akira:** \.\.\.You cool with that\? They're gonna take data on tamayori\.  
**Makoto:** I don't mind\. It would be nice if there were a different approach from the one we've taken\.  
**Akira:** Yeah\. Well, so long as Yuuki's safe, I don't mind either\.  
**Akira:** \.\.\.I'm beat\. I'll leave the noro with you, so take care of the rest for me\.  
**Makoto:** I will\.  
**Makoto:** Goodnight\.\.\. Akira-chan\. I hope you sleep soundly\.  
**Akira:** I'll probably be sleeping in late tomorrow, but don't wake me up, Makocchan\.  
**Makoto:** Fufu\. Okay, I won't\.  
**Makoto:** \.\.\.Now then, while Akira-chan rests, I'll do some maintenance\.\.\. and I'll set aside the data from the battle with Kagutsuchi\.  
**Makoto:** \.\.\.\?  
**Makoto:** I thought I heard something just now\.\.\.  
**Makoto:** Ugh\.\.\. What's that\.\.\.  
**\?\?\?:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Makoto:** Ugh\.\.\. Ah\.\.\.  
**Makoto:** The noro\.\.\.\!\? It shouldn't be active\! Why is\.\.\.  
**\?\?\?:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Makoto:** Ah\.\.\. Aa\.\.\.  
**Makoto:** AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Makoto\?:** \.\.\.  
**Makoto\?:** Hitakami Makoto\.\.\. This should\.\.\. do fine\.\.\.  
**Makoto\?:** Kanayamahime\.\.\. sleeping within Asakura Mihono\.\.\.  
**Makoto\?:** \.\.\.I will have you back\.\.\.  
**Other:** Missing Power  
**Mihono:** Mmmm\.  
**Kanami:** What's wrong, Mihono-chan\?  
**Mihono:** Ah-- Kanami\.  
**Mihono:** See, for some reason, I can't use Kanayamahime's power anymore\.  
**Kanami:** Huh\?  
**Mihono:** Is it cause she's sleeping again\?  
**Mihono:** NNGG-\!\!\!\!  
**Mihono:** See\?  
**Kanami:** I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to see, but\.\.\. that sounds bad\.  
**Mihono:** Hmm\.\.\. It's not really that bad, I think\.  
**Kanami:** Even though you can't use her powers\?  
**Mihono:** Yeah\.  
**Mihono:** Cause it's not like Kanayamahime's totally gone, so, well, I'm just back to my old self\.  
**Mihono:** But, that means the gap between you and me just got wider again\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** \.\.\.\.\.\.Don't worry about that\.  
**Kanami:** I know you'll get stronger again, Mihono-chan\.  
**Mihono:** Yeah maybe\.  
**Mihono:** Where there's a will there's a way\! I'll keep at it some more-\!
