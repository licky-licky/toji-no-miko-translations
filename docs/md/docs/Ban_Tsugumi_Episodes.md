## 1: Efficiency Above All
**Mihono:** Tsugumi-san, delivery for youuu\!  
**Kanami:** Ehehe, I tagged along too.  
**Tsugumi:** Asakura-san and Etou-san? I'm sure I asked Shichinosato-san to bring me that package though?  
**Mihono:** Fukki said "I don't think I want anything to do with this", gave it to us, and ran off.  
**Tsugumi:** Ah, she got suspicious.  
**Kanami:** Of what, Tsugumi-san?  
**Tsugumi:** Oh, nothing, only talking to myself. Thank you for bringing that here in Shichinosato-san's place. Could you place it over here?  
**Mihono:** Sure, heave ho.  
**Mihono:** What's all this for, by the way? All these ingredients, herbs, spices, these weird supplements; there sure is a whole lot of stuff...  
**Tsugumi:** Oh, these? With these, first you place the ingredients and what have you in the blender...  
**Tsugumi:** Sprinkle all the supplements in here as well...  
**Tsugumi:** And there you have it. All that's left is to fill it into vacuum packs, write the dates, and it's done.  
**Mihono:** U-Uhh...?ã€€  
**Kanami:** Is it some kind of drug for your aradama research...?  
**Tsugumi:** No, these are my meals for the week.  
**Kanami/Mihono:** EHHHH-\!\?  
**Tsugumi:** When there's time, I do eat solid foods, but during busy hours in the lab, this can provide me with all the nutrition of a full meal.  
**Kanami:** Mihono-chan, does that look tasty to you...?  
**Mihono:** I-I don't know...  
**Tsugumi:** If you're interested, why not try it? I ordered a surplus of ingredients this time, thinking I would offer some to Shichinosato-san.  
**Mihono:** Should we eat it, Kanami?  
**Kanami:** U-Ummm...  
**Tsugumi:** There's no reason to be concerned; every ingredient in there is perfectly healthy. And I've proven its effectiveness with my own body.  
**Kanami:** Then... It's a little off-putting, but we might as well...  
**Mihono:** If you're in, then I am too...  
**Tsugumi:** Here you are then. Please gulp it all down.  
**Mihono:** ...Ah\!  
**Mihono:** H-Huh...? What were we doing here again...?  
**Kanami:** You know, I don't know... What did we come here for?  
**Mihono:** Mmmm, I can't remember...  
**Mihono:** But I'm feeling all fired up\! Like I'm bursting with energy\!  
**Kanami:** Yeah, I feel it too, Mihono-chan\! Hey hey, want to go to the dojo and train together?  
**Mihono:** Great idea\! I feel like I can't sit still for some reason\! Let's go right now\!  
**Tsugumi:** When the two of them collapsed, I wasn't sure what would happen, but I'm glad to see that both are fine.  
**Tsugumi:** Though, I don't think it's so bad that they should lose their short-term memory...  
**Tsugumi:** Mm, as I thought, it tastes the same as usual.  

## 2: The Poker Faces of Renpu
**Tsugumi:** ......  
**Yomi:** ......  
**Sayaka:** ......  
**Tsugumi:** She's very late, isn't she? President Takatsu. Preparations for the mock battle were finished quite some time ago.  
**Yomi:** Yes, she's later than the scheduled time. Itomi-san, we should warm up once more.  
**Sayaka:** Understood.  
**Tsugumi:** Oh, is that your phone, Satsuki-san?  
**Yomi:** It's President Takatsu calling.  
**Yomi:** Yes............. Yes.  
**Yomi:** Today's mock battle has been cancelled. Itomi-san and I are dismissed, Ban-san is to continue with her lab work.  
**Tsugumi:** Cancelled? Something urgent must have gotten her attention.  
**Yomi:** That's how it seems. Now, I will return to Yukari-sama.  
**Tsugumi:** Hm... She made us wait so long, yet you don't seem bothered by it. You have quite the poker face, Satsuki-san.  
**Tsugumi:** In fact, I get that a lot myself. People tell me they can't read my expressions.  
**Sayaka:** Tsugumi.  
**Tsugumi:** Yes? What is it, Itomi-san?  
**Sayaka:** Kaoru said I had a poker face before too.  
**Tsugumi:** I see. That means, all of us gathered here have been told we have poker faces at one point.  
**Tsugumi:** That being the case. Why don't we try something to outgrow our poker faces?  
**Yomi:** To outgrow it...?  
**Sayaka:** Try what?  
**Tsugumi:** Try practicing smiling, of course. A strong smile is a fundamental of social interaction.  
**Sayaka:** If I smile, will Kaoru not call me poker face?  
**Tsugumi:** I believe so. Well, that's my proposal, but I'd like if you joined us, Satsuki-san.  
**Yomi:** ...Very well.  
**Tsugumi:** Then, we'll all practice together. On the count of 3... 3, 2, 1.  
**Kofuki:** Oiii, let me play with the aradama-chan again... The hell are you guys doing?  
**Sayaka:** This is smile practice...  
**Yomi:** Mm......  
**Tsugumi:** How is it? Are we smiling well?  
**Tsugumi:** Please share your thoughts, Shichinosato-san.  
**Kofuki:** Uh, I don't really know what to say... When you're making that face, it just looks like you're up to no good. And Sayaka and Yomi-senpai are lost causes.  
**Sayaka:** I failed.  
**Yomi:** It's not something that can be improved in a day, is it. I'll be returning to my duties then.  
**Tsugumi:** Of course. Let's practice together again sometime.  

## 3: Scouting
**Hamatsuka Sakura:** H-Hello... Ban-senpai, it's Hamatsuka...  
**Tsugumi:** Ah, I've been expecting you, Hamatsuka-san. I'd like to ask for your help treating an injury, if that's alright?  
**Sakura:** Of course, I'll gladly help, but... I thought Shichinosato-san got hurt again, but, you're the one injured today, Ban-senpai...?  
**Tsugumi:** There's a presentation on aradama research coming up, have you heard?  
**Sakura:** Yes, I heard someone mention it... I'm going to disinfect the wound, alright? This may sting a little...  
**Tsugumi:** Urgh... The antiseptic is working its way into the cut...  
**Tsugumi:** ...Shichonosato-san has been busy with the investigation team lately. So I thought I'd work to collect data as well, but you can see how it turned out.  
**Sakura:** ...Please be careful of your own limits. It's only a light cut this time, but you could have been seriously injured...  
**Tsugumi:** Thank you for worrying about me, Hamatsuka-san.  
**Tsugumi:** Considering how this turned out, it seems I do in fact need a helper. Well, I can stop here and try scouting a promising toji.  
**Tsugumi:** With that in mind, I've joined an aradama suppression mission to scout the so-called ace of the next generation, Nagasaki Sumi...  
**Fujimaki Minaki:** Nn? What's up, Tsugumi-senpai?  
**Nagasaki Sumi:** Am I maybe too tall for you to see past me...? Uuu, I'm sorry then...\!  
**Tsugumi:** Oh no, I didn't say anything like that. I was only speaking to myself, so please, pay me no mind. More importantly, please keep watching ahead.  
**Aradama:** SHAAAAAA\!  
**Minaki:** Oh, we found the aradama\! Tsugumi-senpai, you stay with Sumicchi\!  
**Tsugumi:** So she says. I will provide support. Please do whatever you feel is best, Nagasaki-san.  
**Sumi:** Right\!  
**Tsugumi:** (Now then, let's see what Nagasaki-san is capable of.)  
**Tsugumi:** Nagasaki-san, an aradama is approaching from the right. I will do a feint, so will you please finish it off.  
**Sumi:** Okay\! I understand\! DEEEIIH\~\!  
**Tsugumi:** (I had heard she was an apprehensive person, but in combat, she doesn't seem intimidated.)  
**Minaki:** Nice going, Sumicchi\! Alright, I can't let you do all the work\!  
**Tsugumi:** (Hm, I cannot ignore Fujimaki-san's communication skills either. By having her around, things are progressing smoothly. Perhaps I can try aiming for a two man set of helpers here.)  
**Tsugumi:** With that decided, all that's needed is for us to clear out the remaining aradama.  
**Sumi:** Thank you very much, Ban-senpai\! It was so easy maneuvering with your help\!  
**Tsugumi:** My primary role is acting as an operator, after all. Besides, you're also as impressive as the rumors suggested, Nagasaki-san.  
**Sumi:** Rumors...? Huh-\!\? Don't tell me, rumors about my height have spread as far as you, senpai\!\?  
**Minaki:** Ahahaha\! You sure are cute, Sumicchi\! Even though you're so tall\!  
**Sumi:** Uuu, I got called tall again...  
**Tsugumi:** You may be lacking in confidence though, Nagasaki-san.  
**Sumi:** It's not something to be confident about though... It's no good, being this tall...  
**Tsugumi:** There are some occupations that seek out taller people. For example, modeling.  
**Sumi:** Modeling\!\?  
**Tsugumi:** Yes. Whether or not you plan on becoming a future model, I happen to be looking for a model of my own... Would you be interested?  
**Sumi:** Me, a model, me... I-I'll try my best\!  
**Minaki:** Sumicchi's going to be a model? That sounds like a fun time\! Tsugumi-senpai\! I wanna give it a shot too\!  
**Tsugumi:** Of course, by all means.  
**Tsugumi:** (What I need is a model case in aradama suppression data, but I would be lying if I said that wasn't a form of modeling in its own right.)  
**Tsugumi:** Phew, with this, I should be able to make it before the presentation.  

## 4: Beyond Aradama Research
**Mirja:** ...I believe the laboratory is this way. I'll pay a visit then.  
**Tsugumi:** Well, if it isn't Kitora-san. What brings you here? Are you looking for Shichinosato-san?  
**Mirja:** No, I'm here to speak to you. There's something I would like to ask you.  
**Mirja:** (Ban Tsugumi, second year in high school at Renpu Girls' School... A person with an accomplished past as a toji, a member of the aradama research team, and acting operator for mock battles...)  
**Mirja:** (It's said she has great skills of observation, so let's see...)  
**Mirja:** Would that be fine with you? It shouldn't take much of your time.  
**Tsugumi:** Of course, go right ahead.  
**Tsugumi:** If it's about how to handle Shichinosato-san, I can answer any of your questions.  
**Mirja:** ...I'm surprised you could tell.  
**Tsugumi:** Shichinosato-san isn't the type to listen to orders, so I assume she's been giving you a hard time.  
**Mirja:** I'll get right to the point then. Could you hear me out?  
**Tsugumi:** Certainly, I'll help as much as I can.  
**Mirja:** I've heard you have been together with Shichinosato Kofuki for a long time. And that you are skilled at managing her.  
**Mirja:** As far as I am aware, the only other person capable of doing that is Setouchi Chie. However, I cannot copy her results.  
**Mirja:** That being the case, is there any technique you can teach me that would prevent Shichinosato Kofuki from causing problems?  
**Tsugumi:** A technique to stop her causing problems?  
**Tsugumi:** I don't really do anything like that. She and I just share a common interest... To sound like Shichinosato-san, "I hella love aradama-chan too\!\"  
**Mirja:** I-Is that so...  
**Tsugumi:** Just so there isn't any confusion, my interest isn't in combat with aradama like Shichinosato-san's, but with the very existence of aradama themselves.  
**Tsugumi:** To me, combat with aradama is only if it's absolutely necessary.  
**Mirja:** I see... Though it feels somewhat wasteful. I had heard you had an impressive record as a toji. Do you not have any plans of returning to that role?  
**Tsugumi:** I wouldn't mind going back to it now and then, but this has my priority now. I've set my sights on a big dream.  
**Mirja:** A big dream? What would that be?  
**Tsugumi:** Fufu, would you believe me if I said a Nobel Peace Prize?  
**Mirja:** With your research on aradama...?  
**Tsugumi:** ...Yes. I'd like to be awarded one through researching aradama.  
**Mirja:** I didn't know... In that case, it's not surprising you get along well with Shichinosato Kofuki.  
**Tsugumi:** I'm quite the odd specimen myself.  
**Mirja:** Still, it's a fascinating subject. I never would have imagined a Nobel Peace Prize going to someone in aradama research.  
**Tsugumi:** It's hard for me to picture too. But, don't you think the fun in life comes from challenging the impossible?  
**Tsugumi:** That's why, understanding how impossible she can be, please do your best in getting along with Shichinosato-san.  
**Mirja:** In getting along with Shichinosato Kofuki... Fufu, I suppose you're right. I'll try remaining patient and straightforward with her.  

## 5: Meeting Kofuki
That was two years ago-- I was still a toji in the thick of the action then.

  
The problem child, Shichinosato Kofuki, was infamous among the toji of Renpu Girls' School.

  
They call her the walking order violation. The aradama-chan junkie. The two-fanged mad dog.

  
That girl had been passed off from unit to unit, until finally being assigned to mine, where none of the toji would approach her.

  
Until I offered to be her partner that day.

  
**Tsugumi:** It's our first time teaming up like this, isn't it.  
**Kofuki:** ......  
**Tsugumi:** By the way, do you like fighting aradama, Shichinosato-san?  
**Kofuki:** ......  
**Tsugumi:** Hello? Did you not hear me? Hello in there\~\? Do you like fighting aradama, Shichinosato-san?  
**Kofuki:** ...\! Fuck off, so what if I do? You gonna give me the cold shoulder like the rest of them?  
**Tsugumi:** No no, you don't have to worry about that. If anything, you could say I'm burning with curiosity.  
**Kofuki:** I don't care either way\! Tch, why'd I have to be stuck with you...\!  
**Kofuki:** Let's get this straight; just cause you're my senpai doesn't mean I'm gonna do what you tell me. If any aradama-chan show up, I'm doing things my way.  
**Tsugumi:** Of course, I don't have a problem with that.  
**Kofuki:** Huh? You sure?  
**Tsugumi:** Yes. If that's what produces results, then go right ahead.  
**Tsugumi:** Ah, aradama sighted\! You're up, Shichinosato-san, go, go, go\!  
**Kofuki:** Haha\! Finally, a senpai that has the right idea\!  
**Kofuki:** Pant, pant, pant... Heh, hehe, ten, nah, twenty of 'em I think...?  
**Tsugumi:** Nineteen, to be exact. Either way, very nicely done.  
**Kofuki:** Pant, pant... You didn't even try to jump in, did you?  
**Tsugumi:** Of course not. That was our agreement. I did take care of the three that came my way though.  
**Kofuki:** You've got some screws loose, you know...  
**Kofuki:** But, so long as I get to do whatever I want like this, how about we be partners on the next mission too?  
**Tsugumi:** I'm sorry to say that this was my last mission. I'm retiring from the front lines and being assigned to a research team.  
**Kofuki:** Wha...  
**Kofuki:** The hell... You got my hopes up a little...  
**Tsugumi:** Would you like to come with me? Shichinosato-san.  
**Kofuki:** What?  
**Tsugumi:** I'll be acting as operator for the aradama research team, but they still haven't found anyone to cover the practical side of the combat testing.  
**Tsugumi:** Hardly surprising with such a difficult role, having to kill countless aradama day after day... Is there really anyone out there who would take such an awful position...?  
**Kofuki:** You were after this all along, weren't you... You should've said something sooner\!  
And that's how I met Shichinosato-san.

  
Our current relationship? If I had to say, I don't think it's going too badly.

  
**Tsugumi Joins - Part 1:** Must-Have Data  
**Sayaka:** Kofuki... Good work.  
**Kofuki:** Mann, that's another day I got to mess around with so many aradama-chan.  
**Sayaka:** You weren't messing around... It was a mission.  
**Kofuki:** Whatever, it's the same thing.  
**Tsugumi:** Oh, hello, Itomi-san, Shichinosato-san. Back from suppressing aradama?  
**Kofuki:** Yep. Got a whole lot of combat data out of it too. Can't even remember how many I beat.  
**Tsugumi:** I'm glad to hear it, but why did you suppress so many?  
**Kofuki:** The other toji got colds or the flu or something and couldn't show up.  
**Sayaka:** Kofuki and I have been called to take their place.  
**Tsugumi:** Ahh, that's why. I've never had the flu myself, but it sounds serious.  
**Kofuki:** You know, even though you don't look healthy, I've never seen you getting sick before.  
**Tsugumi:** I maintain proper nutrition and sleeping hours; a necessity if your want to get good research done.  
**Sayaka:** I eat a lot of Mai's cookies and sleep a lot too.  
**Kofuki:** Sayaka... What are you ganging up on me for?  
**Tsugumi:** Anyway, I now understand the reason you haven't been joining in mock battles lately, Shichinosato-san.  
**Kofuki:** That's cause fresh aradama-chan are the best\! I'll take them any day over the ones we get in testing\!  
**Sayaka:** They're calling me for dinner. Kofuki, Tsugumi... Bye.  
**Kofuki:** Better not catch a cold. Actually, don't worry about it, cause if you do, I get all your aradama-chans.  
**Tsugumi:** Now then, why don't we get something to eat too?  
**Kofuki:** When you say "something", you mean one of those packs full of whatever you tossed in the blender, right... I don't want any.  
**Tsugumi:** I think they're quite effective at warding off colds, but I won't force you.  
**Tsugumi:** There is something I would like to confirm with you though, and it's cold out here, so would you mind coming to the lab before you go eat?  
**Kofuki:** If you say so.  
**Tsugumi:** I'm starting to gather data on which parts of an aradama can efficiently disable it if they are cut--  
**Kofuki:** Now, I asked to aim for the part that seems to be the head... But do you think that's too difficult?  
**Tsugumi:** Ask all you want, but when things are getting serious, it's gonna be impossible to aim just for the head.  
**Tsugumi:** That's a reasonable opinion. I'd asked others as well, but wasn't having good results.  
**Kofuki:** Well, it's true that some of them just drop dead as soon as you crack open their head though.  
**Tsugumi:** I'm sorry; I know it's unreasonable.  
**Tsugumi:** Just because I want this data doesn't mean I can expose other toji to danger...  
**Kofuki:** I mean, if I have the time, I'll try playing along and see what happens. Anyway, I'm gonna get some food.  
**Tsugumi:** Of course. I'll see you later.  
**Tsugumi:** With this case, it may be better to collect some data myself first.  
**Tsugumi:** But, where to begin... Sip... Sip...  
**Tsugumi:** These nutrition packs seem just as tasty as ordinary food to me... Sip... Sip...  
**Tsugumi Joins - Part 2:** Give and Take  
**Tsugumi:** Oh, it's already 1:00... I should get ready for bed.  
**Tsugumi:** Though, aradama clearly don't care if it's the dead of night. What should I do; this is a perfect chance to gather some data.  
**Tsugumi:** If Shichinosato-san goes along, the aradama will likely be killed before any data can be gathered on attacks to the head... Hmmm.  
**Tsugumi:** Well, I suppose there's no other option.  
**Kofuki:** Damnit... You can't just tell me to get ready in 40 seconds\! Gimme more time than that.  
**Tsugumi:** Mm... And just when I went out of my way to share information on an aradama appearance with you. Well, if I had left without saying anything, you might have sensed it on your own.  
**Kofuki:** What am I, an aradama radar\!\?  
**Kofuki:** But I guess you did get this playground ready for me, so I do owe you one.  
**Tsugumi:** Good, I'm counting on you.  
**Aradama:** GGGIIIIII...\!  
**Kofuki:** Even if you're just a little baby aradama-chan, you've got my attention tonight\!  
**Aradama:** GUOOooo...  
**Tsugumi:** One strike to the head, well done. Slow and steady progress is the key to data collection.  
**Kofuki:** There's a bigger one round here too, right? Where is it?  
**Tsugumi:** Let's get going then. Over that way.  
**Kofuki:** "That way"...? Why're you pointing off into the sky? Oi, where are we going?  
**Kofuki:** So the main attraction's that bigass bird looking aradama-chan?  
**Tsugumi:** Correct. I asked the unit on duty tonight if they could guide it here.  
**Kofuki:** Is that right.  
**Kofuki:** If that thing came flying up at us, it'd be pretty easy aiming for the head, wouldn't it?  
**Tsugumi:** Well, that's one way of looking at it, fufu.  
**Kofuki:** Hahah\! You want this aradama-chan data that badly, huh\! Fine, I'll go and get it for you\!  
**Tsugumi:** Then, please concentrate on your attack.  
**Kofuki:** Of course\! C'mon, aradama-chan, show me a good time\!  
**Aradama:** GUGGGIII... SHAAAAAAA\!  
**Tsugumi:** (If the structure of an aradama is similar to that of a living creature, I believe a blow to the head could effectively finish it.)  
**Tsugumi:** (However, the reason aradama resemble living creatures is still unclear. Additionally, more data is neccessary to determine whether blows to the head are a more efficient means of suppression.)  
**Tsugumi:** (I would like to continue collecting data on this case and make a better judgment from the findings. However, to avoid exposing toji to unnecessary risks, I believe it will take some time.)  
**Tsugumi:** Phew... That should do for now.  
**Tsugumi:** If I'm being honest, it's an awfully rough hypothesis. But, considering the help I've been given, I hope the results will be worth it.

## [Xmas' 19 - Tsugumi: Start]: With Our Caroling
**Mihono:** Wow-\! Come take a look\! There's so many tasty looking cakes\!  
**Kofuki:** Whoa\! This pudding looks good as hell\!  
**Mirja:** Asakura Mihono, Shichinosato Kofuki, we did not come here today to eat cakes.  
**Tsugumi:** We're here to rent choir costumes for the Christmas Eve party, remember?  
**Mihono:** Ahh, oh yeah. Sorry about that. The cakes just looked so good I couldn't help it.  
**Tsugumi:** You know, you wouldn't think it outside, but this cafe is fairly expansive, isn't it. The interior design has a meticulous feeling to it as well.  
**Mirja:** It's meant to be a popular cosplay cafe that allows you to enjoy meals while dressed in costumes specially selected by the cafe owner.  
**Mihono:** That sounds fun\! Since we're here already, want to have some tea together?  
**Tsugumi:** I would love to do that, Asakura-san, but don't you think it would be best to use our spare time practicing singing our carols?  
**Mihono:** Oh yeah\! We haven't even practiced at all yet, have we. We've gotta back to school as soon as we get the costumes.  
**Kofuki:** Geh, it's just a party between friends, so nobody'll care if we phone it in, right?  
**Mirja:** That won't do. Shichinosato Kofuki. You have an obligation to entertain the party, as compensation for eating my pudding the other day without asking.  
**Tsugumi:** Shichinosato-san, if you don't want to sing, you could always replace Kitora-san's pudding. Though, that pudding was a highly rare limited item. There's no guarantee you'd be able to find another...  
**Kofuki:** Tch\! Whatever. I'll do it, alright? If that's what it takes, I'm gonna sing my heart out\!  
**Cafe Owner:** Thank you for waiting. You girls are the choir group that was coming, aren't you? If you're going to be singing at a Christmas party, I think these costumes would be a good fit, but what do you say?  
**Mihono:** Whoa-\! They're cute\! I'd be happy getting to sing wearing something this nice\!  
**Tsugumi:** From the careful stitching to the elaborate decorations, these are fantastic costumes. Will you really lend something this finely crafted to us free of charge?  
**Mirja:** They won't be free, of course. The condition was that we repay them with labor.  
**Kofuki:** We've gotta work for it\!\? Nobody said anything about that-\!  
**Tsugumi:** Kitora-san, what will we need to do as payment?  
**Mihono:** Don't tell me, after the party's over, we'll have to wash dishes here forever...  
**Cafe Owner:** Relax, I wouldn't ask for something so severe. What I'd like for you to do is perform your carols here at our shop. How does that sound?  
**Mirja:** On the 25th, when we return these costumes, this cafe will be hosting a Christmas event. There, you will wear your costumes and sing carols.  
**Mihono:** That's it? That'll be easy then\! Right, Fukki?  
**Kofuki:** Yeah, I'm glad to hear they're not breaking our backs over it. Singing's no big deal; I can sing as many songs as they want.  
**Mirja:** We have an agreement then. On the toji party on the 24th, and here at the cafe event on the 25th, please do your best to liven up both events with your caroling.  
**Mihono/Tsugumi:** Okay\!  
**Mihono:** Just when we felt like practicing, they told us we can't use the music room. It's too bad, isn't it-.  
**Tsugumi:** There's nothing we could do about it. The chorus club is putting in their final preparations for the end of the year choir event.  
**Kofuki:** So, where do we start with practicing carols now?   
**Tsugumi:** First, to understand what position we're starting from, why don't we sing through our songs?  
**Mihono:** Okaaay\! Then, I'll put on the background music CD, so let's sing along with it\!  
**Mihono/Tsugumi/Kofuki:** [singing]  
**Tsugumi:** Hmm, I'm sorry to say this, but we don't exactly have the voices of angels, do we.  
**Kofuki:** With the two of you going all into falsetto, we weren't getting anywhere near enough volume\!  
**Tsugumi:** That's true; because we're singing in a different register than usual, we may need to train our throats more.  
**Tsugumi:** Ah\! I've just thought of something good\! Let's move our practice to tomorrow. I'll prepare a special medicine for us by then.  
**Mihono:** A-A special medicine\!\?  
**Kofuki:** I've got a real bad feeling about where this is going...  

## [Xmas' 19 - Tsugumi: End]: Harmony Resounding Through the Holy Night
The next day.

  
**Tsugumi:** Thank you for your patience, everyone. Before we begin today's training, please try this throat lozenge.  
**Mihono:** Uhh... It's got this weird color I can't really describe. Did you maybe make these yourself, Tsugumi-san...?  
**Tsugumi:** That's right. I took ingredients that were said to be good for the throat, ground them to a paste, and kneaded them into corn syrup.  
**Kofuki:** There's no way that's going in my mouth, alright\!  
**Mihono:** I-I practiced real hard by myself yesterday to bring my voice out, so I'll be fine without having to have one of those... Or something.  
**Tsugumi:** I see. I was fairly proud of how these turned out too...  
**Yui:** [sniff sniff]... Something sweet is in the air... And so I followed my nose, and it led me to a meetup of my sweet honeys\! My intuition's super on the mark\~\!  
**Tsugumi:** Yamashiro-san. You came at the perfect time. Would you like to have a snack?  
**Yui:** Can I\!\?  Ah\! Are these sweets you made yourself, Tsugumi-san\!\?  
**Tsugumi:** Yes. I tried creating special-made lozenges that were gentle on the throat, but the others said they didn't need them...  
**Yui:** In that case, I'll eat them up\! Om nom nom...  
**Yui:** Wahh-\! What's with this\!\? It's sweet and bitter and sour and burns and it's salty\!  
**Yui:** The outside is crunchy, but it melts on the inside, and afterwards there's this wave of a fluffy and crackling sensation\!  
**Kofuki:** What's any of that mean\!\? I can't even picture the taste\!  
**Mihono:** Yui, your face turned bright red; are you okay?  
**Yui:** Uwah----\! I can feel power gushing up in me, and I feel like shouting at the top of my lungs\~\!  
**Tsugumi:** Hmhm, the effects are already showing in such a short timeframe. It seems I can call this highly successful.  
**Yui:** Ahh\~\! I want to shout\! Shout my heart out\! AHHHH\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\!  
**Mihono:** Sh-She's so loud\! Yui's singing is making the windows rattle-\! Tsuguki-san's lozenges might actually be amazing\!  
**Yui:** Whoa; what's going on\! I can sing kobushi so well now it's funny\~\! Give me any enka song and I feel like I could sing it\! HAA\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\!		[Kobushi is a technique used in singing enka, where a single syllable is sung while moving between several different notes in succession]  
**Yui:** Ahh\~\! I want to sing out across the sea of Japan\! My body's itching to try it\~\! I can't take it anymore\! I'm on my way\!  
**Mihono:** And she's gone...  
**Tsugumi:** She sure is... Though, thanks to Yamashiro-san's sudden appearance, I was able to prove the potency of these lozenges. Now, you two, try some as well\!  
**Kofuki:** Wait, hold up\! I'll give you that they were effective as hell, but wasn't that deep singing voice of hers totally wrong for caroling?  
**Mihono:** Y-Yeah, that's right. We're singing carols here, not enka, so maybe practicing on our own efforts is the best way to go...  
**Tsugumi:** You think so? I managed to come up with something useful, so it would be a shame not to use them... But, if you both say so, then we can work at it that way.  
**Mihono/Kofuki:** Phew...  
December 25th.

  
**Mirja:** You performed well at yesterday's Christmas Eve party. Now I would like for you to maintain that effort and entertain this venue with your caroling.  
**Tsugumi:** Of course.  
**Mirja:** Hm? Ban Tsugumi, what's the matter with the two of them?  
**Tsugumi:** About that... It might be because the scale of the event is greater than they were expecting, but they seem to be nervous...  
**Kofuki:** I-I'm not nervous or anything, y'know. But you're nuts if you think the three of us are gonna liven up all these customers\!  
**Mihono:** Fukki's right here. Yesterday, all the toji waved lightsticks to pump up the mood, but today we've gotta sing without anything like that...  
**Mirja:** It's true that, in these unfamiliar circumstances, I can understand feeling nervous...  
**Tsugumi:** For the time being, why don't we let in some fresh air and try to freshen up.  
**Kofuki:** Oi\! It's gonna be freezing if you open a window\!  
**Mihono:** Yeah. I'm getting bad enough cold feet as it is...  
**Tsugumi:** Ah-- It's... Everyone, please look outside\!  
**Kofuki:** Whoa, it's snowing\! It's pure white out there\!  
**Mirja:** It's truly a fine white Christmas now.  
**Tsugumi:** By pure chance, we now have a fantastic backdrop for our performance. I'm sure we'll be able to carol well again today.  
**Mihono:** That's for sure. It'd be a waste to be feeling nervous singing in someplace this romantic looking\! Let's have as much fun as we can with it\!  
**Tsugumi:** Sure. Now then, let's go out. Our choir is taking the stage.

## [Misogi - Tsugumi: Start]: Chasing the Mysteries of Aradama
**Tsugumi:** [sippp, sippp... slurrrp...]  
**Tsugumi:** Mmm, this is no good.  
**Kofuki:** Oh, you finally realized how bad that stuff is? Even if it's nutritious, it tastes like crap.  
**Tsugumi:** Hm? What are you talking about? These packs are great tasting and perfectly nutritious; the complete portable meal.  
**Kofuki:** ...Huh? Wait, so what's no good then?  
**Tsugumi:** The fact that I've been ignoring a possibility up until now, is all.  
**Tsugumi:** I realized something. Haven't there been an awful lot of cases of aradama stealing things recently?  
**Tsugumi:** And, from a possibility in that... I've formed a hypothesis\!  
**Kofuki:** Ooh, some new way to run into tons of aradama-chan\!\?  
**Tsugumi:** Which is, is it possible that, when a subset of aradama steal objects from humans, they're wanting human attention?  
**Tsugumi:** Even when aradama steal objects, I don't believe they use them in any way.  
**Tsugumi:** What do you think, Shichinosato-san? About my "attention seeking aradama" theory\!  
**Kofuki:** You're looking all smug about it... but I really don't care.  
**Tsugumi:** Ehh, but don't you think it's extraordinarily bad that something this vital was overlooked until now-?  
**Kofuki:** I said I don't care\! Did you call me here just to tell me that...?  
**Tsugumi:** I'd like your help in collecting data on aradama, the same as usual-.  
**Tsugumi:** To test my earlier theory, I think we'll need a certain amount of concrete data as proof-- for example, what do they actually steal?  
**Kofuki:** So you're saying I'll get to play with loads of aradama-chan\!  
**Tsugumi:** Yes, though, the thing is... For this assignment, I'll need you to fight without bringing the aradama down right away, while limiting damage to the surroundings as much as possible.  
**Tsugumi:** Because the primary goal of this is observation, not defeating the aradama. Can you work around that?  
**Kofuki:** Hell no\! Why do I gotta sit around waiting in a fight?  
**Tsugumi:** If you hold yourself back a little, won't it feel 2-3 times more enjoyable when you do defeat the aradama?  
**Kofuki:** Yeah right. Call me up when you're done with this watch-'n-wait borefest.  
**Tsugumi:** Hmm, her reaction was within expectations. Though, collecting data on my own...  
**Tsugumi:** The best case would be to find someone who might have a different sort of interest in aradama than Shichinosato-san...  
**Tsugumi:** \!  
**Ellen:** So that's why you gave me a call then, Tsugumin\!  
**Tsugumi:** Yes, because of your personal views on aradama. I was sure you would be interested.  
**Ellen:** Yes\! This theory that aradama are stealing things because they want attention from people, it's very interesting\!  
**Ellen:** I think it sounds plausible too.  
**Tsugumi:** If my hypothesis is correct, and there are aradama with the nature to seek out humans of their own accord, it may even be possible for some to be tamed as pets.  
**Ellen:** That's right. It'd be wonderful if it could be more common for aradama to have relationships like Kaoru and Nene do.  
**Ellen:** I'll help you with this, Tsugumin. Do you have any ideas where there might be aradama looking for attention?  
**Tsugumi:** I've already taken care of researching that. So then, shall we go-?  
**Ellen:** Let's go\!  

## [Misogi - Tsugumi: End]: Trial and Error Towards a Dream
**Tsugumi:** From what a local farmer said, there are frequent cases of aradama stealing their crops.  
**Ellen:** There don't seem to be any attacks on people either. The theory's sounding more and more credible\!  
**Tsugumi:** Yes. It's considered impossible for aradama to grow accustomed to humans, but this shows promise, doesn't it-. I'm feeling inspired now-.  
**Ellen:** Take a look at the lettuce scattered around here\! It couldn't have happened naturally, and there's no signs of it being eaten\!  
**Aradama:** ......  
**Tsugumi:** This looks to be a bingo, fufu.  
**Tsugumi:** Though, you know, these aradama stealing crops and running off into the mountains are somewhat like monkeys, aren't they-.  
**Ellen:** Like monkeys, we might be able to get along with them\! Rather than a troupe of apes, it's a troupe of aradama\!  
**Tsugumi:** Gathering data here is a step towards that.  
**Tsugumi:** If we can find something resembling an aradama nest here, we can investigate whether they've collected man-made objects and so on... Though maybe I'm hoping for too much just yet.  
**Ellen:** We'll just have to pray we get lucky\~\.  
**Ellen:** Let's close the distance quick so they won't escape, and get some data while we're at it\!  
**Tsugumi:** Woo-\!  
**Tsugumi:** That's how excited I am now, to shout that-.  
**Ellen:** It looks like there's stuff besides stolen crops littered around.  
**Tsugumi:** From what we've confirmed from missions so far, aside from sometimes stealing food, they also steal a variety of things, from items that cover daily needs to objects made of processed metals.  
**Ellen:** We can't be sure the aradama are responsible for all of this, and I don't see any rhyme or reason behind it, but couldn't this be enough to say aradama are interested in humans, in a way?  
**Tsugumi:** I think it's plenty of basis to do a practical test of our hypothesis with that aradama.  
**Aradama:** ......  
**Tsugumi:** Alright, let's get closer. If the theory holds up, so long as we don't attack, it should be fine.  
**Ellen:** Come on, let's be friends\!  
**Tsugumi:** There's nothing to be afraid of-.  
**Ellen:** We can get along with Nene, so surely other aradama can do it too...  
**Aradama:** ......  
**Aradama:** KSHAAAAAAAAA\!  
**Tsugumi:** ...So this was no good.  
**Ellen:** That was even more shocking than getting attacked by aradama usually is...  
**Tsugumi:** If more of them are coming out, we can't give up hope just yet\!  
**Aradama:** GUGGGGIII...\!  
**Ellen:** That was exhausting...  
**Tsugumi:** They were all duds. I wonder if this hypothesis was incorrect... Either way, Kohagura-san. Thank you very much for joining me here.  
**Ellen:** I had fun too, so it's no problem\!  
**Tsugumi:** That's good then. Still, for what reason do aradama steal objects-? Causing that much disturbance will mean toji are sent to exorcise them...  
**Tsugumi:** Ah...\! It couldn't be that they're doing things to draw attention so that they can be exorcised, is it...?  
**Tsugumi:** Mmmghh...  
**Ellen:** You sure are dedicated to this, Tsugumin. What are you hoping to do by learning so much about aradama?  
**Tsugumi:** I want to find peaceful uses for aradama... Achieving some form of coexistence is my dream. It might be little more than a fantasy of mine now, but I'm serious about it-.  
**Ellen:** Oh\! Tsugumin\! Your dream is the same as mine\! We're like-minded comrades\!  
**Tsugumi:** Well now-. That's a pleasant surprise-.  
**Tsugumi:** I'd like to ask if we could share more information from now on, if that's alright with you, Kohagura-san.  
**Ellen:** Of course it is\!  
**Tsugumi:** Good, this should help me make progress in data gathering. Now then, on the way back, how about we discuss my idea from earlier-?  

## [Summer Uniform 20 - Tsugumi: Start]:
**Tsugumi:** We'll be... cleaning the pool?  
**Yomi:** Yes. President Takatsu ordered us "to clean it up."  
**Tsugumi:** Roger that-.  
**Tsugumi:** Though, it's going to be hard work if it's only the two of us. We should try reaching out to people we know.  
**Yomi:** Yes, please do.  
**Tsugumi:** Now, I said I would reach out to people, but I really don't know that many, do I-.  
**Tsugumi:** To start... Let's go with her.  
**Tsugumi:** Shichinosato-san.  
**Kofuki:** Huh? That's weird; you never come out here.  
**Tsugumi:** We'll be cleaning the pool after school tomorrow. There's no ifs, ands, or buts, so I'll see you there.  
**Tsugumi:** And please inform the rest of the investigation team for me, okay-.  
**Kofuki:** Twist my arm, why don't you\!  
**Tsugumi:** Next is...  
**Sayaka:** Tsugumi?  
**Tsugumi:** Ahh, good. You were here, Itomi-san.  
**Sayaka:** What do you need?  
**Tsugumi:** Actually, tomorrow, we'll be cleaning the pool. If you want, would you join us too?  
**Sayaka:** Cleaning the pool... Can I?  
**Tsugumi:** Of course you can.  
**Tsugumi:** Oh, and, after the cleaning is over, I think we'll be able to play around for a while.  
**Tsugumi:** Why not bring Yanase-san and the others along?  
**Sayaka:** Mm, okay. I'll ask them.  
**Tsugumi:** Right, that would be great.  
**Tsugumi:** I managed to ask the most noteable people to come, but, as for others...  
**Suu:** I don't have to do any more missions, or training, or the utsushi increasing program this week\! Hopefully every day gets to be like this\!  
**Tsugumi:** ......  
**Tsugumi:** Inami-san.  
**Suu:** GYAAAAAAAA\!\?  
**Suu:** ...Wait, Ban-san?  
**Tsugumi:** I overheard you speaking to yourself... Are you available tomorrow?  
**Suu:** Y-Yeah... I guess.  
**Tsugumi:** In that case, would you help us clean the pool? We'll be in trouble if we can't get more to help out.  
**Suu:** Cleaning the pool? If that's all, then...  
**Tsugumi:** I'm glad to hear it. Ah, by the way, the others joining us will be Shichinosato-san, Itomi-san, and Satsuki-san.  
**Suu:** Huh?  
**Tsugumi:** Then, I'll see you tomorrow.  
**Suu:** You didn't tell me they'd be there though\!\?  
**Tsugumi:** I spread the word for now, but... How many will actually be there?  
**Tsugumi:** I'll have to wait and see tomorrow.  

## [Summer Uniform 20 - Tsugumi: End]:
The day of the pool cleaning.

  
**Tsugumi:** Now then, let's begin cleaning the pool.  
**Akira:** Let's get to it, Tsugumi.  
**Akira:** Though, why's it just the two of us anyway? Yomi's the one who told me and she's not even here.  
**Tsugumi:** I was told she would be coming slightly later, along with the people I asked to come.  
**Tsugumi:** For the time being, you and I should proceed with the cleaning.  
**Akira:** Sure thing\!  
**Akira:** We'll get a lead on 'em before they show up\!  
**Tsugumi:** (How exactly do you get a lead on someone in cleaning a pool...?\)  
**Akira:** Hahahahahaha\! Bring on the hose\!  
**Akira:** I'm gonna keep raining down water, so keep up\!  
**Tsugumi:** Right. Then, I'll brush off the grime at the bottom.  
**Kanami:** Hey, they've already gotten started\!  
**Yui:** Ah, Boss's spraying water around\! Lucky\! I want to try it too\! I'll get Kiyoka-chan all wet\!  
**Kiyoka:** Why me\!\?  
**Mihono:** I'll help you out, Akira-san\!  
**Akira:** Sure, bring it on\! Let's get this started\!  
**Mai:** I guess we'll take care of the mopping?  
**Sayaka:** Mm.  
**Kaoru:** Do you actually need us here after all?  
**Ellen:** Don't be like that\! This looks fun, Kaoru\!  
**Ellen:** Inagooon\! We're helping you toooo\!  
**Suu:** S-Sorry I'm late... Ah\! Kanami-san\!  
**Kanami:** Oh, Suu-chan\! Did you already see this week's Marvelous-chan\!\?  
**Suu:** Of course I did\!  
**Akira:** Look at them all pouring in. Just how many people'd you invite?  
**Tsugumi:** I only asked three people to come...  
**Tsugumi:** (Shichinosato-san isn't here, is she. So she ran away.)  
**Akira:** You don't seem like it, but you're a real people person. Pretty good.  
**Tsugumi:** I'm not; let's just leave that aside and finish cleaning the pool.  
**Akira:** ...You're tough to get a handle on, y'know.

## [Mahou Shoujo - Tsugumi: Start]: Tsugumi-san Can Do Anything
**Announcement:** --An outbreak of aradama has been confirmed. Please follow instructions from officials and evacuate immediately.  
**Announcement:** I repeat--  
**Tsugumi:** Okay... Alright, I see. Thank you.  
**Tsugumi:** It sounds like the evacuation of the civilians has finished, everyone.  
**Nanoha:** Was there anybody who got hurt?  
**Tsugumi:** No, they all seem to be fine. Thank you for your concern though.  
**Fate:** That's good to hear.  
**Yume:** Alright then, I'm going with Fate-chan, so you can be with Nanoha-chan, Onee-san\!  
**Fate:** Ah\! Wait for me, Yume-san\!  
**Nanoha:** ...They ran off.  
**Tsugumi:** There's no helping it now. Since we've both been left behind, let's give it our best effort.  
**Nanoha:** Okay\! I'm glad to be with you, Tsugumi-san\!  
**Tsugumi:** Likewise.  
**Tsugumi:** Compared to Tsubakuro-san, I'm far less capable, so I'll be relying on your support, Takamachi-san-.  
**Nanoha:** Yume-san really is strong, isn't she.  
**Tsugumi:** That's a part of it, but... I did retire once.  
**Nanoha:** You... retired?  
**Tsugumi:** Yes. I returned to the action for a number of reasons, but my expertise is working behind the scenes.  
**Nanoha:** What do you do working behind the scenes?  
**Tsugumi:** I take care of research into aradama, or acting as operator for mock battles, among other things.  
**Nanoha:** You seem like you can do just about anything, Tsugumi-san.  
**Tsugumi:** ...  
**Tsugumi:** I wasn't expecting to hear such a blunt compliment just now.  
**Tsugumi:** I'm a little embarrassed.  
**Tsugumi:** Though... It isn't really all that impressive. I'm only doing the things I'm interested in doing.  
**Tsugumi:** Besides, from my perspective, you're far more impressive than I am, Takamachi-san.  
**Nanoha:** Ahaha, thank you very much.  
**Tsugumi:** Anyway, that's enough standing around chatting. Let's move out.  
**Tsugumi:** It wouldn't be good for us to be too leisurely and leave all the work to Tsubakuro-san and Harlaown-san.  
**Nanoha:** That's true\!  

## [Mahou Shoujo - Tsugumi: End]: Tsugumi-san is Strange
**Aradama:** GYAOOOOOOOOOOOOO\!  
**Nanoha:** Soul Shooter\!  
**Aradama:** ooo...  
**Tsugumi:** You're shooting them down the instant we encounter them? You're doing well.  
**Tsugumi:** There might not be a reason for me to be here like this-.  
**Nanoha:** It's not like that\! Haven't you cut down lots of them yourself, Tsugumi-san?  
**Tsugumi:** Thank you for having my back.  
**Tsugumi:** Though, I would personally rather leave the suppression to you, so that I can observe the aradama-.  
**Nanoha:** ...Huh?  
**Nanoha:** (Tsugumi-san, she's a little...)  
**Tsugumi:** Were you thinking that's strange?  
**Nanoha:** How could you tell\!\?  
**Tsugumi:** You're an honest person, Takamachi-san. Though, I get that a lot.  
**Tsugumi:** Leaving that aside, magic sure is incredible, isn't it? If I heard right, not everyone on the Earth you're from can use magic, can they?  
**Nanoha:** A while ago, I had a sort of encounter... I found magic, and Yuuno-kun, and Fate-chan...  
**Nanoha:** And I learned I had the strength to help save someone too.  
**Tsugumi:** (The way she's talking about it... Is Takamachi-san unconsciously fighting to save others?\)  
**Tsugumi:** (Then... that might make the people with her fairly anxious.)  
**Tsugumi:** ...It must be difficult.  
**Nanoha:** Eh? What's difficult?  
**Tsugumi:** Oh, just speaking to myself.  
**Tsugumi:** By the way, how do you defeat aradama with magic?  
**Nanoha:** Ah, right. That's because...  
**Nanoha:** What was that\!\?  
**Tsugumi:** I don't think that's the kind of sound that comes from fighting aradama... Did they run into trouble?  
**Tsugumi:** Though, considering those two, it doesn't seem likely...  
**Nanoha:** Let's go see\!\!  
**Yume:** Aha\! How about this\!  
**Fate:** Yume-san\! We're in the middle of a mission now\!  
**Yume:** We're making sure to beat the aradama, so it's fine\! Anyway... Let's do it some more, Fate-chan\!  
**Tsugumi:** ...Should we just pretend like we didn't see them?  
**Nanoha:** We can't do that\! Let's go in and stop them\!  
**Tsugumi:** If we have to. Let's go then.  
**Nanoha:** Right\!
