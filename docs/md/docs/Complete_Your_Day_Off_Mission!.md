Covers both fall events.

  

## 1: The Elite Guard's Time Off
**Maki:** Everyone, the mission schedule for this month is ready.  
**Yume:** Got it\! Are we doing anything interesting this time? Hurry up and let me see, Maki onee-san\!  
**Suzuka:** Last month we had fairly packed schedules; it was hard enough to find half a day to rest. How does it look this time?  
**Maki:** It's another pretty busy month, but it's arranged so each of us gets full days off at least.  
**Maki:** I'll send you all the data so you can go over it yourselves.  
**Yomi:** Thank you.  
**Suzuka:** It's true, there's just enough gaps between missions for some time to ourselves.  
**Yume:** So I get this day off, and this one too\~? Huh? Suzuka onee-san, don't we have the same day off?  
**Suzuka:** Would you look at that; that's quite the coincidence.  
**Yume:** Then, we should go play somewhere together\!  
**Suzuka:** I'd be glad to. It's rare for our time off to match up like this, so we should take advantage of the opportunity.  
**Yume:** I can't wait\~\! Maki onee-san, and Yomi onee-san too, if you have the same day off you should come with us\!  
**Maki:** Well, there's no way our schedules would line up that conveniently...  
**Maki:** That's strange, I have the same day off...  
**Yomi:** I do too...  
**Yume:** Hooray\~\! Now we can all go out together\! This is the best\! This is the best\!  
**Maki:** We never get the same day off like this, so what happened here...?  
**Suzuka:** Yukari-sama must be planning something.  
**Yume:** Don't think so hard about it, onee-sans\~\! We all got the day off together, so we should just have fun with it.  
**Yomi:** In any case, I'm going to confirm with Yukari-sama that this wasn't some mistake.  
**Yukari:** All of you have the same day off?  
**Maki:** Yes. Since we don't get much time off, I'd think all of us getting the same day would never happen.  
**Suzuka:** I was wondering if you were planning something by this, Yukari-sama...  
**Yukari:** I don't recall making any specific order here. Isn't it just that all of you happened to be without missions that day?  
**Maki:** It's true that all of us should have our work done for the time being that day...  
**Yukari:** Then that day is simply the most efficient time to give all of you a break.  
**Yume:** See, see\~? I said you were overthinking it, didn't I?  
**Yume:** Oh yeah\! Can you take that day off too, Yukari-sama? Then we can all have fun together\!  
**Yukari:** Unfortunately, I have a pile of duties steadily accumulating that need to be dealt with. You'll all have to enjoy yourselves without me.  
**Yume:** Well that sucks\~. But at least the four of us are together, right\!  
**Suzuka:** Yes, I'm glad we could clear up that it wasn't all some big mistake at least. Though...  
**Yomi:** Will it really be alright for all of us to be absent on the same day?  
**Suzuka:** We can have our time off whenever, so wouldn't it be best if we adjusted the schedule now?  
**Yume:** Ehh, but I thought we were all going to go hang out together...  
**Yukari:** Wait, there's no need for you to change your schedule. If you go making adjustments without good reason, it would throw other people's plans into disarray.  
**Yukari:** Since you have no work to do, you should enjoy your time off. So long as you fulfill the obligations you're given, you have nothing to worry about.  
**Suzuka:** Y... Yes ma'am.  
**Maki:** ...Yukari-sama might have said all that, but I'm still not sure about this.  
**Yume:** Yaaay\! Yukari-sama said it's okay, so we're all gonna go play together, right\!  
**Suzuka:** Well, we did get approval from Yukari-sama... And it would be nice for all the elite guard to spend time together.  
**Maki:** You're right, you never know if we'll see another chance like this.  
**Yume:** Alright-\! So let's think of where we're going\!  
**Yomi:** ...  

## 2: You Have the Day Off?
On the day everyone had off--

  
**Yume:** Maki onee-san, Suzuka onee-san\! They're starting the line for the roller coaster\! We should get up in front.  
**Suzuka:** Don't run like that, Yume. It's dangerous.  
**Yume:** I'll be fine-\! Who do you think I am\!  
**Maki:** There sure are a lot of people who came to the amusement park today, aren't there?  
**Suzuka:** I know, it's already so crowded. If only Yomi had come along with us...  
**Yomi:** ......  
**Yukari:** Hm? Yomi, don't you have the day off?  
**Yomi:** Yukari-sama. Good work. Is something wrong?  
**Yukari:** To begin with, Yomi, I'm talking about you. What are you doing here?  
**Yomi:** Yes, I was doing my usual duties, reviewing paperwork that needs to be settled...  
**Yukari:** I'd heard Maki and the others went to an amusement park. You didn't go with them?  
**Yomi:** They did invite me, but I remembered I still had paperwork to take care of.  
**Yomi:** Approved, unapproved... Approved...  
**Yukari:** That paperwork, it's not something that needed doing right now, was it?  
**Yomi:** No...  
**Yukari:** Then, on your day off, when your comrades invited you out, why would you refuse them and force yourself back to work?  
**Yomi:** That's because...  
**Yomi:** Yukari-sama. I appreciate your consideration for allowing all of us to take the day off at once... However, I can't bring myself to leave the Origami household without any members of the elite guard.  
**Yukari:** Is that something you discussed with the others before deciding?  
**Yomi:** No... They looked so happy planning where to go on their day off that I couldn't bring it up, so I told them I remembered I still had work left to do.  
**Yukari:** I see. Yomi, your devotion to your duties is one of your admirable qualities, however...  
**Yukari:** How about this. I have an assignment for someone as dedicated as you that needs to be taken care of today.  
**Yomi:** Understood, I'll do whatever you ask of me.  
**Yukari:** In that case, take the day off at once.  
**Yomi:** Eh...?  
**Yukari:** Making use of the breaks in your work to rest is an invaluable part of self-management. Your mission today is to enjoy your day off to the fullest.  
**Yomi:** But, Yukari-sama...  
**Yukari:** Put away those papers at once, and begin your mission. That's all I have to say.  
**Yomi:** Yukari-sama\! ...She's gone.  
**Yomi:** Yukari-sama gave me this mission, so I have to carry it out, but how...?  

## 3: Yomi's Day Off
**Yomi:** Enjoy my day off to the fullest... That's what Yukari-sama told me, but what does that mean, and where could I do it...?  
**Yomi:** ...  
**Yomi:** Ah, that's right. If I join Shidou-san and the others, who should still be at the amusement park, Yukari-sama must be able to accept that.  
**Yomi:** First, to see if joining them is still a possibility. I'll call Shidou-san.  
**Yomi:** She won't pick up... In that case, someone else...  
**Yume:** Hey heyyy\~\! Yomi onee-san? It's Yume\!  
**Yomi:** Tsubakuro-san, I wanted to talk to Shidou-san...  
**Yume:** Maki onee-san went to go buy some ice cream. Get this, I'm about to ride a roller coaster with Maki onee-san and Suzuka onee-san\!  
**Yomi:** I'm glad you're having a good time. When Shidou-san gets back, could you please tell her to call...  
**Yume:** Ah, she's back\! I'll put her on\!  
**Maki:** Hello, Yomi? Sorry I couldn't get back to you. This place has been packed all morning. I wish you could've been here with us.  
**Maki:** Anyway, what's the matter? Did something come up with work?  
**Yomi:** No, it's not like that...  
**Public Announcement:** Sorry to report... ber of visitors... restricting entry... der of the day...  
**Maki:** Oh, huh...  
**Yomi:** What was that?  
**Maki:** It's nothing. I was just thinking it was so crowded today, when they announced they're restricting entry from now on.  
**Yomi:** They're... Restricting entry?  
**Maki:** Ah, I think Suzuka has something she wants to ask you. I'm putting her on.  
**Suzuka:** Hello, it's me. Yomi, which do you prefer, chocolates or cookies?  
**Yomi:** I don't mind either of them...  
**Suzuka:** When you answer like that, it only makes this decision harder... The souvenir shop here has all sorts of delicious looking sweets.  
**Suzuka:** It's a shame you aren't with us, Yomi. We could have had fun picking them out together.  
**Suzuka:** Oh, it's our turn to get on the ride, so I'll have to hang up now. We'll buy you souvenirs on our way back, so do your best at work, Yomi.  
**Yomi:** ......If they're restricting entry, I won't be able to join them at the amusement park, will I...  
**Yomi:** In that case, where could I go to enjoy my day off to the fullest...?  
**Yomi:** Now that I think about it, I was never taught how to spend free time... What do I do...  
**Yomi:** If I look into it at the library, I might be able to find a book that can help.  
**Yomi:** Ways to spend free time... Ways to spend free time...  
**Passing Toji A:** Hey, next time we get a day off, wanna stop by Harajuku?  
**Passing Toji B:** Sounds good. Harajuku it is\~\!  
**Yomi:** (I see, Harajuku...? I remember other toji often talking about having fun during their time off there.)  
**Yomi:** (If I go to Harajuku, I might find a way to enjoy my day off to its fullest. I should go now, for the sake of my mission...)  
**Yomi:** Sigh, I've finally arrived. This is my first time coming here outside of suppressing aradama. It's crowded during normal hours.  
**Yomi:** Now that I'm here to enjoy Harajuku on my day off... What exactly should I be doing...?  
**Yui:** Heyy, good looking\~\! Is something bothering you? Why don't I show you a good time\~\!  
**Yomi:** A good time? Are you talking to me?  
**Yui:** Ah-\! You're from the elite guard... Satsuki Yomi-san\!  
**Yui:** My bad\! You know me, as soon as I see some cute girl I can't help myself. I had no idea you were one of the elite guard...  
**Yui:** I'm really sorry about this\! Anyway, I'll leave you alone now...  
**Yomi:** Please wait. Weren't you going to show me a good time?  
**Yui:** Eh?  
**Yomi:** In that case, by all means, let me accompany you.  
**Yui:** EHHHH-------------\!\!\!\!\!  

## 4: Yui's Day Off Lessons
**Yomi:** That is, will you teach me the fundamentals of "a good time in Harajuku"?  
**Yui:** You should loosen up first, Satsuki-san\!  
**Yomi:** I'm sorry. I don't have a good understanding of what it means to spend free time.  
**Yomi:** If you don't mind, I want to join you on my day off and have you teach me how to enjoy Harajuku. Would that be acceptable?  
**Yui:** Hnnng, I couldn't be happier, getting a request like that\! Of course I'm okay with it\! It's my lucky day, taking Satsuki-san on a date around Harajuku\~\!  
**Yui:** I'll give you the full tour, so you can see exactly how I get the most out of Harajuku\~\!  
**Yomi:** I'll be in your care. What should we be doing first...?  
**Yui:** When it comes to Harajuku, the thing that stands out most is crepes\!  
**Yomi:** I've heard about those before...  
**Yui:** And observing cute girls eating them\!  
**Yomi:** Observing...? Is that right...  
**Yui:** Of course\! We shouldn't waste any more time\! Let's head to where they're selling some\~\!  
**Yui:** Okay, now we'll begin our lookout in front of that crepe stand\!  
**Yomi:** Understood. When it comes to observing girls eating crepes, what should I be looking for specifically...  
**Yui:** Just trust in your instincts, and when you see a girl who grabs your attention, look verrry closely at her behavior and expressions\!  
**Yomi:** My instincts... I see.  
**Yui:** Ah-, that one's so cute\! No, wait\! Her friend next to her's good looking too\~. I don't believe it, are they twins\~? That's adorable\~\!  
**Yomi:** Stare...  
**Yui:** So what do you think, Satsuki-san? Can't get enough of those glittering "Which crepe should I eat" eyes, can you\~?  
**Yui:** Just seeing that is enough to keep me coming back to Harajuku\!  
**Yomi:** I see, their eyes were glittering? Understood, I'll focus on that point from now on. Is there anywhere else I should pay attention to...  
**Yui:** Let's see\~, for example... Like if you see a cool looking girl suddenly start passionately explaining the appeal of chocolate mint, while she licks away at it\!  
**Yui:** Getting to see that kind of gap in attitude is the real thrill of coming to a crepe stand\!  
**Yomi:** The enjoyment of witnessing the moment schoolgirls categorize their tastes, contradicting your expectations... Am I understanding it?  
**Yui:** Mmm\~, you don't have to make it sound so complicated, or even really understand it. Just so long as it makes you feel good, it's all alright\!  
**Yomi:** To be honest, I can't seem to find the same excitement in this as you can, Yamashiro-san. But in order to make a meaningful report to Yukari-sama, I'll try my best.  
**Yui:** Ahaha, you're so weird, Satsuki-san\! I know\! To celebrate us meeting up today, how about I buy you a crepe?  
**Yui:** Sorry that took a minute. Here you go\! I only have pocket change on me, so I had to buy the cheapest cream crepe though.  
**Yomi:** Thank you for your consideration.  
**Yomi:** Chew, chew... This is simple, but very delicious.  
**Yui:** That's great\~. I feel like I'm dreaming, getting to see Satsuki-san eating up close like this\! Ahhh\~ I'm being healed\~.  
**Yui:** This is what time off is all about\! Thanks to you, I had the best vacation. Now I'm refreshed and ready to give my all starting tomorrow\!  
**Yomi:** (Yamashiro-san seems to have fully enjoyed her day off, but is this actually what Yukari-sama asked me to do...?)  

## 5: Help Arrives\!
**Yui:** Satsuki-san, it's time for the next attraction: observing the girls standing in line at the bubble tea stand\! Let's go\!  
**Yomi:** Understood.  
**Yui:** You know, with the streets this packed, there's cuties every where you turn. Fun huh\~.  
**Yomi:** (I'm not sure if the way Yamashiro-san enjoys her day off will satisfy what Yukari-sama asked of me...)  
**Yui:** Wait-\! Those two cute girls that were together just now...  
**Yomi:** Ah, Yamashiro-san, please don't leave me behind.  
**Yui:** Sayaka-chaaan\! Mai-chaaaan\!  
**Sayaka:** Yui.  
**Mai:** Fancy running into you here.  
**Yui:** I know, it's like I won the lottery today\~\! I'm about to start tearing up\! So, so? What're you two doing in Harajuku?  
**Mai:** Sayaka-chan and I had the day off, so we thought we'd go shopping here.  
**Sayaka:** We drank bubble tea too.  
**Yui:** Nnn\~ I can't get enough of it\~ This "girls day out" feeling\! I can't believe I also managed to run into you two today\~.  
**Sayaka:** Also...?  
**Yomi:** Good, I caught up with you. Yamashiro-san, why did you run away?  
**Sayaka:** Satsuki Yomi...  
**Yomi:** Yanase-san and Itomi-san.  
**Mai:** You two are an unusual pair. What were you up to?  
**Yomi:** Today, I was having Yamashiro-san teach me meaningful ways to spend my day off.  
**Sayaka:** Teaching you how to spend your day off...?  
**Yui:** Satsuki-san said she wanted to know how to have fun in her free time, so I'm coaching her in my way of enjoying Harajuku to the fullest\~.  
**Mai:** Coaching? What did you teach her? I want to know too.  
**Yui:** Stuff like sitting in front of a crepe stand and observing the cute girls going by\!  
**Sayaka:** Observing...?  
**Yomi:** I learned to watch a person's eyes as they make purchases. And that it's essential to measure the gap in deviation between a person's style and their tastes.  
**Yui:** There's no better way to spend your day off than joining a cute girl to watch cute girls, don't you think\~?  
**Mai:** I-I guess that's one way to spend it...  
**Sayaka:** Satsuki Yomi, did you have fun doing that?  
**Yomi:** I'm diligently trying to. But I'm still unfamiliar with spending time off.  
**Sayaka:** I don't think... That's how people normally spend their day off.  
**Yomi:** That isn't normal?  
**Yui:** Huhhhh? You're kidding? I do this stuff for fun practically every day though...  
**Yomi:** If what Yamashiro-san does in her free time isn't normal, then what does a normal day off consist of...?  
**Yui:** Satsuki-san, I'm sorry\! I was having the best time with you, but I think I might've not really been all that helpful?  
**Yomi:** ...  
**Mai:** Um, if you don't mind, why don't the four of us enjoy ourselves together?  
**Yomi:** Could I join you?  
**Sayaka:** If Mai says so, we'll do it.  
**Yui:** Eh, no way-\! Somebody pinch me\! I'm surrounded by cute girls\! Forget having a good day off, I must be dreaming\!  

## 6: Another Helper
**Yomi:** Yanase-san, and Itomi-san too, I'll be counting on your guidance.  
**Sayaka:** ...  
**Mai:** To start with, why don't we wander about and look at the western clothes on sale?  
**Mai:** This dress is cute, isn't it?  
**Yui:** I know, right\! I think it'd look good on Satsuki-san\! Here, hold it up to yourself for a second\!  
**Yomi:** ...  
**Sayaka:** Satsuki Yomi, do you not like it?  
**Yomi:** The materials seem to lack durability, and the shape of the sleeves would get in the way of fighting.  
**Mai:** Ah, y-you're right... I didn't think of it, from that perspective.  
**Mai:** Th-Then why don't we look in that general store over there? They sell some cute and a little strange mascot accessories. It's a popular place.  
**Yui:** Wow, look at this\! This doll's so uglycute\~\! (dasakawa)  
**Yomi:** Aradama\!\?  
**Yui:** N-No\! That's not what I said-\! Not aradama, da-sa-ka-wa\!  
**Yomi:** Forgive me. To me, it sounded like you said something else.  
**Mai:** I guess that's proof that your mind is always ready for action. That's the elite guard for you...  
**Yomi:** ...  
**Mai:** What's the matter, you're checking your phone. Is someone trying to get in touch with you?  
**Yomi:** No, it's nothing important.  
**Yui:** In that case, let's go to the next store\! Forget about your phone\!  
**Yomi:** You're right. Let's go.  
**Yomi:** ......  
**Sayaka:** Satsuki Yomi, you checked your phone again.  
**Yomi:** I feel like I might receive an urgent message...  
**Yomi:** I'm sorry, it's my mission to enjoy my day off to its fullest, but aradama suppression is weighing on the back of my mind...  
**Mai:** Maybe, because things are so busy here in the city, it's hard for you to feel at ease?  
**Yomi:** What do you mean?  
**Mai:** Everyone has different places they feel like they can relax in. In your case, Satsuki-san, if we move somewhere that's more rich with nature, you'll have a better day off, I think.  
**Yomi:** I see, a place with more nature? It's true that Harajuku is so crowded it's difficult for me to calm down. I agree that we should move somewhere quieter.  
**Yui:** In that case, where would be good\~? When I think of cute girls in the great outdoors, it's gotta be the beach\!  
**Sayaka:** Yui, it's November...  
**Yui:** Shoot. But I wanted to see all of you in swimsuits\~.  
**Kofuki:** Huh? What're you guys doing all hanging out here?  
**Yui:** Whoa\! Even Kofuki-san's here now\! That's it\! You should come mess around with us, Kofuki-san\!  
**Kofuki:** Mess around? I just got done doing that with some aradama-chan, so I'm headed back to Kamakura.  
**Yui:** Ehhh, it's only noon. What's the harm in hanging out with us for a while\~?  
**Kofuki:** The harm's that I hate how packed the stations get at night. And the leaves are in their fall colors, so Kamakura gets a ton of sightseers this time of season.  
**Mai:** Fall colors\! That could do the trick. Why don't we all visit Kamakura and go leaf viewing?  
**Sayaka:** That could be good... I agree with Mai.  
**Yui:** Good looking girls under the red leaves\! That's the kind of scenery you can't see any other time of year. I'm all for this plan\~\! What about you, Satsuki-san? What do you want to do?  
**Yomi:** The Origami estate is in Kamakura, so I knew about the leaves in their fall colors. But the idea of visiting there with the intention of sightseeing is very interesting to me.  
**Mai:** If we leave now, the stations shouldn't be crowded. Shichinosato-san, if it's not too much of a bother, could you show us some of the best spots to see the leaves?  
**Kofuki:** Huhh? Why do I have to...  
**Sayaka:** Kofuki. Please.  
**Kofuki:** ...Ughhhh... Fine, have it your way. I'll show you around.  
**Kofuki:** But let me say this, I'm not going anywhere near the usual tourist traps. I find some good places every now and then when I'm on missions, so that's all I'll show you.  

## 7: First Fall Leaf Viewing
**Mai:** Wow, it's beautiful\!  
**Sayaka:** Amazing... The trees are all red.  
**Yui:** Ooh\~, that's crazy\! It's as pretty as a painting\! You know your stuff, Kofuki-san\!  
**Kofuki:** Right? If I say it's good, it's good. What do you think, Yomi-senpai?  
**Yomi:** ..................  
**Kofuki:** O-Oi, are you in there? Yomi-senpai?  
**Yomi:** Ah-, excuse me\! I was overwhelmed by the sight of all the leaves.  
**Yomi:** This must have always been here in Kamakura, but this is the first time I've felt aware of it...  
**Yui:** Gahhh\~, I missed it, Satsuki-san losing herself in the fall colors\! I'll get my camera ready, so please do it again\!  
**Yomi:** ...Even if you ask me to, it's difficult to repeat it now.  
**Yui:** In front of a backdrop of autumn leavings, the seductive look of a slightly lost Satsuki-san\! This works too\~\! A rare shot that can only be found this time of year\!  
**Yui:** Okay, okay\~, it's your turn now, Mai-chan, Sayaka-chan\! Try gathering up the leaves on the ground, and then whooshing them all up in the air\~\!  
**Mai:** Eh? Ummm\~... Like, this?  
**Sayaka:** The leaves falling down... They're pretty.  
**Yomi:** The ground and the air are filled with such pretty colors. It's beautiful.  
**Yui:** Mmmm\~, that's good, that's good\~\! Beautiful leaves and beautiful girls\! Kofuki-san, you need to get in here too\~\!  
**Kofuki:** No thanks, I'm fine over here\!  
**Kofuki:** But you know, if you guys are gonna be this happy about it, I guess it was worth getting dragged along.  
**Kofuki:** Oh yeah, Yomi-senpai, you're from Renpu too, aren't you? Do you know any other good spots?  
**Yomi:** That's right... There was a place I heard about during my time as a student. It should be around here.  
**Yui:** Then, to thank us, you should take us there\!  
**Mai:** I don't think you should tell others to do things as thanks...  
**Yomi:** Understood. I'll think back and try to lead you there.  
**Yomi:** It should be this place.  
**Mai:** Wow, it's beautiful here too.  
**Kofuki:** Well what do you know, even Yomi-senpai has some good ideas\!  
**Yomi:** I'm glad to hear everyone likes it.  
**Yomi:** Please excuse me...  
**Sayaka:** Satsuki Yomi's stomach growls too.  
**Yomi:** I'm sorry. Thinking back on it, the only thing I've eaten today was a crepe.  
**Mai:** If I'd known we could have had a picnic together, I would have made some boxed lunches.  
**Yomi:** If I'd known this would happen, I would have packed rice balls...  
**Yui:** Well I thought something like this might happen\! So while we were passing the shops just now, I bought some tasty looking stuff\!  
**Kofuki:** Hey, nice thinking\!  
**Sayaka:** Croquettes, senbei, dango. They all look tasty... Satsuki Yomi, which one do you want?  
**Yomi:** In that case, I'll take a croquette.  
**Kofuki:** I want a croquette too\! The ones the shops sell here are nice and cold. You've got a good eye, Yui.  
**Yui:** Yay\~\! I got complimented.  
**Sayaka:** Chew, chew... This dango is tasty. Mai, let me try your croquette.  
**Mai:** Here, you can have half. Can I try your dango too?  
**Mai:** Ahh\~, it's so good. Compared to eating crepes in Harajuku, this is wonderful in its own way.  
**Yomi:** Yes. Eating here, surrounded by beautiful scenery, adds a different flavor than normal.  
**Yomi:** I've visited this area many times while on missions, but now that I'm here on my day off, I'm finding things that make it feel like an entirely different place.  
**Sayaka:** Satsuki Yomi, right now... You're enjoying your time off.  
**Yomi:** ...This is what it means to enjoy your time off... I see, I think I finally understand it.  
**Yomi:** Everyone, thank you for joining me today.  

## 8: Day Off Report
The day after their time off--

  
**Maki:** Yukari-sama, thank you for giving us our day off yesterday.  
**Yukari:** Were all of you able to enjoy yourselves?  
**Maki:** Yes. We met at 8:00 am outside the entrance to the Origami estate. Afterward, the three of us moved as a group to...  
**Suzuka:** Maki-san, you aren't delivering an aradama suppression report. Why don't we hand them their souvenirs before we tell them about our trip?  
**Suzuka:** For Yukari-sama, we picked out chocolate in the shape of the amusement park mascot. And for Yomi, these cookies.  
**Yomi:** Thank you.  
**Yume:** Yomi onee-san, let me have some of those later.  
**Maki:** Didn't you buy cookies for yourself, Yume?  
**Yume:** They were too good, so I already ate them all\! Anyway, let's talk about our trip\~. What was your favorite part of the park?  
**Suzuka:** In my case, I won't forget the go kart competition we had.  
**Yume:** Maki onee-san was stepping on the gas so hard it sounded like her kart was going to break.  
**Maki:** Y-Yume\! You didn't have to tell them that\!  
**Suzuka:** It was like watching a little kid, the way you kept trying to go faster.  
**Maki:** Not you too, Suzuka...  
**Yume:** But I still won in the end. Next time, I wanna race Yukari-sama and Yomi onee-san too\!  
**Yukari:** Good, I'm glad to hear you enjoyed yourselves.  
**Yukari:** How did you spend your time, Yomi? I heard you didn't go to the amusement park.  
**Yomi:** Yes. I completed my mission to enjoy my day off to the fullest without incident, and have returned to make my report.  
**Yomi:** The details of my report are written in this document, which you can read through if you wish.  
**Maki:** Mission?  
**Suzuka:** Report...?  
**Yukari:** ...I see. You recorded not just the beauty of the scenery, but the flavor of the dango. This is a fine report.  
**Yomi:** Does this satisfy your conditions for my assignment?  
**Yukari:** Yes. Admiring the changing of the seasons through observing the fall leaves, and sampling the regional delicacies. I believe you fully enjoyed your day off.  
**Yume:** Ehh, you went to see the fall leaves? What the heck, that's no fair that only Yomi onee-san got to go\! You should've let me go with you\~.  
**Maki:** Yomi, do you mind if we read through that report too?  
**Yomi:** No, go ahead.  
**Suzuka:** Hmm. So this is what you meant by your mission. It sounds like it was a lovely time, going leaf viewing.  
**Maki:** Mmhm. Reading over this, it's making me wish we had gone to see it too.  
**Suzuka:** In that case, if we're lucky enough to get the same day off again, why don't we all go to see the fall colors?  
**Maki:** That sounds like a plan. Another coincidence like this could always come up, even it's unlikely.  
**Yume:** When that happens, Yomi onee-san, you have to show us all the prettiest places\!  
**Yomi:** I will. We can all go together next time.
