**\?\?\?:** Kgh\.\.\. You would burn me as well\.\.\.\? Even so\.\.\.  
**\?\?\?:** Ugh\.\.\. Ggh\.\.\.

## 6: In the Flames (2\)
**\?\?\?:** (Let's kill\?\)  
**\?\?\?:** (Let's kill all of them who try to stop us\?\)  
**\?\?\?:** (I bet it'll feel really good\.\)  
**Mihono:** I\.\.\. want to kill them\.\.\.  
**\?\?\?:** (Yeah\.\)  
**\?\?\?:** (Let's kill a lot\.\)  
**\?\?\?:** (Who first\? Who's the most special to you\?\)  
**Mihono:** Chii-nee\.\.\.  
**\?\?\?:** (Then, let's kill that person first\.\)  
**Mihono:** Kill Chii-nee\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** (Why would I\.\.\. kill Chii-nee\.\.\.\?\)  
**\?\?\?:** (Because you want to break her\.\)  
**Mihono:** That's right\.\.\. I want to break Chii-nee\.\.\.  
**\?\?\?:** Your heart is ablaze\.  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.\?  
**\?\?\?:** Who is this \"Chii-nee\"\?  
**Mihono:** She the most special to me\.\.\. so I'll kill her\.\.\.  
**\?\?\?:** When a person is killed, they are dead\.  
**Mihono:** (\.\.\.\? Well that's\.\.\. obvious\.\.\.\)  
**\?\?\?:** Do you wish for her to be dead\?  
**Mihono:** I don't\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** (I don't want her to die\.\.\. Wait\? Then, why am I\.\.\.\?\)  
**\?\?\?:** For how long will you continue to burn, Atago\?  
**Mihono:** Burn\.\.\.\?  
**Mihono:** (\.\.\.Ah\.\)  
**\?\?\?:** (Let's kill her\.\)  
**Mihono:** That's right\.\.\. I was\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** (This voice made me start going crazy\.\)  
**\?\?\?:** (Let's kill her\.\)  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.I'm not killing her\. I'm not\.\.\. killing anybody\.  
**Mihono:** Because I want to keep being a toji\!  
**Mihono:** Nn\.\.\.  
**\?\?\?:** Have you awakened\?  
**Mihono:** Uhhh\.\.\. Who're you\? I'm pretty sure I was\.\.\. Kanayamahime got to me\.\.\. and then, I\.\.\.\!  
**\?\?\?:** gh\!\!  
**Mihono:** Uwah\!\?  
**\?\?\?:** Please be calm, Atago\. Kagutsuchi would take advantage of your disordered heart\.  
**Mihono:** Kagutsuchi\.\.\.\? Isn't that Kanayamahime\.\.\.\?  
**Kanayamahime:** I am Kanayamahime\. And\.\.\. Kagutsuchi is my true form\.  
**Mihono:** Ehh\!\?  
**Kanayamahime:** Please do not let Kagutsuchi near\. Kagutsuchi is destruction itself\.  
**Kanayamahime:** It would destroy even you, Atago\.  
**Mihono:** W-Wait, hang on a minute\!  
**Mihono:** When you keep saying Atago, you mean me\?  
**Kanayamahime:** I do\.  
**Mihono:** Oh yeah\.\.\. When you were sealed, we were the Atagos\.  
**Mihono:** It's Mihono\. I'm Asakura Mihono\.  
**Kanayamahime:** Very well, Mihono\.  
**Mihono:** (It's weird\.\.\. I can't see Kanayamahime as my enemy\. Because she saved me\? Because she's protecting me\?\)  
**Kanayamahime:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\?  
**Mihono:** It's like I was dreaming\.\.\. It kept telling me, to destroy\.\.\. to kill\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** So that's\.\.\. Kagutsuchi\?  
**Kanayamahime:** It is\.  
**Mihono:** That's\.\.\. That's not something we can let out in the world\. We have to exorcise it somehow\.\.\.  
**Kanayamahime:** Very well\.  
**Kanayamahime:** Let us regain your body\. Kagutsuchi's main body is not here\.  
**Mihono:** But, how am I supposed to get my body back\.\.\.\? Can you do it for me, Kanayamahime\?  
**Mihono:** Ow-- It's hot\!\?  
**Kanayamahime:** This is what came of seeking power\.  
**Mihono:** Seeking power\.\.\.\?  
**Mihono:** I don't get what you mean\. Can you explain more\?  
**Kanayamahime:** Please defeat Kagutsuchi by your own strength\. I cannot give you mine\.  

## 7: Do We Trust Her\? Or Not\?
**Mihono:** Do you hear me\?  
**Chie:** Mihono-chan\!\?  
**Mihono:** I am not\.  
**Kanami:** Then, Kanayamahime\.\.\.\?  
**Mihono:** Yes, I am that which you call Kanayamahime\.  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.Would that mean, things are going as expected\?  
**Yui:** If she's talking, then\.\.\. I guess so\?  
**Hiyori:** Kanami\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** Yeah\.\.\. This is like with Yukari-sama\.  
**Mihono:** Mihono is fighting\. Please, save Mihono\.  
**Everyone:** Eh\!\?  
**Mai:** D-Do we trust her\.\.\.\?  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.  
**Nene:** Ne\! Nene\!\! Nenenene\!  
**Kaoru:** Get away from her, Nene\! That's not Mihono\.\.\.\!  
**Nene:** Nee\!  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.  
**Nene:** Nee\?  
**Mihono:** Yes\.  
**Ellen:** They're talking\.\.\. I wonder what they're saying\?  
**Kaoru:** Like I'd know\.  
**Kaoru:** But\.\.\. that probably means it's okay to trust her\.  
**Nene:** Nenee\!  
**Nene:** Ne\.  
**Mihono:** Thank you for your aid\.  
**Nene:** Nee\~\!  
**Sayaka:** What should we do\?  
**Mihono:** What you have done will not be enough\. Please weaken her even further\.  
**Kofuki:** Wait, that's it\!\?  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Akira:** So she says what she wants and she's gone again\.  
**Akira:** Still, this isn't enough\? No more playing touch and go then\. If it kills her, you asked for it\!\!  
**Kanami:** I'll go all out\.\.\. If that's what'll save Mihono-chan\!  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\!  
**Mirja:** Aradama\!\? Did they come in response to Kanayamahime\!\?  
**Mai:** \.\.\.What should we do\?  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** Investigation team\! Suppress the aradama\! We can handle this\!  
**Kofuki:** Who do you think you're talking to\? No shit I'll\.\.\.  
**Chie:** --\!\!  
**Kofuki:** [whistle\~\]  
**Chie:** I'm not letting them stop everyone now\.  
**Chie:** COME ON\!\!
