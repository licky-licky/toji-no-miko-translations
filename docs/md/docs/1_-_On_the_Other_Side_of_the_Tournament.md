## 1: What It Means to Carry an Okatana (1\)
The next day\.\.\. The day of the tournament\.

  
In the streets of Kamakura, outside the tournament venue set on the Origami family estate\.\.\.

  
**Friend B:** Kamakura\! This place is packed\!  
**Mihono:** Well, maybe if you're comparing it to our hometown\. At least compare it to Nagoya or something\.\.\.  
**Friend B:** Really\? Well, there's a ton of people here\!  
**Friend A:** You two\.\.\. By the way, Mihono, do you have to go somewhere else in the venue\? Since you're a substitute, they probably want you ready at any time\.  
**Mihono:** Nah, I can stay with you\. In the case that Kanami or Yanase-san can't compete, I can be waiting in the audience\.  
**Friend B:** I see\.\.\. Oh\! I spotted girls from another school\! Could that be Kanami's opponent\?  
**Kofuki:** Hah\? What do ya think you're lookin' at\?  
**Friend B:** (\.\.\.sneak sneak\)  
**Friend B:** Mihono, I'm leaving this to you\!  
**Mihono:** (Eh\!\?\)  
**Mihono:** Ah, umm, sorry, about my friend\. Those uniforms, you're from Renpu, aren't you\? Since you're carrying okatana, does that make you their representatives\?  
**Kofuki:** Nope\. This girl here's the representative\. I'm just her escort\.\.\.\.\.\. Huh\!\?  
*sounds of crashing and running*

  

## [There's aradama\!]

## [I'll call the police\.\.\.]

## [Get out of here first, you idiot\!]
**Kofuki:** Tch\! What's going on here\!\? Kamakura's right in the Origami family's lap\.\.\. Hell, their house is right over there\! Those are some dumbass aradama\!  
**Sayaka:** \.\.\.You can badmouth them after\. We have to stop them\.  
**Kofuki:** You don't have to tell me\! So long as I get to kill some aradama, I'll be there\!  
**Friend B:** Let's go, Mihono\! We have to evacuate\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** You two get out of here\! I'll help out those Renpu girls\! It's a toji's duty to deal with aradama, after all\!  
**Friend A:** T-Then we can help too\!  
**Mihono:** No way\! Without your okatana, you can't use utsushi\. You could really get hurt\!  
**Mihono:** I'm the only one with an okatana here, so I'll deal with it\! Just\.\.\. Leave this to me\!  

## 2: What It Means to Carry an Okatana (2\)
**Mihono:** They're small, but there's so many\.\.\. We haven't even cleared half of them, where did they\.\.\.  
**Kofuki:** Haha\! Not bad, Minoseki\! What's your name\?  
**Mihono:** Eh\? Name\? I must not have said it before\. I'm a 2nd year at Minoseki\.\.\. Asakura Mihono\!  
**Kofuki:** My name's Shichinosato Kofuki, 3rd year in Renpu's middle school\. Over there's Itomi Sayaka, same group, 1st year\!  
**Sayaka:** \.\.\.I'm going on ahead\.  
**Mihono:** O-Okay\.\.\. She's gone\!\?  
**Kofuki:** \.\.\.Yeah, well, she's speedy like that\. And that just means we get all the aradama still here to ourselves\! \.\.\.So first, let me make one thing clear\.  
**Kofuki:** If you take any of my aradama, my fun, any of the one's I'm claiming\.\.\. You're gonna pay for it\.  
**Mihono:** Huh\? What\? Are you joking, or is this some kind of game to you\.\.\.  
**Kofuki:** What's it matter\! Anyway, I'm on the hunt\.\.\.\! Kuku\.\.\. I love you, aradama-chan\!  

## 3: The Gale and the Storm (1\)
**Sayaka:** \.\.\.\.\.\.This, isn't good\.  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.What's wrong\? Umm, Itomi\.\.\. Sayaka-san\?  
**Sayaka:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.It isn't good, this pattern\.  
**Mihono:** What does that mean\? Please\.\.\. HYA\!  
**Mihono:** Explain\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** A little more\! HYA\!  
**Sayaka:** \.\.\.When we beat one, the next comes\.  
**Kofuki:** Ahh, c'mon, Sayaka\! You gotta use your words\! Listen up, Minoseki toji\. What Sayaka's trying to say is, we've seen this pattern before\.  
**Kofuki:** There's been a lot of these lately\. You think it's a bunch of small fry, but then bigger ones start taking their place and suddenly you're surrounded\.  
**Kofuki:** \.\.\.Well, I can take on all the aradama-chan they can throw at me, so it's no big deal\!  
**Mihono:** Hey\! Wait up, you two\! What's up with them, no one's coordinating at all\!\?  
**Mihono:** (Ngh\! My focus is slipping too\.\.\. What do I do\.\.\. The situation's getting worse and worse\.\.\. Ahhh, damnit\! It's always like this\! Is this all I can manage\!\?\)  
**Mihono:** Pant\.\.\. Pant\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** (All I can do is try to force through their numbers\.\.\.\! \.\.\.\! Ah, behind me\!\? I can't block in time\!\)  
**\?\?\?:** That was dangerous, huh\? We made it in the nick of time\!  
**Mihono:** (\! \.\.\.\.Who\!\?\)  
**Mihono:** (That uniform's the same as Chii-nee\.\.\. Toji from Osafune Girls' Academy\?\)  
**Ellen:** Kohagura Ellen and Mashiko Kaoru are here to assist\!  
**Ellen:** We're in a big big hurry to the tournament, but this is more important now\!  
**Kaoru:** Quit the small talk\. Nene and I'll take care of this\. C'mon out, Nene\.  
**Nene:** Ne-\!  
**Ellen:** Oh\! You're so shy, Kaoru-chan\!  

## 4: The Gale and the Storm (2\)
**Mihono:** (These two, they're so strong\.\.\.\!\)  
**Mihono:** (Kohagura Ellen-san\.\.\.\)  
**Mihono:** (She's using her toji skills to make the best of hand-to-hand techniques\.\.\. I think that's Taisha-ryu\.\)  
**Mihono:** (Looking at her, you wouldn't think she's so light-footed\. And yet, the impact of her hits\.\.\. The way she fights is so brutal, yet beautiful\.\.\. I've never seen an infighter like this\!\)  
**Mihono:** (And then\.\.\. Mashiko Kaoru-san\.\.\.\)  
**Mihono:** (She's so small that her okatana must be twice her height\.\.\. And yet, she's slamming it around so easily\.\.\. She's like a mini-tank\.\.\.\)  
**Mihono:** (But\.\.\.\)  
**Mihono:** (What's most amazing is the way they're in perfect sync with each other\.\.\. Yeah\.\.\. With these two here, I think we can win this\!\)  

## 5: A Toji's Duty (1\)
**Kofuki:** Oi, Sayaka\! With backup here, this is your chance\! Hurry and get to the tournament\!  
**Sayaka:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Kofuki:** Go on already\! If you don't show up for your match, the president's gonna be crazy pissed\!  
**Sayaka:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Ehh\!\? Is it really okay for her to go\!\? I mean, I know she's in the tournament, but\.\.\.  
**Kofuki:** Eh\? Isn't it great\? With Sayaka gone, that's even more aradama I get to kill\!  
**Kofuki:** And that means I really get to go wild\!  
**Mihono:** Eh\!\? Shichinosato-san\!\? She already ran off\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** What's her deal\. Is she alright in the head\?  
**Ellen:** Japan is a big place\. There's all kinds of toji here\.  
**Ellen:** \.\.\.Anyway, let's leave the aradama to her for now\. We need to help evacuate anyone still in the area\.  
**Kaoru:** 'kay\.  
**Ellen:** You too, Minoseki toji\. I can tell you're exhausted from the way you're having trouble keeping your okatana up, but we could really use your help\.  
**Mihono:** Ah\.\.\. Okay\! I'll do what I can\!  
**Nene:** Ne-  
**Kaoru:** You hide for now, Nene\. You're an aradama too\. That psycho'd probably come after you if she saw you\.  

## 6: A Toji's Duty (2\)
**Riot Policeman:** The riot squad is here\! There are 24 of us ready to help\!  
**Ellen:** We were waiting for you\! Good work gathering so quick\!  
**Ellen:** We'll go ahead and leave this to you\!  
**Kaoru:** Riot cops\.\.\.\? Not even the special ritual squad\? They expect these guys to deal with aradama\? Can they really handle this\?  
**Ellen:** Oh, Kaoru\! That's rude\! Ah, officers, I'm sorry\! She didn't mean anything by it\!  
**Riot Policeman:** Don't worry about it\. In fact\.\.\.  
**Riot Policeman:** With their numbers reduced to this degree, we can surround the area and guide anyone out\. From there, we'll hold our positions until the toji take care of them\.  
**Riot Policeman:** And I'd like to thank you all for your speedy arrival in helping citizens escape and exterminating the aradama\. In place of the people who live here, I am very grateful\.  
**Kaoru:** You should be\.  
**Ellen:** Quiet, Kaoru\. Um, Mr\. Policeman, you don't need to thank us\!  
**Kaoru:** We just did what we had to do\.  
**Ellen:** That's right, it's only natural\. Anyway, if we can leave this to you, the two of us need to get to the tournament venue\!  
**Kaoru:** Yeah\.  

## 7: Don't Think You're Getting Away\! (1\)
**Riot Policeman:** Encirclement complete\! Begin a search for anyone unable to escape\! Keep them safe at all costs\!  
**Mihono:** They're so coordinated\.\.\. Those riot police are real pros\.  
**Kofuki:** Tch, lame\. I thought I had the place to myself, but they're getting in the way of my prey\!  
**Mihono:** Shichinosato-san\.\.\.\?  
**Riot Policeman:** Shichinosato Kofuki-san, Asakura Mihono-san, are you alright\?  
**Mihono:** Ah, yes\!  
**Kofuki:** What do you want\? I'm in a real bad mood after getting my fun interrupted\!  
**Riot Policeman:** You see\.\.\. Even though we circled the area, it seems several aradama managed to slip through\.  
**Kofuki:** Huh\? And you want someone to hunt them down\? You want me to hunt them down\? I get to hunt them down\?  
**Riot Policeman:** Yes\. I realize this may be a lot to ask of you, however\.\.\.  
**Kofuki:** Say what\!\?  
**Riot Policeman:** I-I'm very sorry-  
**Kofuki:** No way\! You shoulda said that sooner\! So, c'mon, where'd they go\? I'll tear 'em apart\! C'mon\! Tell me\!  
**Mihono:** Uh, I'll be going after her\!  
**Riot Policeman:** Understood\! I'm counting on you\!  

## 8: Don't Think You're Getting Away\! (2\)
**Mihono:** Phew\.\.\. Seems like we took care of them all\.  
**Kofuki:** \.\.\.Heh, was that all they had\?  
**Riot Policeman:** Thank you very much, you two\! With your help, we were able to safely protect the citizens\.  
**Riot Policeman:** I realize this was an urgent request, especially right before the tournament, and for that I'm very sorry\.  
**Mihono:** Ah\! The tournament\! It's going to start any minute now\! Shichinosato-san, we've gotta get goi\.\.\. She already left\!\?  
**Riot Policeman:** She left without saying a word just a moment ago\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** When was that-\!\?  

## 9: Onward\! To the Tournament Venue\!
**Mihono:** Pant, pant, I finally made it\! The tournament, it seems like I made it in time\.\.\.\!\?  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.Now, what's the mood like in the assembly hall\?  
**Mihono:** Amazing, this stillness\.\.\. This sense of anticipation\! Ahh, man\! I can't get enough of it\! You can feel it; this is a fight to decide the greatest toji\!  
**Mihono:** That's right\.\.\. Every year, the Origami family, who are responsible for unifying and organizing the toji, host this tournament\. Which means it's a true test of skill for all who hold an okatana\.  
**Mihono:** Even these days, the name of the Origami family has carried a great deal of trustworthiness in their management of Okatana\. The Origami are an old and influential family\.\.\. (In Japanese history, official documents were sometimes folded with origami as proof of their authenticity\. Mihono mentions the phrase for that as possibly originating from the Origami family name due to their history and honor\.\)  
**Mihono:** Under the control and management of the Origami family, toji disciplines split into five training schools: The Five Traditions\.  
**Mihono:** Kanagawa's Renpu Girls' School, Gifu's Minoseki Academy, Nara's Heijou Institute\.\.\. And then Kyoto's Ayanokouji Martial Arts School, along with Okayama's Osafune Girls' Academy\. At this tournament, representatives from these five schools enter a fierce competition together\.  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.To put it bluntly, I wanted to enter too-\!  
**Mihono:** I mean, to be honest, my skills might be middle of the road, but\.\.\. If the matches were on a short timer\! Then I'd do better\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** In fact, if they were lightning rounds I feel like no one could beat me\.\.\. If I could just focus a little longer, even Kanami would've\.\.\. Even Kanami\.\.\.\.\.\. I oughta stop, yeah\.  
**Mihono:** (Anyway, my seat is\.\.\.\)  
**Friend B:** MIHONO-\! HERE, OVER HERE-\!  
**Mihono:** Ah\! I'm back, you two\!  
**Friend A:** You idiots\! Stop shouting\! Mihono, they just finished saying the pledge and the first round is about to start\! Look, it's Kanami versus Ayaonokouji's representative\!  
**Friend A:** \.\.\.This is it, the final round\. I wasn't sure if Kanami would make it this far\.\.\.  
**Friend B:** Yeah, yeah\! It's too bad about Mai, but her opponent was Kanami after all\. If only they'd faced off in the finals instead of the semi-finals\!  
**Mihono:** It's a real shame\~\. But, you know\.\.\.\.\.\. Huh\? In the stands over there\.\.\. Is that\? Chii-nee\!\? She said she was going back to Osafune yesterday\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** (Ahh-\! That's why she said we'd meet again soon-\!\)  
**Chie:** Fufu, I think Mihono-chan spotted me\. I was hoping I could surprise her again afterwards, so that's too bad\.  
**Chie:** (That girl in the finals\.\.\. Etou Kanami-san\.\.\. At a glance she just barely won every one of her matches, but if Mihono says she's strong then I can believe it\.\.\.\)  
**Chie:** (Her opponent in the finals is Heijou Institute's Juujou Hiyori-san\.\.\. I don't think she can overwhelm her, but if she can adapt and outmaneuver her it should be her win\.\)  
**Chie:** (Though, that okatana\.\.\. Huh, that looks like Kogarasumaru\.\.\. It can't be the real one, can it\.\.\.\?\)  
**Mihono:** Hmph\. Chii-nee, if you were coming here you should've said something\.\.\.  
**Friend A:** What's wrong, Mihono\?  
**Mihono:** Ah, it's nothing\! More importantly\! The match is about to begin\!  

## 10: As the Curtain Rises, the Attack Begins
The tournament stadium was enveloped in an odd stillness\. The tension before the match played a part, but there was another reason\.\.\.

  
Gazing out from the front of the arena was distinguished seating for noble guests\. From behind this seat, a door opened and the bamboo blind was raised\. Accompanied by a toji, a lone woman stepped into the sunlight\.

  
--------Origami Yukari\.

  
Twenty years ago, there was a great disaster\. At the time, at the age of only 17, Origami Yukari suppressed it and became known as a hero\. Rising to the head of the Origami family, she replaced a great number of influential people\. Her beauty, unchanged in twenty years, was plainly visible as she walked forward\.

  
For the head of the Origami family to show herself\.\.\. It became a cause for commotion; an unforgettable event expressed in a collective sigh of admiration\.

  
Though everyone was overwhelmed, the head of the family sat silent\. It was as though, until the match was announced to begin, she would not move even an atom\.

  
**Referee:** We will now prepare for the match to begin\.\.\. Bow\!  
At the referee's signal, the two turned and bowed to one another\.

  
Kanami's gaze was firmly locked on Hiyori\. There was a sharp glint in Hiyori's eyes, however\.\.\. She wasn't looking at Kanami\.

  
Under the eyes of all who had come to see, from toji to those who knew nothing of swords\.\.\.

  
All spectators caught and held their breath for what was about to come\.

  
**Referee:** Both of you\.\.\. Utsushi\!  
The two's bodies became enveloped in a glow that would protect them from harm\. This was the battle armor of a toji:  
utsushi\. A power belonging only to those who hold an okatana\. Their ordinarily frail body protected by the netherworld; a temporary body takes its place\. It allows them to escape death once, though after that the body vanishes\.

  
Utsushi prepared, the two stood ready to face one another\.

  
Etou Kanami, adapting to the moment, raised herself into the Mugyou no Kurai stance\. Juujou Hiyori, lowering her center of balance, adopted the Sha no Kamae stance\. Both were old stances, both equally unexpected\.

  
And, at that moment, the curtain was raised\.

  
**Referee:** Begin\!  
In an instant, the world was turned on its head-

  
Juujou Hiyori vanished from the arena\. In a split second, before even a thought could pass, it became clear what she had done\.

  
**Hiyori:** (She deflected it\!\?\)  
**Yukari:** Third stage jin'i without preparation\. Is this your \"single sword\"\?  
**Hiyori:** Absurd\.\.\.\!  
**Hiyori:** (She was completely defenseless\! And yet, where did Origami Yukari pull those two okatana from\!\?\)  
**Yukari:** Have you come to erase your mother's regrets\? Fufu\.\.\. But taking Origami Yukari's head won't be so easy\.  
**Hiyori:** Tch\.\.\.\!  
**Maki:** That's as far as you go, traitor\! HAA\!  
**Hiyori:** (No\! \.\.\.She's got me\!\)  
**Maki:** Minoseki's\.\.\. Etou Kanami\! How dare you interfere\!  
**Hiyori:** What, are\!\? No, why did you save me\!\?  
**Kanami:** Just come with me\! Hurry\!
