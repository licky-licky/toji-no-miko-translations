## 4: An Atmosphere of Unrest
**Akira:** Seriously? People won't stop calling today... Tch, and it just had to be these assholes.  
**Akira:** Yeah?  
**???:** If you're entering the large scale aradama outbreak, you are to gather as much noro from it as possible.  
**Akira:** Huhh? Have you lost your damn mind? Try getting your priorities straight here\!  
**???:** For that person's desire to be realized, a great amount of noro is needed.  
**???:** Inago Akira, you do understand, don't you?  
**Akira:** You sure love running your mouth, huh. You think naming them would make me do whatever you say?  
**???:** Everything is to fulfill that desire. It isn't as if I'm telling you to ignore the aradama, you know.  
**???:** Suppress the aradama, retrieve their noro, and... Keep an eye on the girl. You can do that, can't you?  
**Akira:** ...  
**Akira:** Yeah, sure, I got it\! While I'm suppressing the aradama, I'll get you some noro\!  
**Akira:** That good enough for you\!?  
**???:** We have high expectations.  
**Akira:** FUCK\!  
**Akira:** ...Sigh.  
**Akira:** Ahh, feels a little better letting it out like that\! Damnit, this is starting to get on my nerves.  
**Toji A:** Defend this position, no matter what\!  
**Tojis:** Right\!  
**Mihono:** There's this many aradama\!?  
**Hana:** It's like this everywhere inside. We keep killing them and killing them... And more aradama appear.  
**Hana:** That's why we left our unit at a key location and went to secure an escape route.  
**Mihono:** ...  
**Hana:** Looking at it the other way, they can't move from there. So we have to force our way in.  
**Mihono:** Okay\!  
**???:** No\! Stay away\!  
**Mihono:** Suzumoto-san, someone's calling for help\!  
**Hana:** ...That way, huh. Let's hurry, Asakura-san\!  
**Mihono:** There she is\!  
**Hana:** HAAAAAA\!\!  
**Woman:** ...  
**Mihono:** Are you okay\!?  
**Hana:** Don't move her\!  
**Hana:** ...There's no injury on her head, and she doesn't seem badly hurt... Alright, she only lost consciousness is all.  
**Hana:** It should be okay if we wake her up.  
**Mihono:** H-Hang on a minute\!  
**Hana:** What is it?  
**Mihono:** Ah, uh, it's just...  
**Mihono:** (What if she starts acting the same as the people outside...)  
**Mihono:** I think she was really scared of getting attacked by aradama... Wouldn't it be better if we let her stay asleep?  
**Hana:** You have a point there.  
**Mihono:** ...What's most important for us now is finding Yamashiro-san. I'll look to see if there's someone else around who can help her.  
**Hana:** I'm counting on you.  
**Hana:** I didn't expect that from you back there.  
**Mihono:** Huh?  
**Hana:** I was sure you'd offer to go and bring her outside yourself.  
**Mihono:** Should I have?  
**Hana:** No, it's good you didn't let your emotions get the better of you. You're right that we should focus on meeting up with Yui first.  
**Mihono:** (Didn't let my emotions get the better of me? I did though...)  
**Mihono:** Suzumoto-san\!  
**Hana:** Stay quiet... We can let this aradama go.  
**Mihono:** Aren't we going to beat it?  
**Hana:** Our number one priority is rescuing the people here. I know it sounds bad, but... Stopping the aradama comes second.  
**Hana:** Good, it doesn't seem like it's noticed us.  
**Mihono:** ...  
**Hana:** Feeling frustrated?  
**Mihono:** That's not it; there's just something on my mind... Um, can I ask you something?  
**Hana:** What's that?  
**Mihono:** Suzumoto-san, why did you choose to be transferred?  
**Hana:** Why?  
**Mihono:** My school's president asked me too; if I wanted to transfer.  
**Mihono:** But back then, I told her no.  
**Hana:** President Hashima must have high hopes for you, Asakura-san.  
**Mihono:** She does...?  
**Hana:** Yeah. It's very hard working here, so they'd never recommend a toji without the strength to back it up.  
**Mihono:** Ah...  
**Hana:** Are you getting interested?  
**Hana:** When I decided to transfer, I was thinking about the future. I wanted to build up a connection with the police.  
**Mihono:** Suzumoto-san... You're so mature.  
**Hana:** You think so?  
**???:** HAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Mihono:** That voice was... Yamashiro-san\!  

## 5:ã€€At a Crossroads
**Aradama:** OOOOOOOOUUUUU\!\!  
**Yui:** Whagh\!  
**Yui:** That's it for my utsushi... But, I'm not done yet\!  
**Yui:** HAAAAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Yui:** Pant... Pant...  
**Man A:** H-Hey, are you doing okay?  
**Yui:** I'm fine, it's fine, this is a walk in the park\!  
**Yui:** ...ah, whoops.  
**Man A:** Look at you, you can barely stand up straight\!  
**Yui:** Ahaha, I think I'm just getting a little hungry.  
**Man A:** Why don't you rest for a while?  
**Yui:** When Hana-san gets back, I'll take a break. Don't worry, she'll be back any minute now.  
**Man A:** Still...  
**Hana:** Yui\!  
**Man A:** It's that girl from before, and she brought help\! Good, now you can get some rest.  
**Yui:** Ooh\! And she's a cutie too... Wait, that's Mihono-chan\!  
**Hana:** Mihono-chan? Yui, since when have you and Asakura-san been on a first name basis?  
**Yui:** Never, but I'm in the camp that believes in calling cute girls by their first name\!  
**Hana:** I figured... Sorry about her, Asakura-san.  
**Mihono:** Ahaha, I'm totally okay with it\! I'll call you Yui too then.  
**Yui:** Thanks, Mihono-chan\! I feel like I could fight for another five hours now.  
**Hana:** Five hours? You're keeping it realistic, huh.  
**Man B:** What are you standing around gossiping for\!? If you've got more toji, then start getting us out of here\!  
**Mihono:** -\!  
**Mihono:** (They're like this here too...)  
**Man A:** Don't talk to them like that\! These girls are risking their lives fighting for us\!  
**Woman:** You shouldn't pay him any mind. Thank you, for coming all this way... Really, truly, thank you...  
**Woman:** It was horrible... So many times, I thought it was all over...  
**Mihono:** Ah...  
**Mihono:** ...You don't have to worry\! We'll keep you all safe, no matter what\!  
**Yui:** Then, let's get to it... whoops.  
**Hana:** Don't overdo it, Yui. Asakura-san and I will keep guard, so you can take a quick break.  
**Yui:** Ugh, sorry. I'll do that.  
**Hana:** Oh, right.  
**Hana:** Do you mind if I ask why you decided to transfer, Yui?  
**Yui:** Where's this coming from? Could it be, you're just so interested in me you can't help it\!?  
**Hana:** Asakura-san asked me about it before. Now seemed like a good time, so I figured I'd ask you too.  
**Mihono:** Thanks, Suzumoto-san.  
**Yui:** Does that mean you're joining us, Mihono-chan?  
**Mihono:** Uhh, I'm considering it... After seeing things here, I started feeling sort of conflicted, I guess?  
**Yui:** I see, so there's a chance, huh.  
**Yui:** Hmm, okay. I guess I did it for the money? See, if you get loaned to the police, they start paying you a bit more.  
**Mihono:** ...I kind of wasn't expecting that from you.  
**Yui:** Fu fu fu, at Ayanokouji, they don't call me "the girl you never see coming" for nothing\!  
**Hana:** Did that help you any?  
**Mihono:** Yeah. I can tell you and Yui both put a lot of thought into why you transferred.  
**Mihono:** And I...  
**Mihono:** (All I thought about was whether I'd stay with everyone. I should really... Think about it harder now.)  
**Mihono:** What was that sound\!?  
**Hana:** It sounded like glass breaking, but... It's sort of unsettling not knowing what happened.  
**Mihono:** I'll go check it out then\! Suzumoto-san and Yui-san, you stay here\!  
**???:** ORA\!  
**Mihono:** (Somebody's fighting?)  
**Mihono:** (The broken glass... Is that a motorcycle? Did the motorcycle come crashing through?)  
**Mihono:** (But why in here...?)  
**???:** C'mon, I don't have time for you small fry. Quit swarming me, damnit.  
**Mihono:** (She's backup? She's wearing a Minoseki uniform, but... I've never seen her before.)  
**???:** Finally...  
**Mihono:** (\!? She's collecting the noro? Why is she doing that now, like she's hiding it...)  
**Mihono:** That's enough\!  
**???:** Huh?  
**Mihono:** I'm Asakura Mihono, second year at Minoseki Academy's middle school division\! What are you doing out here?  
**???:** ...Asakura Mihono.  
**???:** ('Course she'd be suspicious of a toji acting on their own in a place like this.)  
**???:** (Wasn't planning on making contact yet, but... Can't exactly explain what I was doing with the noro to her...)  
**Mihono:** ...  
**???:** (Kashuu Kiyomitsu... It really is broken.)  
**???:** (Or, well...)  
**???:** You've gotta lot of nerve, don'tcha? Just gonna point your okatana at your senpai like that? Huhh?  
**Mihono:** ...First, just answer me this. What are you doing here?  
**???:** First, gimme an apology for pulling your okatana on me. I'm your senpai, y'know?  
**Mihono:** ...  
**???:** ...You asked for it.  
**???:** (For starters, I'll knock some sense into this bratty kouhai of mine\! I can come up with something after\!)  

## 6: Evaluation
**Mihono:** ...  
**Mihono:** (This girl, she was collecting noro in secret...)  
**Mihono:** (The head of the Origami family was doing the same thing, when she was possessed by Tagitsuhime...)  
**Mihono:** (Whatever her reason, I'd better stop her\!)  
**???:** It's not in me to waste breath arguing.  
**???:** Let's go.  
**Mihono:** -\!?  
**Mihono:** (That was so fast... And she hits hard too\!)  
**???:** HAAA\!\!  
**Mihono:** Grh\!  
**Mihono:** (She's... Really strong\!)  
**???:** (...She's got some muscle. But, eh, that's how it is.)  
**???:** ...Alright, I get the gist of it.  
**Mihono:** Of what?  
**???:** (Can't go wasting much time here in these circumstances.)  
**???:** Just say goodnight for now\!  
**Mihono:** ...\!\!  
**Mihono:** ...  
**???:** Man, what're they teaching in the middle school these days? Don't go turning your okatana on your senpai like that.  
**???:** ...Well, actually, I guess it was my fault this time.  
**Yui:** Mihono-chan\!  
**???:** Huh?  
**Yui:** GET AWAY FROM MIHONO-CHAAAAAAN\!  
**???:** Thought you'd get me by surprise\!? Too bad; I'm used to that\!\!  
**Yui:** Gh...  
**???:** What was with her?  
**Hana:** ...What do you think you're doing, Inago-san?  
**Akira:** Me? She's the one who jumped me. Wait, do I know you?  
**Hana:** Suzumoto Hana. I've seen you a few times through Mokusa.  
**Akira:** ...Ohh, you're with Mokusa too. That's perfect.  
**Akira:** I'm juggling what Mokusa and President Hashima want from me. Things've been getting annoying, so I was going it alone, and this one spotted me.  
**Hana:** ...Is that how it went.  
**Hana:** (President Hashima likely told her to do the same thing she told Mihono... So what did Mokusa want her to do?)  
**Hana:** (Well, she probably wouldn't give me an answer even if I asked.)  
**Akira:** That's my story, so when they wake up, I'm counting on you to help explain.  
**Hana:** Please try explaining things yourself before you get into a fight...  
**Akira:** Hey, they're the ones pointing their okatana at me?  
**Akira:** If someone tries putting me down, I'll make them regret it.  
**Hana:** Anyway, that's Inago Akira-san.  
**Akira:** I'm Inago Akira. Good to meet you.  
**Akira:** Sorry about before; I just took you out on reflex.  
**Yui:** No, don't worry about it\! More importantly... Can I call you Boss\!?  
**Akira:** Sure, call me whatever.  
**Yui:** Will do\!  
**Akira:** And, I didn't mean for things to get out of hand before, Mihono. I lost my cool and wasn't thinking straight.  
**Mihono:** No, I shouldn't have taken out my okatana before I even asked you anything.  
**Mihono:** Though, if President Hashima sent you, you should've said so sooner.  
**Akira:** My bad, but President Hashima didn't tell me anything more than to head over here.  
**Akira:** So, to make it up to you, let me help you guys out.  
**Akira:** I won't feel right if I don't pay you back.  
**Mihono:** Sure, we'd be glad to have you, Inago-san\!  
**Akira:** Akira's fine, Mihono.  
**Mihono:** Okay\! Akira-san\!  
**Mihono:** (Still... Why was she taking that noro? Was that part of President Hashima's orders too?)
