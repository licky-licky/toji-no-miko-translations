## [Mahou Shoujo - Kanami: Start]: Were You Going Easy?
**Sayaka:** Are you ready?  
**Kanami:** Sure, Sayaka-chan.  
**Fate:** I'm ready to go too, Sayaka-san.  
**Sayaka:** Then... Start.  
**Kanami:** Come at me anytime, Fate-chan. I want to see your swordsmanship.  
**Fate:** ...I'll give it my full strength\!  
**Fate:** YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Kanami:** --\!  
**Kanami:** (Uwahh\! She was just right in front of me, but she vanished in a second\!)  
**Kanami:** (She's seriously fast\!)  
**Kanami:** (But...)  
**Kanami:** (Her swordfighting comes so head on. So that's how Fate-chan is\!)  
**Kanami:** I'll go at you next, Fate-chan\!  
**Fate:** Okay\!  
**Sayaka:** ...That's enough.  
**Fate:** [pant pant]...  
**Kanami:** [pant pant]... Ahh.  
**Kanami:** That was so fun, Fate-chan\!  
**Fate:** You were smiling, Kanami-san.  
**Kanami:** Eh?  
**Fate:** In the middle of our match, you smiled a few times.  
**Kanami:** Ah--... Haha, you were just so strong, Fate-chan, I couldn't help but smile.  
**Fate:** ...I understand.  
**Fate:** I don't dislike fighting seriously either... Because, when you fight with all you have, your feelings can come across through it.  
**Kanami:** I know what you mean\!  
**Kanami:** You feel like you can really understand someone through their sword.  
**Kanami:** --\! Sayaka-chan\!  
**Sayaka:** I'm ready whenever.  
**Fate:** Is it aradama?  
**Kanami:** Yeah. Sorry, Fate-chan.  
**Fate:** ...I'd like to help out too. Would that be a problem?  
**Kanami:** No, that'd be great\! Let's go, Sayaka-chan\! Fate-chan\!  

## [Mahou Shoujo - Kanami: End]: Go Ahead
**Fate:** YAAAAAAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Kanami:** Let me finish it off\!\!  
**Aradama:** GGII...  
**Fate:** I'm moving to the next one\!  
**Kanami:** Okay\!\!  
**Kanami:** ...Man, you're incredible, Fate-chan.  
**Sayaka:** Kanami, while you were fighting, you were staring at Fate. Why is that?  
**Kanami:** I was thinking, I might be able to take something away from how Fate-chan moves around.  
**Sayaka:** Like what?  
**Kanami:** What sets Fate-chan apart is her speed, right?  
**Kanami:** So, if I could capture that with jin'i, I might be able to borrow what makes Fate-chan so good.  
**Sayaka:** You're right, Kanami. I want to try learning from her too.  
**Sayaka:** [stare]...  
**Kanami:** [stare]...  
**Fate:** Kanami-san? Sayaka-san?  
**Fate:** We still haven't finished defeating all of them, so isn't it dangerous to be looking away from your opponent?  
**Kanami:** Y-Yeah, that's true\! Let's get focused, Sayaka-chan\!  
**Sayaka:** Alright.  
**Kanami:** HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Aradama:** ......  
**Kanami:** There's no more readings on the spectrum finder, so that should mean our mission's done.  
**Sayaka:** Mm.  
**Fate:** So... Why were the both of you watching me, Kanami-san, Sayaka-san?  
**Fate:** It was a bit... embarrassing...   
**Kanami:** Ahh, sorry about that, Fate-chan\!  
**Kanami:** I guess you could call it training by observing... We were wondering if we could take something from the way you move around.  
**Fate:** So that's what it was.  
**Fate:** Then, if learning from my movements is good enough for you... Go ahead.  
**Kanami:** Hooray\!   
**Kanami:** Then, when we get back, I want to talk it all over\! Actually, there's this move you did I was curious about\!  
**Fate:** E-Eh?  
**Sayaka:** There's something I wanted to ask too.  
**Kanami:** See, see\! C'mon, Fate-chan, let's hurry on back\!  
**Fate:** ...Okay\!

## [Mahou Shoujo - Yomi: Start]: Similar to Someone
**Aradama:** OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\!\!  
**Yomi:** So they were here after all.  
**Nanoha:** I'll support you, Yomi-san\! Bind\!   
**Aradama:** GAAAAAAAA\!\?  
**Yomi:** --\!  
**Yomi:** Thank you for the assistance, Takamachi-san.  
**Nanoha:** I'm just glad that I managed to help you out.  
**Yomi:** With that taken care of, let's move on ahead.  
**Nanoha:** Right\!  
**Aradama:** BYAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\!\!  
**Yomi:** ...Kh.  
**Yomi:** --\!\!  
**Aradama:** GYAAAAAA...  
**Yomi:** Phew...  
**Nanoha:** Are you okay, Yomi-san\!\?  
**Yomi:** I have utsushi. This isn't enough to be a problem.  
**Nanoha:** ...Is it... always like this?  
**Yomi:** What do you mean?  
**Nanoha:** When you're fighting aradama... Do you always fight them like this?  
**Yomi:** Yes.  
**Nanoha:** ...That must be hard.  
**Yomi:** That's my duty.  
**Nanoha:** ......  
**Nanoha:** Yomi-san, you're...  
**Yomi:** What about me?  
**Nanoha:** I get the feeling you're like someone I know...  
**Yomi:** Is that right.  
**Yomi:** Let's move on ahead.  
**Nanoha:** Ah, please wait for me\!  
**Nanoha:** (Hmm, but who was it though?)  

## [Mahou Shoujo - Yomi: End]: Yomi and Nanoha
**Aradama:** Oooooo...  
**Yomi:** ...Phew.  
**Yomi:** That aradama seems to have been the last of them. Thank you for accompanying me.  
**Nanoha:** It's no problem...  
**Nanoha:** Um... Is it okay if I ask you something? ...Why did you become a toji, Yomi-san?  
**Yomi:** ...  
**Nanoha:** Watching you... I realized who it is you remind me of.  
**Yomi:** And that is...?  
**Nanoha:** Fate-chan, from when I first met her.  
**Yomi:** Harlaown-san?  
**Nanoha:** Yes. When I first met Fate-chan, she was fighting so hard for her mother's sake... And, we were also enemies at first...  
**Nanoha:** The look in your eyes, Yomi-san, it's like Fate-chan was back then...  
**Nanoha:** Is it the same for you, Yomi-san? Did you... become a toji for somebody else's sake?  
**Yomi:** ...I'm different from Harlaown-san.  
**Yomi:** I became a toji for my own sake.  
**Nanoha:** Oh...  
**Nanoha:** Um, I'm sorry for saying something strange like that\!  
**Yomi:** It's fine.  
**Yomi:** I...  
**Aradama:** OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\!\!  
**Nanoha:** \!\?  
**Yomi:** Watch out\!  
**Yomi:** Grgh...\!  
**Nanoha:** Yomi-san\!  
**Yomi:** I'm... alright. Takamachi-san, take care of the aradama...  
**Nanoha:** R-Right\!  
**Nanoha:** Here goes... Full power\! Divine... Buster\!  
**Yomi:** With that, the mission is fully complete.  
**Nanoha:** Um... Thank you very much\!  
**Yomi:** You don't need to thank me.  
**Nanoha:** ...  
**Nanoha:** I really do think you're like Fate-chan, Yomi-san.  
**Yomi:** You do?  
**Nanoha:** I do.  
**Nanoha:** Like Fate-chan... you're very kind\!  
**Yomi:** ...  
**Yomi:** Let's go back, Takamachi-san.  
**Nanoha:** Sure, Yomi-san\!

## [Mahou Shoujo - Tsugumi: Start]: Tsugumi-san Can Do Anything
**Announcement:** --An outbreak of aradama has been confirmed. Please follow instructions from officials and evacuate immediately.  
**Announcement:** I repeat--  
**Tsugumi:** Okay... Alright, I see. Thank you.  
**Tsugumi:** It sounds like the evacuation of the civilians has finished, everyone.  
**Nanoha:** Was there anybody who got hurt?  
**Tsugumi:** No, they all seem to be fine. Thank you for your concern though.  
**Fate:** That's good to hear.  
**Yume:** Alright then, I'm going with Fate-chan, so you can be with Nanoha-chan, Onee-san\!  
**Fate:** Ah\! Wait for me, Yume-san\!  
**Nanoha:** ...They ran off.  
**Tsugumi:** There's no helping it now. Since we've both been left behind, let's give it our best effort.  
**Nanoha:** Okay\! I'm glad to be with you, Tsugumi-san\!  
**Tsugumi:** Likewise.  
**Tsugumi:** Compared to Tsubakuro-san, I'm far less capable, so I'll be relying on your support, Takamachi-san-.  
**Nanoha:** Yume-san really is strong, isn't she.  
**Tsugumi:** That's a part of it, but... I did retire once.  
**Nanoha:** You... retired?  
**Tsugumi:** Yes. I returned to the action for a number of reasons, but my expertise is working behind the scenes.  
**Nanoha:** What do you do working behind the scenes?  
**Tsugumi:** I take care of research into aradama, or acting as operator for mock battles, among other things.  
**Nanoha:** You seem like you can do just about anything, Tsugumi-san.  
**Tsugumi:** ...  
**Tsugumi:** I wasn't expecting to hear such a blunt compliment just now.  
**Tsugumi:** I'm a little embarrassed.  
**Tsugumi:** Though... It isn't really all that impressive. I'm only doing the things I'm interested in doing.  
**Tsugumi:** Besides, from my perspective, you're far more impressive than I am, Takamachi-san.  
**Nanoha:** Ahaha, thank you very much.  
**Tsugumi:** Anyway, that's enough standing around chatting. Let's move out.  
**Tsugumi:** It wouldn't be good for us to be too leisurely and leave all the work to Tsubakuro-san and Harlaown-san.  
**Nanoha:** That's true\!  

## [Mahou Shoujo - Tsugumi: End]: Tsugumi-san is Strange
**Aradama:** GYAOOOOOOOOOOOOO\!  
**Nanoha:** Soul Shooter\!  
**Aradama:** ooo...  
**Tsugumi:** You're shooting them down the instant we encounter them? You're doing well.  
**Tsugumi:** There might not be a reason for me to be here like this-.  
**Nanoha:** It's not like that\! Haven't you cut down lots of them yourself, Tsugumi-san?  
**Tsugumi:** Thank you for having my back.  
**Tsugumi:** Though, I would personally rather leave the suppression to you, so that I can observe the aradama-.  
**Nanoha:** ...Huh?  
**Nanoha:** (Tsugumi-san, she's a little...)  
**Tsugumi:** Were you thinking that's strange?  
**Nanoha:** How could you tell\!\?  
**Tsugumi:** You're an honest person, Takamachi-san. Though, I get that a lot.  
**Tsugumi:** Leaving that aside, magic sure is incredible, isn't it? If I heard right, not everyone on the Earth you're from can use magic, can they?  
**Nanoha:** A while ago, I had a sort of encounter... I found magic, and Yuuno-kun, and Fate-chan...  
**Nanoha:** And I learned I had the strength to help save someone too.  
**Tsugumi:** (The way she's talking about it... Is Takamachi-san unconsciously fighting to save others?)  
**Tsugumi:** (Then... that might make the people with her fairly anxious.)  
**Tsugumi:** ...It must be difficult.  
**Nanoha:** Eh? What's difficult?  
**Tsugumi:** Oh, just speaking to myself.  
**Tsugumi:** By the way, how do you defeat aradama with magic?  
**Nanoha:** Ah, right. That's because...  
**Nanoha:** What was that\!\?  
**Tsugumi:** I don't think that's the kind of sound that comes from fighting aradama... Did they run into trouble?  
**Tsugumi:** Though, considering those two, it doesn't seem likely...  
**Nanoha:** Let's go see\!\!  
**Yume:** Aha\! How about this\!  
**Fate:** Yume-san\! We're in the middle of a mission now\!  
**Yume:** We're making sure to beat the aradama, so it's fine\! Anyway... Let's do it some more, Fate-chan\!  
**Tsugumi:** ...Should we just pretend like we didn't see them?  
**Nanoha:** We can't do that\! Let's go in and stop them\!  
**Tsugumi:** If we have to. Let's go then.  
**Nanoha:** Right\!

## [Mahou Shoujo - Yume: Start]: Let's Go Together\!
**Yume:** Where'd she go... Ah, there you are\! Fate-chan\!  
**Fate:** Yume-san?  
**Yume:** Huh? What're you doing with Maki-onee-san?  
**Maki:** I was just hearing from her about the incident going on. What did you need, Yume?  
**Yume:** Aradama showed up, so I came to get her. Let's go together, Fate-chan.  
**Fate:** Aradama...? But...  
**Maki:** It's fine with me. Though, when you get back, I might have to talk with you again...  
**Fate:** ...Thank you, Maki-san.  
**Fate:** If helping out could reduce the damage they cause by even a little, I'll go along with you.  
**Yume:** Neat\! I'll be sure to show you a whole bunch of how strong I am\!  
**Fate:** Eh? But I know that you're strong, Yume-san.  
**Yume:** I can't wait\! Let's get there fast, Fate-chan\!  
**Tsugumi:** They've arrived at last... Oh? Why is Harlaown-san here?  
**Fate:** I accepted Yume-san's invitation to help.  
**Nanoha:** Ah, it's Fate-chan.  
**Fate:** Wait, Nanoha?  
**Tsugumi:** I asked Takamachi-san to assist me. We were working together just before this.  
**Nanoha:** Yomi-san was actually with us too, but she had to go someplace else.  
**Fate:** Is that how it happened. Let's do what we can, Nanoha.  
**Nanoha:** Sure, Fate-chan\!  
**Yume:** So anyway, why're you just standing around doing nothing here?  
**Tsugumi:** We were waiting for you, Tsubakuro-san.  
**Yume:** Oh, you were? Then, you can go back and leave the rest to me, Onee-san.  
**Tsugumi:** I probably could-.  
**Tsugumi:** We won't go back, but I'll count on you to do your best.  
**Yume:** Sure\!   
**Fate:** Umm... Is this going to be okay, Tsugumi-san?  
**Tsugumi:** Is what okay?  
**Fate:** The aradama... Isn't it going to be hard when they show up? I don't get that feeling from Yume-san...  
**Tsugumi:** Tsubakuro-san is plenty strong though-.  
**Tsugumi:** Since she doesn't struggle fighting aradama, there's not much sense of danger, so perhaps a part of her merely thinks of it as an extended game.  
**Fate:** Then, why is it that Yume-san became a toji?  
**Tsugumi:** Only Tsubakuro-san knows the answer to that.  
**Tsugumi:**  Though... Everything will be fine.  
**Fate:** Eh?  
**Tsugumi:** Tsubakuro-san is a toji too. Please have faith in her.  
**Fate:** ...Okay.  

## [Mahou Shoujo - Yume: End]: It's Not Like That\!\?
**Aradama:** GUOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\!\!  
**Yume:** YAAH\!  
**Aradama:** Oooo...  
**Yume:** Geez, there's nothing but weak aradama here\!  
**Yume:** How am I supposed to show Fate-chan how strong I am like this\!  
**Fate:** You don't need to go that far, Yume-san.  
**Fate:** I think it's incredible how you can defeat aradama the moment we find them.  
**Yume:** That's not really that incredible or anything.  
**Fate:** ...  
**Fate:** Why did you become a toji, Yume-san?  
**Yume:** Ehh? To show people what makes me so strong.  
**Fate:** What makes you strong?  
**Yume:** Yeah. That's why, I thought I'd get to show you too, Fate-chan, but...  
**Yume:** Wait, I know\!  
**Fate:** Yume-san?  
**Yume:** Since we have the chance, let's have some fun while we do this... Fate-chan\!  
**Fate:** --\!\?  
**Yume:** Aha\! Fighting with you really is fun, Fate-chan\!  
**Fate:** We're in the middle of a mission right now\!  
**Yume:** Yeah\! So, while we do the mission, let's fight, Fate-chan\!  
**Fate:** Kh... Stop this, Yume-san\!  
**Yume:** I'm not gonna\!  
**Aradama:** BGYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\!  
**Yume:** You're in the way\!  
**Fate:** (Yume-san... She actually is defeating aradama while fighting me.)  
**Fate:** (Showing others what makes her strong... Is that really so important to Yume-san?)  
**Yume:** C'mon, c'mon\! What's wrong, Fate-chan\!  
**Fate:** --\! YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Aradama:** ooooo...  
**Fate:** I'll be your opponent, but I'll only attack the aradama...  
**Fate:** Will that be alright?  
**Yume:** ...Aha\! It's fine with me\!  
**Tsugumi:** Okay, that's enough-.  
**Yume:** Ehhh\!\? What're you and Nanoha-chan doing here, Onee-san?  
**Tsugumi:** We heard something troubling going on, so we hurried over.  
**Nanoha:** Fate-chan, if you're going to fight with Yume-san, I think you should do it after the mission's over...  
**Fate:** Y-You've got it all wrong, Nanoha\! I was making sure to do the mission\!\?  
**Yume:** Geez, and it was just getting fun too. Let's pick up from here when we get back, Fate-chan.  
**Nanoha:** Fate-chan can get pretty intense when it comes to combat training...  
**Fate:** I told you, it's not like that\!\!
