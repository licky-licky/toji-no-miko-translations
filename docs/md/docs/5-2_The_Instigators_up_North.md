## 1: Worry
**Mihono:** This thing that's happening to me... Akira-san said they knew the reason why it's going rampant...  
**Mihono:** ...  
**Mihono:** What should I... do now? She said, "before it's too late," but...  
**Mihono:** ...  
**Mihono:** ......  
**Mihono:** .........  
**Mihono:** I can't tell anything thinking here like this\~\! I'll just have to ask them directly\!\!  
**Mirja:** Absolutely not.  
**Mihono:** Ehh\~\!\!  
**Chie:** Mmm, I think... I'm against it too.  
**Chie:** I'm worried, after you lost control again. And, this... Inago-san? We can't even be sure if she's telling the truth...  
**Mihono:** But, Kaoru-san said that Akira-san was from Mokusa too\!  
**Chie:**ã€€Even if she is... What we call Mokusa has lots of smaller factions to it...  
**Mihono:** It does?  
**Chie:** ...Yes. I don't know them all very well myself, but, aside from the main faction which aims to enshrine and suppress aradama, there are meant to be people with lots of different ideologies.  
**Mirja:** With all our research into Kashuu Kiyomitsu, we've found nothing but dead ends. They may say they know, but frankly I find that dubious at best.  
**Mirja:** Inago Akira... was it?  
**Mihono:** Ah, Akira-san was the one who said they knew, but she said the one who really knows is her childhood friend. I think her name was... Hitakami Makoto-san?  
**Chie:** Hitakami... Makoto?  
**Mirja:** Do you know her?  
**Chie:** Y-Yes. She's a toji from Osafune.  
**Chie:** Hitakami Makoto is a third year in Osafune Girls' Academy's high school division. It was only for a little while, but... we were in the same unit once too.  
**Mihono:** Come to think of it, I never really heard much about what you were doing back then. Did you get along with her?  
**Chie:** Well, I don't think we got along too badly. I was curious how she was doing... She's working hard it seems.  
**Mihono:** You seem kind of happy about it?  
**Chie:** Fufu, that's true.  
**Chie:** I wasn't expecting her name to come up here, so you caught me by surprise.  
**Chie:** If it's Makoto, I think it might be alright, but...  
**Mirja:** ...  
**Mihono:** What's Hitakami-san like, Chii-nee?  
**Chie:** A yamato nadeshiko. If I wanted to describe Makoto, there's no phrase that fits her better. 	[Just look up yamato nadeshiko to see a list of adjectives, but it's essentially the epitome of traits that make up an ideal Japanese woman.]  
**Chie:** She's gentle, and ladylike, and intelligent... Though, she could be stubborn too.  
**Chie:** On top of that, she had real skill as a toji.  
**Mirja:** This toji, Hitakami Makoto, she didn't participate in the tournament, did she?  
**Chie:** Osafune has Kaoru-san and Ellen-san there. It would be a little difficult fighting those two to be selected for the tournament.  
**Mirja:** I see...  
**Mirja:** (However, Inago Akira and Hitakami Makoto... For them to be so powerful, their names are relatively unknown...)  
**Mirja:** (...No, I must be reading too deeply into it.)  
**Chie:** Was there something that caught your attention?  
**Mirja:** ...There wasn't.  
**Mirja:** We should go speak with them in the near future. However, please wait just a little longer first.  
**Mihono:** A little longer?  
**Mirja:** Yes. In that time, I would like to find more on Inago Akira, Hitakami Makoto, and, the other one...  
**Mihono:** Yuuki. Toribane Yuuki.  
**Mirja:** Toribane Yuuki, was it. I'm going to gather information on these three.  
**Mihono:** Information...?  I don't think you have to go that far, do you...  
**Mirja:** You need to understand the gravity of the situation.  
**Mirja:** For Kashuu Kiyomitsu... For an okatana's power to go rampant is nothing to take lightly.  
**Mirja:** Things are the way they are because the investigation team is working directly under the Origami Family... But we have no way of knowing when that may change.  
**Mirja:** We need to act with caution right now.  
**Mihono:** ...Is the situation really that bad?  
**Mirja:** Without a doubt. You should assume that your situation is more unstable than you realize.  
**Mihono:** ...Alright.  
**Mirja:** In addition, no matter what comes up, please refrain from using Kashuu Kiyomitsu's power. Do you understand?  
**Mihono:** ......I understand.  
**Mirja:** (If I force the issue this much, she should avoid going rampant again for the time being.)  
**Mirja:** (If Asakura Mihono were to repeatedly lose control, her position will certainly worsen.)  
**Mirja:** (Though... There is now even more work to be done. I'll need to immediately find information on Hitakami Makoto, Inago Akira, and Toribane Yuuki...)  
**Mihono:** Aradama\!\?  
**Chie:** ...It's fine for you to wait on standby today, Mihono-chan.  
**Mihono:** No, I can fight even without using that power, and I'll feel better getting some exercise than sitting around worrying\!  
**Mirja:** Very well then.  
**Mirja:** ...The investigation team will sortie as soon as we've assembled\!  

## 2: Results of Investigating the Hitakami Faction
At that time--

  
**Yukari:** How is the investigation into Mokusa's extremist factions going?  
**Maki:** We've finished compiling data on all the related individuals. Yomi.  
**Yomi:** Yes, here it is.  
**Yume:** Hmm... Oh, huh?  
**Suzuka:** What is it?  
**Yume:** I feel like, there's someone in here I've seen before.  
**Suzuka:** Well now. For you to remember someone, even slightly, they must be somewhat capable.  
**Suzuka:** Yume, that's a toji that you once cut down.  
**Yume:** Ah... They're in here too, huh.  
**Yukari:** That was all under Tagitsuhime's influence. Does it still bother you?  
**Yume:** ...It's the truth though, that I'm the one who attacked Mokusa.  
**Yukari:** Then, you'll need to prove it with your actions going forward. How the new Tsubakuro has changed from the old one.  
**Yume:** The old me, and the new me... I got it, Yukari-sama\!  
**Yukari:** Good.  
**Yukari:** Satsuki, which of these faction requires our attention?  
**Yomi:** There are several, but... The most important one is the Hitakami faction.  
**Yukari:** The faction headed by the Hitakami Family, the distinguished toji family from Tohoku...  
**Yomi:** Yes. Their position is to reduce harm suffered by toji while suppressing aradama. They have stated they are willing to find positive applications for aradama to make that happen.  
**Suzuka:** Positive applications for aradama... Do you know what exactly they mean?  
**Yomi:** I wasn't able to find that much. However, they appear to be carrying out some experiments utilizing aradama.  
**Yomi:** It seems they've acquired materials on the Myouga toji project as well, so we can assume they are making real advances.  
**Maki:** Myouga toji...  
**Maki:** Did they not join in back then because they determined Tagitsuhime wouldn't reduce toji casualties?  
**Yukari:** They may espouse radical ideals, but they shouldn't have shown any serious movements before now.  
**Yomi:** Recently, the previous head of the family passed away. Her daughter has now inherited her position.  
**Yomi:** The current head of the Hitakami family is... Hitakami Makoto. And, the toji closest to Hitakami Makoto would be...  
**Yomi:** Both Inago Akira and Toribane Yuuki.  
**Maki:** Inago Akira...?  
**Maki:** Yomi. Hasn't this toji come to see you before?  
**Yomi:** ...She has.  
**Yomi:** Hitakami Makoto, Inago Akira, Toribane Yuuki... I come from the same town as the three of them.  
**Suzuka:** Which means... They're from Akita?  
**Yomi:** Yes. I went to the same elementary school as the three of them... And, in particular, Inago Akira's home was in my neighborhood.  
**Kaoru:** Special Raid Unit, Mashiko Kaoru, coming in-.  
**Sayaka:** Itomi Sayaka, entering.  
**Kaoru:** Is Origami Yukari here? I brought the report from our last mission.  
**Yukari:** Did something happen?  
**Kaoru:** Asakura Mihono got overwhelmed by the power of Kashuu Kiyomitsu and went on a rampage. What's the deal with that okatana?  
**Maki:** Mashiko Kaoru, watch your tone when talking to Yukari-sama...  
**Yukari:** It's fine, Shidou.  
**Maki:** ...Yes ma'am.  
**Yukari:** What happened with Asakura Mihono?  
**Kaoru:** Me and Sayaka managed to stop her. But, it was pretty close.  
**Yume:** Even with you and Sayaka-chan, she came pretty close to beating you\!\?  
**Sayaka:** Mm. Mihono was strong.  
**Yume:** She went on a rampage, hm... Yukari-sama\! I want to try fighting that onee-san when she's rampaging\!  
**Yukari:** You can't.  
**Yukari:** ...You two did well. Was there anything else that happened?  
**Kaoru:** A toji who was there said something that got my attention. That, she knew what was happening to Mihono.  
**Suzuka:** That is a rather concerning statement. ...What was this toji's name? We'll make preparations to summon her here straight away.  
**Kaoru:** Inago Akira.  
**Suzuka:** ...\! The toji from the Hitakami faction...  
**Maki:** There's a bad pattern forming here...  
**Yukari:** ...Thank you for your efforts.  
**Kaoru:** Then, I made my report and all. We're leaving, Sayaka.  
**Sayaka:** Okay.  
**Suzuka:** Yukari-sama, should we question her?  
**Yukari:** ...Let her go for now.  
**Suzuka:** Understood.  
**Yukari:** All of you, please continue the investigation.  
**Maki:** Yes ma'am\!  
**Yomi:** ............  
**Yomi:** ...Akira.  

## 3: No Matter How Many Times I Repeat It
**Yomi:** Shidou-san, do you have a moment?  
**Maki:** What do you need, Yomi?  
**Yomi:** During our lunch break, I'm going to step out for a while. I should be back in an hour.  
**Maki:** It's up to you how you spend your breaks... But, you don't often ask things like that.  
**Yomi:** Now is a good time for me to visit.  
**Maki:** Do you mind if I ask where you're going?  
**Yomi:** ...The hospital.  
**Yomi:** Excuse me.  
**Yukina:** ...Come in.  
**Yomi:** ...How is your health?  
**Yukina:** Fine.  
**Yomi:** I brought flowers and fruits.  
**Yukina:** Oh.  
**Yomi:** ......  
**Yomi:** I'll replace the water for the flowers.ã€€  
**Yukina:** ...  
**Yomi:** ...  
**Yukina:** ...  
**Yomi:** ...I need to leave soon.  
**Yukina:** Right.  
**Yomi:** ......  
**Yomi:** I'm not sure if you're aware, but I was assigned to the Special Defense Team.  
**Yomi:** I plan to make use of this power there.  
**Yukina:** ...Don't you regret it?  
**Yomi:** I don't.  
**Yomi:** If the same thing were to happen... I would join you again.  
**Yukina:** ...Oh.  
**Yomi:** I'm sorry to have bothered you.  
**Yukina:** ...  
**Yomi:** I'll come again.  
**Yukina:** ...  
**Yukina:** ...Okay.  
**Yomi:** I've returned.  
**Maki:** How's she doing?  
**Yomi:** Her body is recovering properly. But... she seems depressed.  
**Maki:** I see.  
**Yomi:** I'm returning to my assignment.  
**Maki:** ...  
**Maki:** Do you really not want to remove your aradama?  
**Yomi:** I don't.  
**Yomi:** This is the power that she gave to me. With this power... I'll perform my duties.  

## 4: Training\! (1)
**Mihono:** Hello-\!  
**Tsugumi:** Oh?  
**Kofuki:** Yo, Mihocchi. What brings you here today?  
**Mihono:** I came to do a little training\!  
**Kofuki/Tsugumi:** Training?  
**Mihono:** HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Mihono:** Give me the next one, please\!  
**Tsugumi:** Understood. Releasing the next aradama.  
**Aradama:** GUOOOOOOOOOOO\!  
**Mihono:** YAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Mihono:** Next\!  
**Kofuki:** Hey hey, she's pretty fired up. I wasn't sure if she was serious when shesaid you wanted to train, but she's really going at it.  
**Tsugumi:** Are you not going to join her, Shichinosato-san?  
**Kofuki:** She said she wants to train, so if I went in there, I'd get in her way.  
**Tsugumi:** Huh.  
**Kofuki:** ...What.  
**Kofuki:** Mihocchi's going through a lot right now. So I'm letting her have her way a little. You got a problem with that?  
**Tsugumi:** There's no problem at all.  
**Kofuki:** Course not.  
**Mihono:** Next one, please\!  
**Tsugumi:** The next one... Ah.  
**Kofuki:** What's up?  
**Tsugumi:** This is the final set.  
**Kofuki:** Say that sooner\! We're swapping out, Mihocchi\!  
**Tsugumi:** Were you not going to let Asakura-san have her way?  
**Kofuki:** I didn't say I was letting her have everything\! I wanna have fun with some aradama-chan too\!  
**Kofuki:** So anyway, swap out with me already, Mihocchi\!  
**Mihono:** Ehh-\! Just let me go a little longer, Fukki\!  
**Kofuki:** Hell no\! You're gonna get rid of my share\!  
**Tsugumi:** There are a lot in the final set for one person to handle alone. Why don't the two of you do it together?  
**Mihono:** Hear that\! Let's split it, Fukki\!  
**Kofuki:** If we have to... But, you get exactly half, alright\!  
**Mihono:** Sure\!  

## 5: Training\! (2)
**Kofuki:** We had fun, aradama-chan\! Mihocchi\! The last one's going your way\!  
**Mihono:** Okay\!  
**Aradama:** AAAAAAAA\!  
**Mihono:** This is the last one... Urghh.  
**Kofuki:** Mihocchi?  
**Mihono:** U-Urgh...  
**Aradama:** GYAAAAAAAAAA\!  
**Kofuki:** You got a stomachache\!\?  
**Kofuki:** Alright, then just sit tight\!\!  
**Mihono:** Fukki, don't move\!\!  
**Kofuki:** \!\?  
**Mihono:** ...You can't, come over here...\! AAAAAAGGGHHHHHHHHHH\!\!  
**Aradama:** -\!\!  
**Kofuki:** Wha\!\? Mihocchi just swung her okatana, and...\!  
**Tsugumi:** That was quite the empowered strike... It looked to be a high level of hachimanriki.  
**Kofuki:** Who gives a shit about levels and whatever right now\!\? Oi, Mihocchi\! What do you want me to do\!\?  
**Mihono:** It's okay... It's okay... Letting some power out, I think it's calming down...  
**Mihono:** [pant, pant...]  
**Kofuki:** ...Did she get it under control?  
**Tsugumi:** ...It looks like she did.  
**Kofuki:** Mihocchi, can I come over to you now?  
**Mihono:** ...Yeah, it's fine. I'm sorry, for making you worry.  
**Tsugumi:** Have some milk.  
**Mihono:** Thanks a lot. [gulp gulp...] Phew.  
**Tsugumi:** Did it calm you down? It's from Shichinosato-san's special stock, so I can vouch for the taste.  
**Kofuki:** Who said you could go take from that\! ...Well, it's fine this time, I guess.  
**Mihono:** Ahaha. This is pretty tasty.  
**Kofuki:** Right? It's been my new favorite.  
**Kofuki:** ...So, that's that rampage thing, huh? You scared me, when that came out of nowhere.  
**Mihono:** That was one step away from it... I think? Last time I lost consciousness, but I managed to stay awake through it this time...  
**Tsugumi:** I did collect data during it, just in case, but... There was too little data to make anything out...  
**Tsugumi:** The situation was more tense than I expected. Is there any way you could safely reproduce that?  
**Mihono:** I don't... think I could. I don't want it to go rampant that many times anyway...  
**Mihono:** I don't know anything about why it's going rampant... or how I can get Kashuu Kiyomitsu under control in the first place.  
**Kofuki:** ...Can you actually even control that? It... looked pretty bad to me.  
**Mihono:** To be honest... I'm not really sure.  
**Tsugumi:** I'm not sure how possible this is, but... One option is to try exchanging for a different okatana.  
**Mihono:** But... I don't want to do that.  
**Mihono:** Kashuu Kiyomitsu is the okatana I inherited from my mother. I don't want to be scared of it.  
**Kofuki:** Well... I'm not sure I can do much, but, if there's anything I can do to help, tell me, alright?  
**Mihono:** Thanks, Fukki. But, you don't have to worry about me that much.  
**Mihono:** (...I wasn't even trying to use Kiyomitsu's power there. Does that mean I'm running out of time?)  
**Mihono:** (Hitakami Makoto-san... Maybe I will go talk to her.)  
**Kofuki:** Your phone's ringing, Mihocchi.  
**Mihono:** Uhh... Oh, my next assignment came in. I have to suppress aradama that appeared in the Tohoku region.  
**Mihono:** Joining in are... Akira-san, and Yuuki.  
**Tsugumi:** Is something wrong?  
**Mihono:** Ah, no, I'm just going with people I know.  

## 6: To Tohoku (1)
**Mihono:** They're supposed to be here... Oh, there they are\! Heyyy\! Akira-san\! Yuuki\!  
**Akita:** Oh, you made it, Mihono.  
**Yuuki:** It's been a while, Mihono-san. Has it gone rampant since then...?  
**Mihono:** Thanks for worrying about me, Yuuki. Yeah, it did a little...  
**Yuuki:** Is that so...  
**Akira:** ...We're all here, so why don't we get going.  
**Yuuki:** It's been such a long time since I rode on a train together with Akira-nee-sama. Ever since you got your license, you've always been on your bike.  
**Akira:** Nn? Ahh, now that you mention it, you're right.  
**Akira:** Well, nothing wrong with taking the train from time to time. Yuuki, Mihono, you want an orange?  
**Yuuki:** I'll have one.  
**Mihono:** Ah, okay... It's cold\!\?  
**Yuuki:** They're refridgerated oranges. ...Mm, it's cold and sweet.  
**Mihono:** Haha, that's for sure.  
**Mihono:** ...Can I ask you something, Akira-san?  
**Akira:** Hmm-? What's up?  
**Mihono:** What you said to me, before... What is it that's happening to me?  
**Akira:** Ahh, it's about that. ...Want another orange?  
**Yuuki:** Ah, I'll take it. Thank you very much, Nee-sama.  
**Mihono:** Akira-san\!  
**Akira:** O-Oi, don't go shouting. The passengers're all looking.  
**Mihono:** You weren't lying to me, were you?  
**Yuuki:** Nee-sama doesn't tell lies, Mihono-san.  
**Mihono:** That's what I believe too, but still\!  
**Akira:** You're panicking, aren't you.  
**Mihono:** I let out a crazy strong hachimanriki... I managed to stop it before I did more than that, but...  
**Akira:** Next time, you might not be so lucky, right.  
**Mihono:** ...Right.  
**Akira:** Sorry bout this. I wanna talk about it, but it's just something someone told me too, and it's a real long story at that.  
**Akira:** But, we should be able to explain the stuff you wanna know, so don't panic over it. We're getting things ready for you.  
**Mihono:** Getting things ready?  
**Akira:** Yeah. So, for now, just kick back and have some cooled oranges.  
**Aradama:** GURURU...  
**Yuuki:** The readings on the spectrum finder have vanished. That aradama looks to be the last of them.  
**Akira:** That's our job done. ...Mihono.  
**Mihono:** ...Y-Yes?  
**Akira:** You know we're with Mokusa, don't you?  
**Mihono:** Yes, I know.  
**Akira:** Our faction's base is right around here. We can have a nice long chat there.  
**Mihono:** It's right around here...?  
**Yuuki:** It's Makoto-onee-sama's family home\! It's so large it might surprise you.  
**Mihono:** Huh-\!  
**Mihono:** -\! Akira-san, Yuuki\! There's something there...  
**???:** GRRRRRR...\!		[All other aradama use katakana for growls. This one alternates between katakana and hiragana.]  
**Mihono:** What is that...? An animal... Or, an aradama...?  
**Akira:** ...\!  
**Akira:** Yuuki. Take Mihono and go on ahead.  
**Yuuki:** Right. Let's go, Mihono-san.  
**Mihono:** Wait\! If that's an aradama, I'll fight it with you\!  
**Akira:** That's not it. This's just one of our screwups. You've gotta clean up your own mistakes.  
**Yuuki:** Mihono-san, we're going\!\!  
**Mihono:** H-Hey, Yuuki\! Don't pull me\!  
**Akira:** Sigh...  
**???:** GURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR\!  
**Akira:** They totally fucked this up. Somebody's going off on their own again not listening to Makocchan.  
**Akira:** You've had your share of misfortune too... I'm gonna have you quiet down for now.  

## 7: To Tohoku (2)
**???:** ...[whimper]...  
**Akira:** ...Sorry.  
**Akira:** Just gonna tie you to this tree while I can... Alright. I'll have somebody come pick you up.  
**Akira:** Damnit, if only Hirona was around. There's hardly anybody we can count on here...  
**Mihono:** Hey, Yuuki\! What was that, back there?  
**Yuuki:** ...  
**Mihono:** Was it an aradama? But, it seemed sort of different...  
**Mihono:** Hey, Yuuki\!  
**Yuuki:** ......  
**Akira:** Oh. I finally caught up to you.  
**Mihono:** Akira-san\! Are you okay?  
**Akira:** Sure, it wasn't a big deal.  
**Mihono:** What was that thing back there?  
**Akira:** You don't have to worry about that now. Either way, I'm sure you'll learn about it soon enough.  
**Mihono:** What do you mean...?  
**Akira:** We should be talking about that "power" of yours first, right? Let's get you to see Makocchan already.  
**Mihono:** ...Yeah.  
**Akira:** This way. Stick with me.  

## 8: Hitakami Makoto (1)
**Akira:** It's here.  
**Mihono:** ...Yuuki told me about it, but it sure is a huge mansion. It's like the Origami house...  
**Akira:** The Hitakamis are an old family, just like the Origamis. They've gotta have a bigass house to match their image.  
**Akira:** Alright, let's go on in. Makocchan's gonna get sick of waiting.  
**Hitakami Makoto:** Thank you for your time, Asakura Mihono-san. I am the head of the Hitakami family, Hitakami Makoto.  
**Mihono:** (So this is Hitakami Makoto-san...)  
**Makoto:** Inago, Toribane. Please leave me alone with Asakura-san.  
**Akira:** Sure.  
**Yuuki:** Very well then.  
**Makoto:** Asakura-san?  
**Mihono:** Y-Yes\!  
**Makoto:** There's no need for you to be so nervous.  
**Makoto:** How informed are you about us... About Mokusa's Hitakami faction?  
**Mihono:** ...I pretty much don't know anything. Is it... bad that I don't know anything...?  
**Makoto:** No, that won't be a problem at all. I'll begin my explanation from there.  
**Makoto:** As the name suggests, the Hitakami faction is led by the Hitakami family-- A faction based here, in the Tohoku region, out of our old home.  
**Makoto:** And our ideology is to make effective use of aradama, for the benefit of toji and society.  
**Mihono:** To use aradama... Do you mean like Myouga toji...?  
**Makoto:** The case involving Myouga toji and Tagitsuhime was an unfortunate incident that brought about many victims...  
**Makoto:** Nevertheless, humans are ever-evolving creatures. Spurred on by that incident, we have been able to make progress.  
**Mihono:** Progress...?  
**Makoto:** Now then, this introduction has gone on rather long, hasn't it.  
**Makoto:** There is something I am able to tell you, in regards to your power.  
**Makoto:** Firstly, let us speak of your family line... Let's speak of the Asakura family.  
**Makoto:** There is a deep connection between the Hitakami and the Asakura. The full nature of which has been passed down through this family.  
**Makoto:** Yet... Before I may explain it to you, there is something I must inquire.  
**Mihono:** What's that?  
**Makoto:** Your resolve.  
**Makoto:** After our conversation has finished, you will know the truth of Kashuu Kiyomitsu.  
**Makoto:** However... Once you know that, you will be unable to return to your former life.  
**Mihono:** -\!\?  
**Makoto:** To have the truth made clear... Do you have the resolve to step over to our side?  
**Mihono:** ......  
**Mihono:** You say resolve, but, I'm not sure. All I know is... I don't want to be afraid of Kiyomitsu.  
**Mihono:** This okatana... It's something I got from my mother; something important to remember her by.  
**Makoto:** You do have a good look in your eyes. Very well.  
**Makoto:** Then, there is one last thing I will check for myself. Whether you truly have the disposition for it. Whether... you are a descendant of Atago.  
**Mihono:** Atago...?  
**Makoto:** Please come with me.  
**Makoto:** This place should do well.  
**Makoto:** I am now going to wield my okatana with the intent of killing you. Please fight back earnestly.  
**Mihono:** Eh? Killing me... What...\!\?  
**Mihono:** ...\!\?  
**Makoto:** If you do not fight, you will die.  

## 9: Hitakami Makoto (2)
**Makoto:** HAA-\!\!  
**Mihono:** Gh\!\!  
**Mihono:** (She's strong\! There's a toji this strong here\!\?)  
**Mihono:** If you're this strong, why weren't you in the tournament? You, and Akira-san too... You would have definitely placed high\!  
**Makoto:** Our power isn't for fighting in tournaments. It's for protecting the people. Is that not the truth, Asakura Mihono-san?  
**Mihono:** (I just thought it was natural to join in the tournament and win there...)  
**Mihono:** (But, Hitakami-san is... Ughh\!\?)  
**Mihono:** ...\! Kashuu Kiyomitsu's......\! Get away from me...\!  
**Akira:** Makocchan\! Did Mihono lose control\!\?  
**Yuuki:** Were you unhurt, Makoto-nee-sama\!  
**Makoto:** I'm entirely fine. I must have made you worry, Akira-chan, Yuuki-chan.  
**Makoto:** Though, it was worth taking the risk.  
**Mihono:** AGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHH\!\!  
**Makoto:** I've confirmed that power for myself. She's just the collaborator we need.  
**Other:** Investigation Without Progress  
**Mirja:** Musumi Kiyoka, were there any accounts of Kashuu Kiyomitsu or the Asakura family, in the records you have?  
**Kiyoka:** There's nothing in here. What about in yours, Mirja-san?  
**Mirja:** It's the same. There's no results.  
**Kiyoka:** Really...  
**Kiyoka:** I want to hurry and find some information that will give Hono-chan peace of mind...  
**Mirja:** ...Yes. Though, I can't understand it.  
**Kiyoka:** Eh?  
**Mirja:** There isn't a single account of any okatana, not just Kashuu Kiyomitsu, running rampant.  
**Kiyoka:** There isn't, is there...  
**Kiyoka:** But, it seems like, if someone lost control of an okatana's power, there would definitely be records of it...  
**Mirja:** Did someone conceal them, or, was this the first case of an okatana's power going rampant...  
**Mirja:** (But, if that were the case, it contradicts Inago Akira... Her statement that Hitakami Makoto knows the phenomenon happening to Asakura Mihono.)  
**Mirja:** (Hitakami Makoto... The Hitakami faction...)  
**Mirja:** Time is precious. Let's push on, Musumi Kiyoka.  
**Kiyoka:** Right\!
