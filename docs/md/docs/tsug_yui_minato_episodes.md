## [Bride - Tsugumi: Start]: Undercover Investigation (Tsugumi's Case)
**Tsugumi:** Shichinosato-san, we have a mission.  
**Kofuki:** Where's the aradama-chan at\!\? I'll take care of all of 'em\!\!  
**Tsugumi:** Yes, I can tell you're excited.  
**Tsugumi:** By the way, this mission will require you to wear a wedding dress.  
**Kofuki:** Alright\! Leave it to... Huh? A wedding dress\!\?  
**Tsugumi:** This is one of those so-called undercover investigations. Shichinosato-san will act as a bride to lure out aradama.  
**Tsugumi:** You get to have all the aradama to yourself, so this is truly the perfect assignment for you.  
**Kofuki:** ...Not doing it.  
**Tsugumi:** Hm? What was that?  
**Kofuki:** Hell no I'm not doing it\! Like I'd wear something all loose and frilly like that\! You do it\!  
**Tsugumi:** People have different things they're suited for, so the person who's most suited should wear it.  
**Kofuki:** Huhh? I'm telling you, it'd look bad on me\!  
**Tsugumi:** No no, not at all-. It would look far better on you than me.  
**Tsugumi:** Because you are cute, Shichinosato-san.  
**Kofuki:** ...  
**Tsugumi:** ...As I thought, my flattery sounded forced. Well, it's not as if I don't think you're cute, you know?  
**Kofuki:** Still, you seriously think a wedding dress is the kind of thing I should wear?  
**Tsugumi:** Yes... Or, don't you think you might be unexpectedly suited for it?  
**Kofuki:** Quit just saying that\!  
**Tsugumi:** We'll never come to an agreement like this... There's no helping it. Should we decide this with a competition?  
**Kofuki:** Fine by me? It'll be whoever takes out the most aradama-chan. Loser gets the wedding dress.  
**Tsugumi:** Out of the question. I would have an overwhelming disadvantage in that. Let's decide this fairly.  
**Kofuki:** Like how?  
**Tsugumi:** In speed-eating. I have lots of pre-made food here.  
**Kofuki:** What part of that's fair\!\? You trying to kill me\!\?  
**Tsugumi:** I'm well aware that no one besides myself has a taste for my cooking... Even if I refuse to accept it.  
**Tsugumi:** Though, that alone shows how serious I am here.  
**Kofuki:** You're real freaky, y'know... If you want to do this fair and square, why don't we just do rock paper scissors?  
**Tsugumi:** That sounds reasonable. No hard feelings then?  
**Kofuki:** I know. How many rounds are we doing?  
**Tsugumi:** Let's do just one. Now, ready...  
**Tsugumi/Kofuki:** Rock paper scissors shoot\!  

## [Bride - Tsugumi: End]: I Hope You Remember This...
**Chapel Staff:** The... undercover investigation?  
**Kofuki:** Yeah, so get a wedding dress for her, and make sure it's the cutest one you've got\!  
**Chapel Staff:** You'd like a cute wedding dress...?  
**Tsugumi:** No, please get me an ordinary one.  
**Kofuki:** No way; this is a big opportunity, right? It'd be way better to wear something she normally wouldn't.  
**Tsugumi:** Shichinosato-san\!\?  
**Kofuki:** You know, like, all frilly and stuff, and one that shows a lot of leg too\!  
**Tsugumi:** Th-They wouldn't have a wedding dress like that...  
**Chapel Staff:** Frills... Legs... Ah, right, we do have one like that.  
**Tsugumi:** They do\!\?  
**Kofuki:** Cool, then get it for us\!  
**Tsugumi:** ......  
**Kofuki:** Ahahahahahahaha\!\!  
**Tsugumi:** ......  
**Kofuki:** That's just perfect on you\! I mean, don't you think you look way too good in it\!\!  
**Tsugumi:** ...Hearing you laugh while you say that doesn't make me any happier.  
**Kofuki:** Ahaha, my bad. But hey, you really do look good.  
**Tsugumi:** ...Please don't try to sound serious either.  
**Kofuki:** Huh? If it's no good if I'm laughing and no good if I'm not, then what do you want?  
**Tsugumi:** ...Whichever way you compliment me, it's embarrassing. I don't normally wear things like this...  
**Kofuki:** That's what makes it funny, y'know.  
**Tsugumi:** And that's why, telling me you find it funny is... No, I suppose that's just how you are.  
**Tsugumi:** Come on, let's begin the undercover investigation.  
**Kofuki:** ...That skirt's even shorter than I thought. If you fought in that... They'd show, right?  
**Tsugumi:** -\!\?  
**Tsugumi:** Shichinosato-san...  
**Kofuki:** I'm just joking; you don't have to get all mad-.  
**Tsugumi:** Even I have things that embarrass me.  
**Kofuki:** Hey, if you're not gonna be fighting, I'll take 'em all on.  
**Tsugumi:** That doesn't resolve anything, does it-.  
**Tsugumi:** Remember this, will you? Since you'll be the one wearing these kind of clothes next, Shichinosato-san...

## [Journey to the West - Yui: Start]: Yui's Scheme
**Yui:** .........So that's what I was thinking...  
**Tsugumi:** I see.  
**Yui:** How about it?  
**Tsugumi:** You've come up with something intriguing, Yamashiro-san. However...  
**Yui:** It'd be kind of difficult, wouldn't it?  
**Tsugumi:** Hmmm...  
**Yui:** ...  
**Tsugumi:** ...  
**Tsugumi:** ......Let's give it a try.  
**Yui:** You mean it\!\?  
**Tsugumi:** I should be able to get some interesting data out of it.  
**Chie:** Journey to the West in VR?  
**Tsugumi:** That's right.  
**Tsugumi:** Though, as this is to collect data to improve the variation of future VR training, there will be no enemies.  
**Kofuki:** Huh\!\? There's not gonna be any aradama-chan\!\? Then count me out\!  
**Kofuki:** I'm not into this stuff.  
**Tsugumi:** I thought you would say that, Shichinosato-san. What will the rest of you do?  
**Mirja:** I'll have to decline as well. I have plans after this.  
**Tsugumi:** Understood.  
**Chie:** If Mirja won't be joining in, then I'll stay with you.  
**Mihono:** Since Chii-nee's doing it, I'll do it too-\!  
**Yui:** ...  
**Kiyoka:** ...?  
**Kiyoka:** What are you going to do, Yui-chan?  
**Tsugumi:** Yamashiro-san has said she'll be participating.  
**Kiyoka:** Oh, really...  
**Kiyoka:** (Why is Yui-chan the only one who was already part of this...?\)  
**Kiyoka:** I think... I won't be joining in this time. Tsugumi-san, I'm curious what it is you do while we're in VR, so could I stay here and watch?  
**Yui:** ...  
**Tsugumi:** ...Understood. Please stay here and support me, Musumi-san.  
**Kiyoka:** ...Okay.  
**Tsugumi:** Then, the three participants will be Setouchi-san, Asakura-san, and Yamashiro-san.  
**Tsugumi:** I appreciate your assistance.  
**Chie:** Alright, let's get ready, Mihono-chan.  
**Mihono:** Sure\!  
**Yui:** Guhehehehehe.  

## [Journey to the West - Yui: End]: The Scheme's Outcome
**Mihono:** She said she was getting data for the future... But this is the same as usual VR, huh, Chii-nee.  
**Chie:** That's true... Tsugumi-chan, what exactly should we be doing?  
**Tsugumi:** Today, we'll be testing undressing.  
Several hours ago.

  
**Tsugumi:** You want to know if you can take off clothing in VR?  
**Yui:** Yes\!  
**Yui:** I mean, you don't really have to take them off, but is it possible to tear up clothes when you take damage?  
**Tsugumi:** ...  
**Yui:** I-It's not like I'm thinking up anything indecent though\!\?  
**Yui:** It's just, it's easy to tell when you're taking damage when your clothes get ripped up, so I'm sure it'd help us focus on training more... Or something.  
**Tsugumi:** I see; you want to see the bare skin of the toji you're training with.  
**Yui:** Well, if I'm being honest, yeah.  
**Yui:** But, isn't it a good idea? I think it might be pretty interesting myself...  
**Tsugumi:** We've implemented the function to remove your clothing, so please try taking off your clothes and entering that lake.  
**Tsugumi:** Ahh, even if you take off your outerwear, you won't be naked, so don't mind that.  
**Chie:** Understood. I'll give it a go.  
**Mihono:** Wait for me, Chii-nee\! I'm going too\!  
**Yui:** Ah, I'll just, go in later, okay-?  
**Yui:** ..................Alright\!  
**Yui:** [pant pant pant pant]\! In my hands, I've got Chie-san's clothes\!  
**Yui:** I never thought this plan would go so smoothly...\!  
**Yui:** This is what Chie-san's clothes feel like... Like grabbing onto thin air... What about the smell...\!  
**Yui:** There's no smell\!\!  
**Yui:** What's going on here, Tsugumi-san\!\?  
**Tsugumi:** Even VR has its limits. We can't reproduce the sense of touch and smell.  
**Yui:** The limits of science...\!  
**Kiyoka:** ...You really were thinking up something weird.  
**Yui:** Tsugumi-san\! We need to reproduce the sense of smell next\!  
**Tsugumi:** For that, we'd need to acquire a sample of Setouchi-san's natural body odor.  
**Yui:** Chie-san\! Let me get a sample of your body odor\!  
**Chie:** Yui-chan, I'm giving you a lecture after this is over, okay?  
**Yui:** I'll take the lecture, so just let me sample it\!\!  
**Chie:** That's a no.

## [Mahouka - Minato: Start]: Three Lost People
**Honoka:** Heeeey\! Kanami-? Mihono-?  
**Honoka:** ............  
**Honoka:** Nnnn, they're not answering, Shizuku.  
**Shizuku:** Yep. There's no mistaking it.  
**Shizuku:** We're lost.  
**Honoka:** Of course we are... Sigh. And just when they were finally able to take us out sightseeing...  
**Shizuku:** We probably weren't separated that far from them. We should meet up again soon.  
**Honoka:** Yeah, you're right... Okay\! Let's look for them\!  
**???:** Sorry, I couldn't help but overhear you. You're lost, right?  
**???:** If it's alright, want me to help you look?  
**Honoka:** Are you sure? Umm, you're...?  
**Shizuku:** Who are you?  
**Minato:** Me?  
**Minato:** Actually, I'm lost too. I came here with two friends of mine, but somehow I got stuck on my own.  
**Honoka:** Oh, I see. Since you have an okatana, you must be a toji... Wait? Isn't that okatana...?  
**Minato:** What, Chidori?  
**Shizuku:** Someone we know has the same okatana.  
**Minato:** Someone you know...?  
**Minato:** You sure you're not mixing it up? Chidori's my okatana.  
**Honoka:** Really? But, maybe there's another one of that okatana...  
**Minato:** There isn't one.  
**Honoka:** Huh?  
**Shizuku:** Honoka. We must just be just mistaken.  
**Honoka:** ...That's probably it, Shizuku.  
**Minato:** ...Hey, what's this girl like? The one you think has Chidori.  
**Honoka:** Umm... She's bright and cheery... Ah, she kind of feels a bit like you.  
**Minato:** Hmm...  
**Minato:** Alright. In that case, like I said before, I'll help you look for them. I want to meet this girl too.  
**Shizuku:** You sure?  
**Minato:** Sure thing\!  
**Honoka:** But, you're lost too, aren't you?  
**Minato:** I'll be fine. I figure I'll see my friends soon enough, and we might run into them when we're looking for your friends too.  
**Honoka:** I got it. Then, let's search together\!  

## [Mahouka - Minato: End]: Ideal Dream
**Minato:** Hmmm, we aren't finding anybody.  
**Honoka:** You're not wrong...  
**Honoka:** We've been looking for a while now, but, where could they have gone...  
**Shizuku:** Honoka.  
**Honoka:** What is it, Shizuku?  
**Shizuku:** The koi are swimming up. Do you think they want food?  
**Honoka:** What do koi eat, anyway?  
**Minato:** Koi are omnivores, so they'll eat anything.  
**Minato:** ...By the way, I've never seen your uniforms before. Where's it from?  
**Minato:** It's not a school from around here, right?  
**Shizuku:** It's the National Magic University Affiliated First High School.  
**Honoka:** Sh-Shizuku\!\? Was it really alright telling her?  
**Shizuku:** We already told Mihono and the others, so why bother now.  
**Honoka:** Ah... You have a point.  
**Minato:** ...Magic?  
**Honoka:** Yes, though you might not believe us...  
**Minato:** ...Well yeah, I'm honestly not sure I believe you.  
**Shizuku:** But, it's true. This world is a dream, and Honoka and I come from a different world.  
**Minato:** ...A dream?  
**Shizuku:** That's right.  
**Minato:** A dream... Wait, but... Then, is that what's going on?  
**Honoka:** Is what...?  
**Minato:** You said you knew somebody who has Chidori, right?  
**Honoka:** Ah, yes.  
**Minato:** Then, maybe that's the real one.  
**Honoka:** What do you mean by that...?  
**Minato:** I'm saying, I'm pretty sure mine's just a dream.  
**Shizuku:** What are you saying, all of a sudden?  
**???:** Minato-senpai\! Where are you-?  
**Minato:** Ah, looks like I found a friend of mine. Then, seeya.  
**Minato:** I think you'll definitely run into yours soon too.  
**Honoka:** Um, what was your name...  
**Honoka:** ...She's already gone.  
**Mihono:** Honoka-saaan\! Shizuku-saaan\!  
**Honoka:** Ah.  
**Kanami:** Thank goodness, we finally found you\! We were looking all over for you two\!  
**Honoka/Shizuku:** ......  
**Mihono:** What's wrong?  
**Shizuku:** Kanami, tell me your okatana's name.  
**Kanami:** Uh, it's Chidori...?  
**Honoka/Shizuku:** ......  
**Honoka:** Shizuku, that means...  
**Shizuku:** Yep. We might have seen a ghost.
