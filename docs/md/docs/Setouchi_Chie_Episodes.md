## 1: Effective Applications of the Resource Known as Nene
In the research lab of Osafune Girls' Academy...

  
**Watanabe Emily:** By the way, Cherry, there's something I want you to do for me.  
**Chie:** Is that a new nickname? Cherry...  
**Emily:** Chie, Cherry, it's all the same, isn't it?  
**Emily:** Ahh, I almost forgot. Today's request is about that thing handed down through the Mashiko family. You know.  
**Chie:** Thing? You mean Nene? He's always hanging around Mashiko-san. What do you want with him?  
**Emily:** Mm, first, take a look at this recording. 3... 2... 1... Begin playback\!  
**Emily:** Well? How'd you like my camerawork?  
**Chie:** I already know the answer, but... Are you always doing this stuff?  
**Chie:** Filming the Special Ritual Squad like that is already breaking regulations, but... You're really bothering them by getting in their way to film while they're trying to actually work...  
**Emily:** ...Ahem. Now then, take a look at this part again. Mashiko Kaoru-san's okatana, Nenekirimaru, goes flying through the air.  
**Chie:** She threw it, didn't she?  
**Chie:** I'm more interested in why Mashiko-san was just standing around doing nothing in the middle of a mission, actually.  
**Emily:** More importantly, take a closer look at this analysis with a slow motion camera. Here you can see Nene pulling it along.  
**Emily:** It's not necessarily in the field my research team is covering, but... For an aradama to make an okatana fly like that... Don't you see the potential here?  
**Emily:** If we could reproduce the effects by lining an okatana's mountings with noro... No, if we could reproduce Nene itself through cloning perhaps, more toji would be able to make use of this flying okatana technique.  
**Emily:** Now this is where you come in, Cherry. I need you to go out and capture this "Nene"...  
**Chie:** Emily?  
**Emily:** Of course, I will pay you for this...  
*Chie gives Emily a noogie*

  
**Chie:** Stop talking. There's no way I'd help you with something as horrible as capturing Mashiko-san's important partner\!  
**Emily:** Ow ow\! Grinding my forehead like that is off limits\! Really\! You're always so kind to your juniors, Cherry\! Why won't you be my onee-san too\!  
**Chie:** ...We're in the same grade, you know. You're a little old for that.  
**Emily:** Now that you mention it\!  

## 2: The Girl Who Was a Crybaby
**Chie:** It's been a while, Yoshizumi-san.  
**Asakura Yoshizumi:** Oh, Chie-san. You don't have to be so formal. I don't mind if you call me Grandpa like you used to.  
**Chie:** Then, Grandpa Asakura... It really does feel more natural. You should go back to calling me Chie-chan too.  
**Yoshizumi:** I see, so you've been working as a toji at Osafune. Does that mean you've grown out of being "Crybaby Chii-chan"?  
**Chie:** Please don't bring that up. That was a long time ago...  
**Chie:** ......  
**Yoshizumi:** Hm? What's wrong?  
**Chie:** Maybe I haven't grown out of it. All I ever do is find things to cry about. I keep making new regrets.  
**Chie:** When we were kids, Mihono-chan went to stop some older boys from picking on me, and she ended up getting hurt...  
**Chie:** Even at Minoseki, it's thanks to me that she ended up fighting her friend... And it's all my fault she got wrapped up in this to begin with...  
**Chie:** ...I'm sorry, Grandpa. I feel like... I have to apologize. It's all because of me that Mihono-chan is in this mess...  
**Yoshizumi:** ...That's not true. Don't worry, Mihono got into this of her own accord. I have no doubt she would have gotten into trouble all on her own.  
**Chie:** You don't know the full story\! Mihono-chan did nothing wrong... She did the right thing...  
**Chie:** I promised back then... That I'd become a better onee-chan for her, but...  
**Yoshizumi:** ...Hmm. I might not know all that happened, but... I think you've become a bit too much of a perfectionist.  
**Chie:** ......  
**Yoshizumi:** Listen here.  
**Yoshizumi:** There's nothing wrong with striving to be perfect. But people don't always expect the best from others. It might sound cruel, but that's normal.  
**Yoshizumi:** Don't put so much pressure on yourself. If you want to be an onee-chan to her, then you should enjoy yourself while you're doing it.  
**Yoshizumi:** I don't know what goes through her head, but Mihono... I know that, right now, being by your side makes her very happy.  
**Yoshizumi:** So you should be happier about it too\!  
**Chie:** Grandpa...  

## 3: The Secret Behind the Ribbon
**Kiyoka:** By the way, I've been thinking this for a while, but that ribbon of yours is so fashionable, Setouchi-san.  
**Chie:** The one I tie my hair back with?  
**Kiyoka:** Yes, it's very stylish. I couldn't help but notice it.  
**Chie:** As it turns out, Mihono-chan gave this to me.  
**Kiyoka:** Asakura-san did?  
**Chie:** Yes. It was a gift from Mihono-chan, when we were split up after I moved away from Gifu to Okayama.  
**Kiyoka:** Really? That's so cute; giving a ribbon as a parting gift. I wonder what feelings she wanted you to carry with it?  
**Chie:** Fufu. Actually, this ribbon was cut in two. Mihono-chan kept the other half. She wanted it to feel like, even if we were apart, we'd always be together.  
**Chie:** That's what she promised me, but...  
**Ellen:** Oh\! You two\! More aradama showed up\! Let's get in formation\!  
**Kiyoka/Chie:** \!\!  
**Chie:** ...That seems like the last of them.  
**Kiyoka:** Y-Yes. I hope so. So, about what you were saying before... Do you think Mihono-san still remembers that ribbon?  
**Chie:** I'm not sure? It wouldn't surprise me if she forgot.  
**Mihono:** Eh? What's up? You're talking about Chii-nee's ribbon? Sure I remember\!  
**Chie:** \!\?  
**Mihono:** Huh? Well of course I would; it's really important to me. I tied it to my bed back at the dorms, like a protection charm.  
**Mihono:** We suddenly got pulled into this investigation team though, so I didn't have a chance to bring it with me.  
**Mihono:** Wait, you mean you didn't see it when you were in my room, Chii-nee?  
**Chie:** O-Oh, I, uh... Sorry, I must not have noticed\~\. Maybe I was just distracted by how cute your sleeping face looked, Mihono-chan?  

## 4: Sing\! My Fellow Toji
**Mihono:** Since everyone's got nothing better to do, let's start the karaoke tournament\~\!  
**Chie:** It's not really a tournament, you know.  
**Sasano Miyako:** And some of us do have better things to do.  
**Miyako:** Still, I didn't think the school had a karaoke room. What is this place?  
**Chie:** They use this for school festivals. They let us rent out the latest equipment too.  
**Kiyoka:** This sounds like fun. We haven't done anything like karaoke since we formed the investigation team.  
**Kofuki:** ...Tch.  
**Mihono:** Fukki's not getting into it... I wish Mirja-san could have joined us too.  
**Kiyoka:** Being the captain keeps her busy. Um, here, you're up first, Hono-chan.  
**Mihono:** I'm on it\!  
**Mihono:** Everyone's such good singers\~\. Miyako-san knows so many western songs, Kiyoka did all those trendy songs, and Fukki... Well, you just kept singing the same one over and over again. Four whole times.  
**Kofuki:** It's the only one I know\! You got a problem with that\!\?  
**Kiyoka:** That only leaves Chie-san. From the start, all she's been doing is picking out songs for Hono-chan. Does she not plan on singing?  
**Mihono:** Ah... You're right... I didn't get to choose a single song\! Everyone else did it, so you sing too, Chii-nee\!  
**Chie:** Eh? Well, I'm... You know?  
**Kiyoka:** Chie-san, I want to hear you sing too\! Please sing for us\!  
**Chie:** Really? Well, if you're all asking...  
**Mihono:** Come to think of it, I've got no clue what kind of music Chii-nee is into...  
**Miyako:** Well, you'll find out soon enough. A pro like her's about to put us all to shame.  
**Kiyoka:** A pro\!\? Is she going to sing a really adult love song or something?  
**Mihono:** Or maybe she'll sing jazz\!  
**Kiyoka:** Or something unexpected, like death metal... Ah... Chie-san took out her smart phone.  
**Kiyoka:** She must already have a karaoke app. She seems really used to this.  
**Kiyoka:** ...\!\? This prelude\!  
**Chie:** THE WOOOMAN\~\~ BY THE WAVES\~\~  
**Kiyoka/Mihono:** Classical enka\~\!  

## 5: Onee-chan Dismissal\! Dismissed\!
**Mihono:** Take this\! Kamui\!  
**Aradama:** GYAAAAAAA\!  
**Chie:** Th-Thank you, Mihono-chan. You saved me...  
**Kiyoka:** Setouchi-san\! Are you okay\!\?  
**Chie:** I'm fine... I hadn't even noticed one sneaking up behind us... Thank you so much, you two.  
**Mihono:** You're the one who's always saving us, Chii-nee. But today we got to pay you back, right, Kiyoka\!  
**Kiyoka:** Ah, yes. I, um... I was useful too, wasn't I?  
**Chie:** Mmhm, you're so strong, Kiyoka-chan. But I feel so safe with Mihono-chan watching over me. It's like you don't need my support anymore.  
**Mihono:** Really\!\? We can take care of ourselves now\! It's official\!  
**Kiyoka:** Th-That's troubling though... At the very least, if I could still stay in the back...  
**Chie:** Okay, okay, you two have outgrown your onee-san\~\. Now let's clean things up here. Mihono-chan, you were scratched, so take care of that.  
**Mihono:** Fukki-\! Give me a bandage\! A bandage\!  
**Kofuki:** Huh\!\? Use one of your own\!  
**Kiyoka:** Sorry, I used up the last of ours...  
**Kofuki:** Tch, then take whatever...  
**Mihono:** Thanks\!  
**Chie:** (They've really grown...)  
**Mirja:** What's the matter, Setouchi Chie-san?  
**Chie:** It's nothing...  
**Chie:** No, it's bothering me. I thought I'd always be their onee-chan, but look at them now...  
**Chie:** If anything, they're the ones protecting me now.  
**Chie:** It was pretty arrogant of me to think I'd always have to look after them, wasn't it...  
**Mirja:** I see...  
**Kiyoka:** Ah\! I found a bandage\!  
**Mihono:** Nice, Kiyoka\! High five\! ...Ah\!\! The bandage\!  
**Kiyoka:** It's rolling down the hill\!  
**Mihono:** Wait up, bandage--\!\!  
**Kiyoka:** Ahh, stop, Hono-chan\! That's dangerous\! Be careful not to lose your footing\!  
*Mihono falls down the hill*

  
**Mirja:** .....  
**Chie:** ......  
**Mirja:** ...It seems your duties as an onee-san aren't over yet.  
**Chie:** Fufu... I guess not\~\.

## [Swimsuit 19: Start]: Shirie
**Kofuki:** You've got a fat ass too, huh, Chichie.  
**Chie:** ......  
**Chie:** I'm sorry, Kofuki-chan. I didn't quite hear you just now.  
**Chie:** Do you think you could say that again?  
**Kofuki:** I said your ass is fat too, Chichie.  
**Kofuki:** Is that what they call childbearing hips? What'd you eat to get it that fat, Shirie? 	[Much like chichi means tits, shiri means ass]  
**Chie:** Kofuki-chan\!\!  
**Kofuki:** What're you getting mad for\!\? I was just making a simple observation\!\!  
**Chie:** This is one of those things you should keep to yourself\!  
**Chie:** I can't believe you. Can we please have a good time here without you saying things like that?  
**Kofuki:** I'm having plenty of a good time though.  
**Kofuki:** Anyway, you should try taking it easy, Chichie. Since we came to the pool and all.  
**Kofuki:** You've been having a hard time, right?  
**Chie:** Kofuki-chan... Thank you.  
**Chie:** I didn't think you would be so concerned about me...  
**Kofuki:** Yeah, yeah, dragging that fat ass around must be a lot of work.  
**Chie:** ...Oh. Fufu, so that's what you meant, hmm?  
**Chie:** And here your onee-san was proud of you for a moment.  
**Kofuki:** Oh shit, she's seriously pissed\! I'm outta here\!\!  
**Chie:** Ah, hold it right there\!  
**Chie:** Honestly, she's so quick to run away...  
**Chie:** ...Does it really look that fat?  
**Chie:** Good grief, all this anger's left me feeling worn out. I'll rest a little.  
**Kofuki:** That was close... If she'd have caught me, I'd get a whole lecture.  
**Kofuki:** I'm not about to stand around while she chews me out in this place.  
**Kofuki:** And I mean, her ass is fat.  
**Kofuki:** Ah... I got it...\!  
**Kofuki:** Heheh\!  
**Chie:** There we go.  
**Chie:** ...Hmm? I felt something strange at my waist...  

## [Swimsuit 19: End]: Don't Make Others Angry
**Kofuki:** Crap, she noticed\!  
**Chie:** ......Kofuki-chan?  
**Chie:** What are you doing there?  
**Kofuki:** I was just, uh, interested in how these type of swimsuits work.  
**Chie:** ...Is there anything else you'd like to say?  
**Kofuki:** Your ass is just as fat as I thought\!  
**Chie:** That's more like you. They'll make fitting last words.  
**Kofuki:** O-Oi, what's that supposed to mean, Chichie? My last...  
**Chie:** Kofuki-chan? I hope you're prepared for this.  
**Kofuki:** Wha-, hang on\! It's just a cute little prank, right\!\?  
**Kofuki:** Besides, it's not like you aren't wearing anything under the pareo, so you don't have to freak out even if it comes off\!  
**Chie:** ...Sohayanotsuruki.  
**Kofuki:** Hey, you, wait, okatana are off limits, okay\!\? Where'd you even pull that from\!\?  
**Chie:** A toji must always keep their okatana in arms reach, isn't that right?  
**Kofuki:** So where were you keeping it\!\?  
**Kofuki:** Oi... C-Cut it out\!  
**Kofuki:** GYAA----\!\!  
**Chie:** Really now, isn't it time you learned there are some lines even friends don't cross? It's important to know right from wrong, Kofuki-chan.  
**Kofuki:** ...I'm sorry.  
**Chie:** And also, my butt isn't big. It's normal sized.  
**Kofuki:** Nah, it's pretty...  
**Chie:** Nn?  
**Kofuki:** ...I'm sorry.  
**Chie:** Have you learned your lesson?  
**Kofuki:** Sigh... I shouldn't have done that, okay...  
**Kofuki:** Ughh...  
**Kofuki:** (I'll just stick to messing with her tits from now on...)

**[Misogi - Chie:** Start] The Torn Ribbon  
**Aradama:** KEEEEEEEEE\!  
**Chie:** HAAAAAA\!  
**Mihono:** Alriiight\! There's no more aradama around, so I think we're probably done here now\!  
**Chie:** ...Phew. Good work, everyone.  
**Kiyoka:** No, please be on your guard\! There's a reading on the spectrum finder\!  
**Aradama:** KUEEEEEEEE\!  
**Chie:** Kyah\!\?  
**Kofuki:** I'm taking that aradama-chan\!  
**Mirja:** ...Musumi Kiyoka, are there any more readings on your spectrum finder?  
**Kiyoka:** ...They're all gone. That was honest to goodness the last of them this time.  
**Mihono:** Uu\~, because I went and said that... Are you okay, Chii-nee?  
**Chie:** It seems I was just a little more careless than I should have been.  
**Kofuki:** ...Nn? Chichie, you sure about that?  
**Chie:** Kofuki-chan?  
**Kofuki:** That's not what I mean\! It's just, you're acting kinda different than usual...  
**Kiyoka:** ...Ah\! Your ribbon\! Chie-san's ribbon is torn\!  
**Chie:** ...Sigh.  
**Mirja:** Setouchi Chie's usual spirit is gone... Was it that much of a shock to her?  
**Kofuki:** Guess even Chichie can get all depressed like that.  
**Kiyoka:** It's worrying... Hono-chan, have you ever seen Chie-san like that before?  
**Mihono:** Kind of. Way back when, Chii-nee used to cry really easy, and she'd get called crybaby Chii-chan.  
**Kiyoka/Kofuki:** Crybaby Chii-chan\!\?  
**Chie:** Just now, I heard the word "crybaby"... Mihono-chan?  
**Mihono:** H-Huh? Was that something I wasn't supposed to tell anyone?  
**Kofuki:** Yo\! Crybaby Chii-chan\!  
**Chie:** ...Don't you think you're getting ahead of yourself?  
**Kofuki:** Yeah, yeah, that's how it should be. Chichie's gotta be mad if anything.  
**Chie:** I can't believe you. I'm feeling fine now, so, this whole... crybaby, thing, just forget about it\! Understand?  
**Kiyoka:** But, still... That ribbon is important to you, isn't it? It's you and Hono-chan's...  
**Chie:** That's right, it's very important to me. But... I can't stay moping around about it forever, can I?  
**Kiyoka:** Then... Let us give you a ribbon, as a present\! To thank you for always looking after us\!  
**Chie:** But, I do have other ribbons too... Sorry.  
**Kiyoka:** Even if you have more, that's still fine\! On the next day we have off, let's go buy one together\!  

## [Misogi - Chie: End]: Growing Treasures
**Kiyoka:** Chie-san, how about this ribbon? I think it would look good on you...  
**Chie:** I do think it's fine, but... Don't you think it's a little too cute for me?  
**Kofuki:** How about this one then? This one's not cute, which is perfect for you.  
**Chie:** I'm not sure I like that last part, but... This is nice too. Though, don't you think it's too flashy?  
**Kofuki:** You think? This's pretty normal.  
**Kiyoka:** I think both of them would suit you fine.  
**Chie:** Um... I suppose that's fine then, but...  
**Kofuki:** If you've got something you're looking for, then just say it. We can look for one of those.  
**Chie:** It's not exactly something I'm looking for, but... I'm so used to wearing my usual ribbon that it's embarrassing trying something else...  
**Kiyoka:** But that's such a waste\! Since we're here, let's try to get you a new ribbon\!  
**Chie:** F-Fine then. I'll... give it a try.  
**Kofuki:** Still, I wish we had a few more people here to come up with something.  
**Kiyoka:** There's no helping it. Hono-chan had something she had to take care of, and the others are all away on missions.  
**Kofuki:** Well, no use talking about who's not here, I guess. The two of us'll have to come up with something that'll fit Chichie.  
**Chie:** Thank you for coming out with me today, you two.  
**Chie:** But... I'm sorry. In the end, I wound up choosing a ribbon with a design like the one I already had.  
**Kiyoka:** Don't worry about that\! It was fun picking out a ribbon with you, Chie-san\!  
**Kofuki:** I mean, if you say that's what you want, then it's fine, right?  
**Kofuki:** That's what you're most used to, after all.  
**Chie:** Thank you... I'll take good care of it.  
**Chie:** Oh? Who could be stopping by this late?  
**Mihono:** Good, you're still up, Chii-nee\!  
**Chie:** Mihono-chan? Why are you here? I thought you had gone back home today...  
**Mihono:** Yeah, I just got back. So anyway-- Here, I got you a present\!  
**Chie:** ...A ribbon? Don't tell me... When you said you had something to take care of today, you were fixing this...  
**Mihono:** Ah, no, that's not it. Actually, when I first got this ribbon, it came in a set of two.  
**Chie:** ...It did?  
**Mihono:** When you look that surprised about it, it's kinda awkward.  
**Mihono:** And anyway, think about it. If you were going to split the same ribbon between two people, wouldn't you normally just buy two of the same ribbon?  
**Chie:** That's... true, I suppose. But, if you had this, then... Why did we split one ribbon in two back then?  
**Mihono:** I thought, if we did it that way, then you wouldn't forget about me.  
**Chie:** ...Of all things. Even if you hadn't done that, you know I could never forget about you.  
**Chie:** So then, you went back home to get this?  
**Mihono:** Yeah. I'd totally forgotten where I'd left it, so it took me all this time to find.  
**Mihono:** But... Chii-nee. This one's also the real ribbon from back then.  
**Mihono:** Will you take it?  
**Chie:** ...Thank you, Mihono-chan.  
**Chie:** The ribbon I got from the others... And this ribbon too, and the torn ribbon as well... These are all my treasures.

## [Railgun - Chie: Start]: Sightseeing Kamakura with Onee-san
**Ruiko:** I was thinking this seeing it up close, but, doesn't the Great Buddha of Kamakura seem kind of hunched over?  
**Chie:** Now that you mention it, it is, isn't it. Maybe it's to make it easier for visitors to see his face?  
**Kazari:** Ah, that sounds like it could be the reason why.  
**Kazari:** What should we do next? There were other places I wanted to go see, but it's probably going to get dark soon.  
**Ruiko:** Still, isn't it a little early to be heading back?  
**Chie:** That's right, in that case, why don't we go get something sweet to eat? There's a place I want to visit.  
**Ruiko:** I'm all for it\!  
**Kazari:** I can't wait\!  
**Ruiko:** Ahh-, that shiruko was so good. They went all out with the azuki beans. I'm a fan now\!  
**Chie:** The mochi was just the right size too, so it felt fine eating before dinner.  
**Kazari:** The cream anmitsu was delicious too. If only Misaka-san and everyone were here to taste it.  
**Ruiko:** Right-? I get the feeling they've been working a little too hard.  
**Chie:** That's true. Let's buy something to bring back as a present for them.  
**Kazari:** Sure\! Setouchi-san, thank you very much for taking us sightseeing around Kamakura today.  
**Chie:** You're very welcome. I'd never taken a good look at the sights here myself, so it was fun.  
**Ruiko:** On top of that, you treated us to oden at that shop just now. Thanks a lot\!  
**Chie:** Fufu, it was nothing. Don't mention it.  
**Ruiko:** The croquettes we tried on the way were tasty too; I'm really glad you came with us, Setouchi-san\!  
**Chie:** Sanae-chan is the one who told me, if you're going into Kamakura, you have to stop by that croquette shop.  
**Kazari:** I see. So that was one of Iwakura-san's picks.  
**Ruiko:** We'll have to tell her thanks later then. Anyway, to finish off our sightseeing, let's pick out some souvenirs\!  
**Ruiko:** What would be good-? It's gotta be something for everyone to eat, right? Since there's a lot of people, we should buy a variety of stuff.  
**Ruiko:** It would've been great if we had gotten some of that shiruko from before as a present.  
**Kazari:** I want to get some Kamakura Great Buddha candy and something else. Come to think of it, we've been eating different things all day, haven't we?  
**Chie:** Isn't that fine? Savoring tasty foods is one of the goals of sightseeing.  
**Chie:** But the shops might be closing up for the day soon, so we should hurry.  
**Ruiko/Kazari:** Okaaay\~\.  

## [Railgun - Chie: End]: Lets Make Lovely Flower Decorations with Onee-san
**Ruiko:** I want to do something to thank her, you know? Not just for taking us around Kamakura yesterday, but for everything Setouchi-san's been doing for us.  
**Kazari:** Me too. Though, I can't come up with any good ideas.  
**Chie:** Ah, do you two have some spare time right now? There's something I'd like your help with.  
**Ruiko:** Sure thing, whatever we can do to help\! Right, Uiharu?  
**Kazari:** Right\! Whatever you need us for\!  
**Chie:** Fufu, thank you. Could you come with me for a minute?  
**Ruiko:** Where are we going? Are we leaving the school?  
**Chie:** No, it's only just in the courtyard there. There were some pretty flowers in bloom, so I wanted to stop by.  
**Kazari:** Hmm. I'm a little curious in seeing what kind of flowers they have now.  
**Ruiko:** ......  
**Ruiko:** I was wondering what you needed our help with, but we're making a wreath of flowers for some reason\!\?  
**Kazari:** Don't fool around, Saten-san. Let's make this properly.  
**Ruiko:** You say that, but-. It's pretty hard working with flowers.  
**Kazari:** You're great with sewing, so if you just do it carefully, you should be fine.  
**Ruiko:** Fine, I'll get a little serious I guess-.  
**Kazari:** Ah, Setouchi-san. What do you think of using this next?  
**Chie:** Oh, that would be great. This is turning into a fine flower wreath with all the nice ones you're picking out, Uiharu-san.  
**Kazari:** Do you think so? I'm just choosing the ones that catch my eye.  
**Chie:** I really like this wreath we've made together.  
**Kazari:** Ehehe... I'm happy to hear you think that.  
**Ruiko:** Still, why are we making a wreath of flowers all of a sudden?  
**Chie:** Uiharu-san's wreath is so adorable that I sort of felt like making one.  
**Kazari:** ...?  
**Ruiko:** Ah-, so that's what this is about.  
**Chie:** And, I thought I'd give this wreath as a gift. The one we're making now, I think it would look perfect on you, Uiharu-san. The color combination, and the types of flowers we used.  
**Chie:** I'd be happy if you're happy with that.  
**Kazari:** ......  
**Ruiko:** ...U-Uiharu?  
**Kazari:** Um... Thank you very much. I can't let your kindness go to waste. I'll treasure it.  
**Ruiko:** That's great-... I was worried for a minute there.  
**Kazari:** ? What are you talking about, Saten-san.  
**Ruiko:** Ehh-...  
**Chie:** Now then, how about we make another one for Saten-san\~\.  
**Kazari:** Sure\~\.

## [Dress - Chie: Start]: Taking a Breather
**Chie:** Nnn...\! They're finally done drawing raffle tickets-. I can take a break at last.  
**Chie:** I wonder if there's any food left?  
**Ellen:** Thanks for helping out, Chie\!  
**Hashi Keiko:** Yes, thank you, Setouchi-san.  
**Chie:** You two worked hard yourselves.  
**Chie:** I'm happy the raffle competition went off without a hitch. Though, Kaoru-san... It's too bad about her.  
**Ellen:** That's just business as usual for Kaoru, so it's fine\! More importantly, you must be feeling hungry, right?  
**Ellen:** We went and got food just for you, Chie\!  
**Keiko:** H-Here you go\!  
**Chie:** Thank you. I was actually starving.  
**Chie:** An assortment of cakes from Ellen-san, and pizza from Hashi-san.  
**Keiko:** W-We didn't know what you liked, so we picked safe choices...  
**Keiko:**　Ah, I made sure the pizza was good too. Like this Genovese here, or this cheese...  
**Chie:** Hmm, are they? Let me have a taste... Mm, this sauce is perfect.  
**Keiko:** I'm glad you're happy with it.  
**Keiko:** ...Thanks for everything you did, Setouchi-san. I was very nervous, and... it's because of you I managed to do my job in the executive committee.  
**Chie:** ...Mm-mm, I didn't do anything special.  
**Chie:** And besides, if you hadn't been there, Hashi-san, I think we would have been in more trouble, like with setting up the stage.  
**Chie:** It was a real help having you along with us, alright?  
**Keiko:** Setouchi-san...\!  
**Ellen:** Chie\! The cakes I got are excellent too\! These had to have been made by a first-class patissier\!  
**Ellen:** Hurry up and have some\!  
**Chie:** H-Hang on, Ellen-san... I-I can't eat that quickly\!  
**Keiko:** U-Um, Setouchi-san, what foods do you like? I'll go get some.  
**Chie:** Thank you. But, that sentiment alone is enough.  
**Chie:** I'm sure they wouldn't have any hoba miso... And I don't think grilled fish would go very well with pizza, would it?  
**Keiko:** You're probably right.  
**Chie:** I'll have the cake now, Ellen-san. ...Oh, this is tasty.  
**Chie:** The cream's so fluffy... I feel like I could just keep on eating these.  
**Ellen:** Yes\! It's like it melts in your mouth\!  

## [Dress - Chie: End]: Because I'm Her Onee-san
**Chie:** Phew... I think I overate a tad.  
**Mihono:** Heyyy\! Chii-nee\!  
**Chie:** Mihono-chan, and... Etou-san? Is something wrong?  
**Kanami:** Ah, nothing like that, Mihono-chan and I were just going around trying the food on all the tables\!  
**Mihono:** Did you already eat, Chii-nee?  
**Chie:** Yes, I did. Ellen-san and Hashi-san went and got me some pizza and cake to eat.  
**Kanami:** Pizza and cake\! They both sound good\!  
**Chie:** They were. I ate too much before I could help it.  
**Mihono:** Ahaha, you're a real greedy eater like that, Chii-nee.  
**Chie:** I don't want to hear that from you when you're the one still eating, Mihono-chan.  
**Mihono:** Ah, I guess you've got me there...  
**Kanami:** ...Setouchi-san, you feel a little different when you're talking with Mihono-chan.  
**Kanami:** Normally it's like, you're really adult\!  
**Chie:** We have been friends since we were little, after all. Though... Do I really seem that adult?  
**Kanami:** When you're wearing a dress that sexy, you look way more adult than me.  
**Chie:** I-Is it too much?  
**Mihono:** No way, Chii-nee\! You look really good in it\!  
**Mihono:** Hey, Kanami. You think we'll have that kind of sexiness in a few years?  
**Kanami:** That might be... a little tough for us.  
**Chie:** Come on, you two. Those dresses look nice on you as well, you know?  
**Chie:** You look like proper young ladies.  
**Mihono:** You mean it? Kanami, we're ladies now\!  
**Kanami:** Ladies... It's kinda embarrassing, getting called that.  
**Chie:** And besides, you two will be ready to wear a dress like mine before you know it.  
**Mihono:** Ehh, are you sure about that...?  
**Kanami:** Though, when Setouchi-san says it, it sounds like it really could happen.  
**Mihono:** You're not wrong... That's Chii-nee for you\!  
**Chie:** And what do you mean by that, Mihono-chan?  
**Mihono:** I dunno? Ah, I guess cause you're Chii-nee and all, that's what I'd expect\!  
**Chie:** Because I'm me... Is that why? Well thanks, Mihono-chan.  
**Kanami:** That's enough for you?  
**Chie:** Of course. After all, I am her onee-san.

## [Nurse - Chie: Start]: I'm Worried After All
**Mihono:** You're going to be in a practical exercise for medical courses?  
**Chie:** That's right. It's part of a lecture I took that sounded interesting. Which is why I won't be there for the investigation team on the day of the exercise.  
**Mirja:** I understand.  
**Mirja:** Everyone's shown considerable growth lately. Even not having you with us, there shouldn't be any problems.  
**Chie:** ...I'm glad to hear it.  
**Chie:** (That gives me some relief, but... it makes me a little lonely too.)  
**Kiyoka:** What is it you'll be doing for a practical exercise in a medical course?  
**Chie:** It looks like we'll be acting as nurses.  
**Yui:** Are you serious\!\?  
**Yui:** Ah, I wanna see. I wanna see it so bad. Chie-san as a nurse; she'd be a real angel in white\!  
**Kofuki:** Huh? Like Chichie could ever cut it as an angel.  
**Chie:** ...  
**Kofuki:** She's more like a demon\! A demon in white\!  
**Kofuki:** You've never seen Chichie get pissed for real before. You can totally see horns and everything.  
**Chie:** Fufu, Kofuki-chan? Don't you think that might be the fault of the one making me upset?  
**Kofuki:** See, look at her\! She's freaky as hell, right\!  
**Chie:** Kofuki-chan? Get on your knees.  
**Yui:** Look, that's what you get for making Chie-san angry.  
**Kiyoka:** Yui-chan's completely right, Kofuki-san.  
**Yui:** Forgetting about Kofuki-san, we all think you'd look great in it. Chie-san in her nurse cosplay\!  
**Chie:** ...  
**Mihono:** Cosplay?  
**Yui:** Yeah, Mihono-chan\!  
**Yui:** Must be so nice, Chie-san in nurse cosplay\! I want her to nurse me gently inside and out\!  
**Chie:** Yui-chan?  
**Yui:** Yes, Chie-san\!  
**Chie:** On your knees.  
**Yui:** Why me too\!\?  
**Chie:** Honestly now.  
**Chie:** Mirja, I'm sure it won't be easy on you, but do your best looking after them.  
**Mirja:** ...I know, I will.  

## [Nurse - Chie: End]: It's Alright
**Sakura:** ...I'm Hamatsuka Sakura, from the medical department. I'm glad to be working with you today.  
**Chie:** And I am too, Hamatsuka-san. I'm Setouchi Chie.  
**Chie:** It's nice to meet you... Though, this isn't the first time we've met, is it?  
**Sakura:** Yes. I've seen you sometimes, at Ban-san's lab.  
**Sakura:** Though, this is the first time we've had an actual conversation.  
**Chie:** That's right.  
**Chie:** As soon as you're done treating us, you always leave right away, Hamatsuka-san.  
**Sakura:** ...I'm sorry.  
**Chie:** Fufu, it's not anything you need to apologize for.  
**Chie:** Though, I've always thought that I wanted to talk with you, so I'm glad.  
**Chie:** No matter how small the injury, you always treat it with care, don't you, Hamatsuka-san? So I was curious what sort of girl you were.  
**Sakura:** But, I'm not that...  
**Nurse:** We're going to be starting the practical exercise soon. Please gather around-.  
**Sakura:** Ah, the exercise is starting. We should go.  
**Chie:** ...She ran away. Did I do something to make her not like me?  
**Patient A:** Thank you very much.  
**Chie:** Not at all; please take care of yourself.  
**Patient B:** Excuse me, I'd like to ask something...  
**Chie:** Yes, what do you need?  
**Sakura:** (...She's amazing. So many people are just going over to Setouchi-san...)  
**Sakura:** ...  
**Chie:** Good work, Hamatsuka-san. That was nerve-wracking, with how unfamiliar I was with everything.  
**Sakura:** You didn't seem that way at all. Um...  
**Chie:** What is it?  
**Sakura:** There's something I'm having trouble with...  
**Chie:** Mmhm?  
**Sakura:** ...No, I shouldn't be asking you after all. I can't go into much detail about it...  
**Chie:** (Was what's bothering her the reason she avoided me before?\)  
**Chie:** ...You said you're having trouble with something, but, do you know exactly what it is?  
**Sakura:** ...I do.  
**Chie:** (If I had to guess... She's avoiding getting involved with other people? But, she's trying to talk about it with me...)  
**Chie:** You'll be alright.  
**Sakura:** Eh?  
**Chie:** You're a kind and earnest girl, Hamatsuka-san. So long as you know what's causing it, I'm sure you'll get through it someday.  
**Sakura:** ...  
**Sakura:** Thank you very much. That makes me feel a little better.  
**Chie:** No, I'm the one who should be thanking you.  
**Chie:** After all, without people like you there for us, us toji wouldn't be able to keep on fighting.  
**Chie:** So... we'll keep being in your care in the future.  
**Sakura:** Okay\!
