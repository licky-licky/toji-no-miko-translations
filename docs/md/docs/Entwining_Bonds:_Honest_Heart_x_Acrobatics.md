## 1: Going After the Highest Grade Coordination
**Mihono:** Uwah, what do I do? I keep chopping them up but more keep coming-\!  
**Ellen:** Mihomiho, help has arrived\!  
**Mihono:** Ellen-san\! And Kaoru-san too; thanks a bunch\!  
**Kaoru:** Doesn't look like you're in any position for small talk. Huh, Ellen?  
**Ellen:** That's true. Mihomiho, just leave this here to Kaoru and me\! Kaoru, let's go\!  
**Ellen:** TAAAAAAAAAAA\!\!\!  
**Kaoru:** KIEEEEEEE...\!  
**Mihono:** Th-They're amazing... The aradama were spread all over, but they're getting pushed into one place.  
**Ellen/Kaoru:** HAAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Mihono:** (All those aradama, and the two of them got rid of them in a flash...)  
**Ellen:** Mihomiho? What's the matter?  
**Mihono:** Sorry\! You two were just so coordinated that I was speechless.  
**Mihono:** Um, if it's alright with you, could you teach me the secrets to working together with someone?  
**Kaoru:** Sorry, but I've got an afternoon nap to get back to. Ellen, it's down to you...  
**Ellen:** She went and left us, huh. Mihomiho, do you want me to give you a lesson with just the two of us?  
**Mihono:** Of course\! I'm in your care.  
**Ellen:** First off, let's check what level you're at right now\! Try moving together with me as if we're being attacked by enemies from all sides.  
**Mihono:** Got it\! Then, let's get right to it...  
**Mihono:** TAAAAAAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Ellen:** Wow\! Mihomiho, if you push out on your own like that, there's nothing for me to coordinate with\!  
**Mihono:** Ah-- that's right. Right after I asked you to come give me special training on that too. Sorry... I really can't do anything right.  
**Ellen:** Please don't look so down in the dumps. We've only just started your lessons.  
**Mihono:** But still...  
**Ellen:**  Since you can't get it right now, it'll feel that much more fun and satisfying when we're done\!  
**Mihono:** Ellen-san... Thanks a lot. Then, let me try it one more time\!  
**Ellen:** Okay\! Here we go...  
**Mihono:** Wait, why'd aradama show up now\!\? And I was just starting to get into it-.  
**Ellen:** Let's think positive\! This is the perfect chance to test how well we can coordinate with each other\!  
**Mihono:** Oh yeah, you're right\! I'm gonna give it my all then\!  
**Ellen:** Alright, match up with me, and let's go\!  
**Ellen:** Mihomiho, you did good work back there. We managed to clear them out together.  
**Mihono:** [Pant... pant...] Ellen-san, I'm sorry. I couldn't move around all that great at all...  
**Mihono:** I bet that, if you were fighting with Kaoru-san, this would have been nothing for you...  
**Ellen:** It's nothing for you to feel depressed over. You must be tired after fighting so much, so why don't we end today's lesson here?  
**Mihono:** Okay. Thanks a lot for helping me today. I'm going to do a little more training on my own.  
**Ellen:** It's not a good idea to push your body too hard when you're already tired.  
**Mihono:** Still, if I can improve a little, I want to try\! I have to think over the parts I messed up today before I forget them...  
**Ellen:** I think that's important too, but... Mihomiho, can you come out with me for a while? There's someplace I want to take you.  
**Mihono:** But...  
**Ellen:** We'll change up the location and keep our lesson going. Come on\!  
**Ellen:** This is my treat today, so let's enjoy some delicious sweets together\!  
**Mihono:** Eh... Why sweets? ...Oh, I get it.  
**Mihono:** You're really nice, Ellen-san. You made that up about the lesson so you could bring me here.  
**Mihono:**  But I still want to get even stronger. If I have the time to be having fun, I'd rather be training...  
**Ellen:** You've got it all wrong, Mihomiho. I brought you here to show you the secret to coordination.  
**Mihono:** The secret to coordination's in a cake shop\!\? How's that work?  

## 2: The Secret to Coordination\!\?
**Ellen:** They're going to start serving us all kinds of drinks and sweets, Mihomiho. I want you to enjoy them exactly how I tell you, okay?  
**Mihono:** Okay...  
**Ellen:** First off, while you drink a cup of this black tea, try eating some of this orange tart.  
**Mihono:** Whoa\! That's yummy\~\! I can't put my fork down.  
**Ellen:** Next, savor this espresso together with this bitter chocolate.  
**Mihono:** Ohm ohm. Wow-\! This has more of an adult flavor. It's really tasty\!  
**Ellen:** And, lastly, this bitter matcha tea with this set of Japanese sweets.  
**Mihono:** Mmm\~\! This's delicious too\! Ahh\~, when you eat something yummy, it just feels like all the bad stuff goes flying away.  
**Ellen:** I finally got you to smile. It was worth bringing you here after all\!  
**Mihono:** Thanks for bringing me. But, Ellen-san, what does this have to do with the secret to coordination?  
**Ellen:** The secret is, all of the sweets you had today were a marriage of deliciousness\!  
**Mihono:** Marriage? What do you mean?  
**Ellen:** In French, it is the word for "being married", but it also means "to have a match of the highest compatibility."  
**Mihono:** The highest compatibility...  
**Ellen:** When you understand each other's traits verrry well, and combine them the best way possible, 1+1 can be 10 or 100...  
**Ellen:** Doesn't you think that's similar to the lessons we're doing on coordinating?  
**Mihono:** Now that you mention it, that sounds just like how you and Kaoru-san fit together.  
**Ellen:** That's right. Kaoru is usually in energy conservation mode, so she might come across as a bit unreliable when we're fighting. But, that just means she has plenty of effort to spare when it really counts.  
**Ellen:** I know that by heart, so, when Kaoru is with me, I feel safe jumping into even the most dangerous situations.  
**Mihono:** So that's how it is...  
**Ellen:** Of course, it is important to polish your skills with plenty of training on your own. But, I think that the secret to coordination is to learn lots about your fighting partner and come to trust each other.  
**Mihono:** Learn lots about your partner, and trust each other... I've been so focused on myself that I haven't felt free to think about other people at all...  
**Mihono:** But, like that, there's no way I'd be able to get good coordination with anybody else.  
**Ellen:** Cheer up, Mihomiho. If there's something you can't do, just try phrasing it a different way, and then you'll see what you can do about it\! If you can improve on that, I'm sure you'll get a lot stronger\!  
**Mihono:** Ellen-san... You're right; where there's a will, there's a way\! I'll give it my best shot\!  
**Ellen:** I like that response\! In that case, how about we have our next lesson a week from now?  
**Mihono:** Sure\! Okaaay, I'll work hard at my own secret special training for next week\!  

## 3: Mihono's Secret Special Training
**Mihono:** What's important is to know your partners well and trust them. So that means, I'll have to watch them extra close, right\!  
**Mihono:** I'll start off by doing some in depth investigating on the people I spend the most time fighting with: everybody from the investigation team\!  
**Mihono:** To see the sides of them that they usually wouldn't show, I have to be extra sneaky, so they won't notice...  
**Kofuki:** Oi, Mihocchi\! What're you sneaking around for\!  
**Mihono:** Wah\!\? She found me out right away.  
**Kofuki:** What were you up to?  
**Mihono:** Sorry, sorry... I wasn't doing anything. Anyway, later-\!  
**Mihono:** Sigh. It's pretty tough, watching somebody without them finding out. Ah, that's Yui over there\!  
**Mihono:** (This time for sure, I'll follow her around all sneaky so she won't see...)  
**Mihono:** (Alright, I've been following her for a pretty long time and she hasn't suspected a thing. That should be enough info on Yui. Next is...)  
**Yui:** Ehh, Mihono-chan, are you done already? You can follow me around some more, you know-.  
**Mihono:** Yui\! You found out\!\? Since when?  
**Yui:** I knew the whooole time, from the very start. There's no way I wouldn't know when a girl has her eyes on me.  
**Mihono:** Ughh... I shouldn't be surprised when it comes to Yui. But, still, that's important info too. I'll write it down. "Sensitive to signs of girls"...  
One week later.

  
**Mihono:** Phew, it was really tough, but I somehow finished my secret special training in time\! I hope I get to show off the progress I made today\~.  
**Mihono:** Wait, why are aradama showing up now\!\? And there's so many of them...  
**Mihono:** No, now's not the time to lose my nerve\! Where there's a will, there's a way\!  
**Mihono:** YAAAAA\!\!  
**Mihono:** HAAH\!  
**Mihono:** No way-\!\? I'm surrounded...\!  
**Aradama:** GUOOOOOOO\!  
**Mihono:** \!\!\!  
**Ellen:** I'll protect you, Mihomiho\! YAAAAAAAAAAAAA\!  
**Mihono:** E-Ellen-san\!\? Thanks a lot. You saved me.  
**Ellen:** You don't have to thank me. Come on, let's take down the rest of the aradama together\!  
**Mihono:** We're coordinating, aren't we\! I'm glad I'll get to show off the results of my special training right away\!  
**Ellen:** That sounds promising\! Let's show them our best together\!  
**Mihono:** Yeah\! Here goes\! TAAAAAAAAAAAAA\!\!\!\!  
**Ellen:** Mihomiho, leave that one to me\! YAAAAAAAAAAAA\!\!\!  
**Mihono:** Okay\! Ellen-san, let's finish it together\!  
**Mihono/Ellen:** HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\!\!\!\!\!\!  
**Mihono:** ...We beat all of them\! Ellen-san\! We worked together great, didn't we\!\!  
**Ellen:** We did\! What kind of training did you do, to get to such excellent coordination in just one week\!\?  
**Mihono:** ...I did this\! Please check over what I learned from a whole week of secret training\!  
**Ellen:** Hmhm, what's this notepad for?  
**Mihono:** You're the one who told me the secret to coordinating was learning lots about your partner, so,  
**Mihono:** I watched everybody and kept a journal of the things they did.  
**Ellen:** Fukki, Yuiyui, Chie, Mirja, Kiyoka... Fufu, you must have spent the whole week watching everyone from the investigation team.  
**Mihono:** Not just the investigation team; take a look at this notepad too\!  
**Ellen:** Wow\! This whole notepad is just about me? You did an impressive job stalking\!  
**Mihono:** Eheheh. I really wanted to get good coordination with you here, Ellen-san, so I tried my best.  
**Ellen:** Mihomiho... I'm a little surprised, but you showed how well you can put it to use today.  
**Ellen:** I guess you being a stalker turned out for the best\!  
**Kaoru:** Well-, Ellen here's a stalker herself too.  
**Ellen:** Kaoru\!\? I told you to keep that a secret...  
**Kaoru:** There's no point hiding it. This last week, Ellen was worried about you too, so she was secretly watching over you.  
**Mihono:** You were\!\? Then that means, we were both watching each other...  
**Ellen:** This is kind of, a little embarrassing now.  
**Kaoru:** Look at that, you two're head over heels.  
**Mihono:** Oh yeah\! I want to coordinate better with Kaoru-san next, so can I watch you too?  
**Kaoru:** No way\!  
**Mihono:** What's wrong with that? I'll do it all sneaky; you won't even notice\!  
**Kaoru:** Cut it out-.  
**Ellen:** If you keep getting along this well, it shouldn't take long at all for you to have some good coordination going.
