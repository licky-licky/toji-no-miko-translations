## [Pirate - Yui: Start]: After the Mission, We're Pirates\!
**Aradama:** GGGII...\!  
**Ellen:** --YAAH\!  
**Yui:** Great work as always, Ellen-san\! You look so cool swinging your okatana around; I can't keep my eyes off you\~.  
**Ellen:** You're not going to make anything happen like that, Yuiyui. But thanks all the same.  
**Yui:** Cool older girls are a treasure of their own\!  
**Kiyoka:** Yui-chan\!\? There's an aradama coming after you\!  
**Yui:** Thanks\! Nice spot, Kiyoka-chan\!  
**Yui:** --ORYAAAAAAAAAAA\!  
**Kiyoka:** That should be all the aradama around here for now.  
**Kiyoka:** Sigh... You made me worried because you were looking away so much.  
**Yui:** Sorry, sorry. My eyes'll stay glued to you from now on, so forgive me, Kiyoka-chan\!  
**Kiyoka:** You're not giving me any reason to forgive you at all.  
**Yui:** Eh\!\?  
**Ellen:** Ahaha. The investigation team really gets along, don't they.  
**Kiyoka:** When we first met, I never thought it would turn out like this, but we're just fine now. It's fun being with everyone.  
**Yui:** Mmhmm. I love all the girls in the investigation team, so I always want to be with them wherever they go.  
**Kiyoka:** Yui-chan... Stalking is absolutely off limits, okay?  
**Yui:** You've got it all wrong. I'll be there at all times to protect my lovable investigation team from any perverts out there. It's a great idea\!  
**Ellen:** You sure do come up with some unique ideas, Yuiyui.  
**Yui:** I knew you'd understand\! I love you, Ellen-san\!  
**Ellen:** Yui\~. I love you too.  
**Kiyoka:** E-Ellen-san... Please, for our sakes, don't encourage Yui-chan too much...  
**Ellen:** It would be a good idea though, if you didn't have to worry about Yuiyui's own health and safety. But there wouldn't be any time for Yuiyui herself to rest.  
**Yui:** Keeping an eye on good looking girls would fill me up with power, so I think it has a chance to work\!  
**Kiyoka:** There isn't one, okay? You don't have a chance.  
**Ellen:** You don't miss a beat playing off each other. It's perfect.  
**Mihono:** Kiyoka\~, Yui\~, Ellen-saaan\~\!  
**Kiyoka:** Hono-chan? Are you done over there too?  
**Mihono:** Yeah\! Akira-san was with me and all. And Satsuki-san knew just where the aradama would be going, so it made fighting easy.  
**Mihono:** --But hey, that wasn't what I wanted to talk about. The person in charge of the amusement park asked, after we're done clearing out the aradama, if we wanted to play around in the park a little\!  
**Mihono:** And also, with this new attraction they just started\! "The Treasures of Pirates"\! You want to try it, right?  
**Ellen:** Sure we will\!  
**Yui:** That's the one where they lend you pirate costumes, right? Boss would probably look so good in that\! I wanna see it\!  
**Kiyoka:** It does sound kind of fun. But, what about Kofuki-san and Juujou-san?  
**Ellen:** I think they'll be fine with it, but I'll check with them just in case.  
**Mihono:** Ah, thanks for that\! We'll go on ahead and meet up with Akira-san then\!

## [Pirate - Yui: Start]: Captain Yui's Treasures
**Yui:** Welcome to my band of pirates, Ellen-san, Kiyoka-chan\! We're going to find the treasure for sure\!  
**Ellen:** Aye aye sir\! Captain Yui\! We'll have the treasure in our hands\!  
**Kiyoka:** You're really getting into this, Ellen-san\!\?  
**Ellen:** You have to go all out with this kind of thing\! You should enjoy it as much as you can too, Kiyoka\!  
**Kiyoka:** Alright\! Then... Captain Yui\! What treasure are we after this time?  
**Yui:** The treasures that I'm after. That'd be--  
**Yui:** The fine and dashing ladies of the pirate groups Captain Suu and Captain Boss are leading around\!  
**Ellen:** What\!\?  
**Yui:** You can all be under my command... Eheheheh.  
**Kiyoka:** Our objective is to find treasure pendants hidden by old pirates by using our maps before the time runs out...\!  
**Kiyoka:** If we steal the other team's maps, we'll get points, but girls don't get us anything.  
**Yui:** If we get the girls, we get the maps too\! That way we get all the spoils, Kiyoka-chan.  
**Kiyoka:** Okay... I get it already.  
**Kiyoka:** So stealing their maps is our first goal then?  
**Ellen:** Does that we won't use the clues on the map we have to find the treasure until later?  
**Yui:** Yep. The maps aren't all going to be real ones, and besides, doesn't plundering sound like a real pirate thing to do?  
**Ellen:** Aye aye sir\! We'll plunder with all we've got\!  
**Kiyoka:** Uhh... Aye aye sir...\!  
**Yui:** Then, we're setting off\!  
**Yui:** Ah, I've got eyes on Captain Boss's ship\!  
**Kiyoka:** Captain\! If we take down their pirate flag, we'll get their treasure map\! Should we board them?  
**Yui:** Uwahh\~\~\~\~\!  
**Yuui:** Mihono-chan, Boss, Satsuki-san; they're all looking so good...\! Ahhh\~\!  
**Yui:** Boss's miniskirt...\! Those tempting thighs...\!  
**Yui:** Ah\! They're boarding us\!\?  
**Kiyoka:** Honestly... Come down from the crow's nest and protect our pirate flag, Yui-chan\!  
**Yui:** Aye aye sir\! I'll be there to protect you, Kiyoka-chan\!  
**Ellen:** Alright, let's do all we can to protect our captain and pirate flag\!  
**Kiyoka:** Right\!  
**Akira:** You two're raring to go.  
**Ellen:** We're not going to go down so easy, Inagon, Yomiyomi\!  
**Akira:** Well bring it on\!  
**Ellen:** While we were fighting, Hiyoyon and them found the treasure.  
**Yui:** We might've lost, but it was still fun-\! And I got pictures of everybody's pirate cosplay\!  
**Ellen:** You always put everything into having a good time, Yuiyui. I think that's so nice.  
**Yui:** Ehehe, how about we come have fun again someday\! I want to keep getting more and more treasures for myself\!
