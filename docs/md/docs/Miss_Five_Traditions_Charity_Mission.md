## 1: But I Don't Wanna\!
**Announcement:** We're sorry to have kept you waiting so long--  
**Announcement:** After tallying the votes--  
**Announcement:** The \"Miss Five Traditions\"--  
**Announcement:** Who you have chosen is--  
**Announcement:** Tsubakuro Yume-san\!  
**Yume:** Me\!\?  
**Maki:** Congratulations, Yume\. It's a little frustrating to hear, but I'm glad it was you who won\.  
**Suzuka:** Yes\. I feel the same way\.  
**Suzuka:** To choose Yume, the judges must have a discerning eye\.  
**Yomi:** We should celebrate\. I'll cook a special batch of rice\.  
**Yume:** \~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~Hooray-\!  
**Yume:** Thanks, onee-sans\! I'm really happy right now\!  
**Yume:** I'll let everybody in the world see a whole lot of what makes me so strong\!  
**Yume:** I don't wanna\!\!  
**Yukari:** This has already been decided on\.  
**Yukari:** Tsubakuro, Etou, Satsuki, Juujou, Yanase, Asakura, Setouchi, Yamashiro, Mashiko, Itomi\.  
**Yukari:** The above-mentioned top ten Miss Five Traditions contestants will participate in charity activities\.  
**Yukari:** Your first task is to pay a visit to a hospital\.  
**Yume:** But, doing that won't even show anybody how strong I am\.\.\.  
**Yukari:** \.\.\.What do the rest of you think\?  
**Kanami:** If going will help cheer them up, then I'll go\! Right, Hiyori-chan\!  
**Hiyori:** That's for sure\. If it'll cheer up the patients at the hospital, there's nothing better we can do\.  
**Mihono:** Visiting a hospital, huh\.\.\. It sorta feels like we're celebrities, doesn't it\!  
**Chie:** Mihono-chan, this is a mission, so we have to do it seriously, okay\?  
**Mihono:** I know that, Chii-nee\!  
**Mihono:** But, with you and Yui here from the investigation team, and Kanami and them too\.\.\. It's bound to be fun\!  
**Yui:** Mmhmm\!  
**Yui:** Ah, Yukari-sama\! I want to be in charge of photography\!  
**Yui:** Would it be alright for me to take candid shots of the Miss Five Traditions candidates\!\?  
**Yukari:** Of course; I'll approve of it\.  
**Yui:** Yesss\!  
**Kaoru:** If it gets me away from suppression missions, I'm down for anything\.  
**Sayaka:** A hospital\.\.\.  
**Sayaka:** If we made Mai's cookies, would it make them happy\?  
**Mai:** Ah, that's a good idea\! Will you help me with them, Sayaka-chan\?  
**Sayaka:** Mm\.  
**Yukari:** What about you, Satsuki\?  
**Yomi:** If it's my mission\.  
**Yukari:** So, all besides Tsubakuro will be participating\.  
**Yume:** Ugh\.\.\.  
**Yume:** B-But, hey\! I'm not interested in stuff like paying people visits\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** If the top ranking Yume-chan isn't there, I'm sure the patients'll be disappointed\.  
**Yume:** \.\.\.You think so\?  
**Kanami:** I know they'll be\!  
**Kanami:** And anyway, I want to go together with you\. Everyone feels the same, right\?  
**Sayaka:** Mm, it's best if we go together\.  
**Yume:** If you and Sayaka-chan say so, then\.\.\. I guess I have to\!  
**Yume:** I'll go along with you\!  

## 2: She Likes Omusubi
**Yui:** The casual expressions you get while traveling are the best\!  
**Yui:** Kanami-chan, Hiyori-chan\! Bring your faces even closer together\.\.\. And, smile\!  
**Yui:** Now that's priceless\!  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.I was just doing what she told us, but does this actually count as a casual expression\?  
**Kanami:** It's fine\! Yui-chan, could you give me a copy of that picture\?  
**Yui:** Sure thing\! I'll give you one too, Hiyori-chan\!  
**Hiyori:** F-Fine\.\.\.  
**Yui:** Now, who should I take pictures of next\~\.  
**Hiyori:** She just follows wherever her desires take her, doesn't she\.\.\. Was it really a good idea giving her the camera\?  
**Kanami:** Ahaha\.  
**Kanami:** Oh, that reminds me, Yume-chan\.  
**Yume:** About what, Onee-san\?  
**Kanami:** Let's spar later on\! We managed to get all these strong toji together, so it'd be a waste if we didn't\.  
**Yume:** I'll do it\!  
**Yume:** And not just with you, Chidori-onee-san, but with that onee-san too, and I wanna fight Sayaka-chan too\.  
**Hiyori:** I don't mind, if there's time\.  
**Sayaka:** Me either\.  
**Yume:** Great\!  
**Yui:** Ahhh, a group of smiling cuties is the best\. Not good, my nose'll start bleeding\.\.\.  
**Chie:** Don't get yourself too worked up, Yui-chan\.  
**Yui:** Riiight, gonna plug up my nose with tissues\.  
**Chie:** That's not what I was talking about though\.\.\. Honestly\.  
**Chie:** Ah, Yanase-san\. While we have time, would you like to look over our schedule after we reach the hospital\?  
**Mai:** Sure, Chie-san\.  
**Mai:** You and I will be meeting to be greeted by the staff\. Everyone else will go on ahead to the hospital\.\.\.  
**Chie:** It'll be helpful having you with me, Yanase-san\.  
**Mai:** I'll feel reassured having you there too, Chie-san\.  
**Yui:** This pair's looking good too\! Seeing them so earnest together's the best\!  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.Shut up, Yui-\. Let me sleep in peace-\.  
**Yui:** Sorry about that-\.  
**Kaoru:** Seriously\.\.\. [snooze\]\.  
**Yui:** Alright, I got a nice shot\!  
**Mihono:** (I can hear everybody all energetic like that, and yet\.\.\.\)  
**Yomi:** \.\.\.  
**Mihono:** (Why did I end up next to Satsuki-san\!\?\)  
**Mihono:** (I mean, that's fine and all\! The problem is\.\.\. How am I supposed to get Satsuki-san to lighten up and talk about something\!\?\)  
**Yomi:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** (I can't just keep quiet; I've gotta try something\.\.\. Where there's a will, there's a way\!\)  
**Mihono:** I-It's cool that the two of us got chosen for Miss Five Traditions, wasn't it\. I totally thought I wasn't going to get picked\.  
**Yomi:** Yes\.  
**Mihono:** (Yes\!\? What's she even mean by \"Yes\"\!\?\)  
**Mihono:** (\"Yes it's cool that we got chosen\?\" Or, \"Yes I didn't think I would get chosen either\?\"\)  
**Yomi:** \.\.\.  
**Mihono:** (I can't tell anything from looking at her face\.\.\.\)  
**Mihono:** E-Everybody sure is excited, huh\!  
**Yomi:** Yes\.  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** (I-I'm already out of topics\.\.\. No, I've still gotta keep the conversation going\!\)  
**Mihono:** N-Nice, weather, huh\.\.\.  
**Yomi:** Yes\.  
**Mihono:** (\.\.\.\.\.\.Another \"Yes\"\!\? Help me, Kanami\!\! Let my thoughts reach you\!\)  
**Kanami:** \.\.\.\?  
**Mihono:** (Kanami\!\)  
**Kanami:** You look like you're having fun with Satsuki-san, Mihono-chan\.  
**Mihono:** (They didn't reach her at all\!\)  
**Mihono:** Y-You think\? We were just talking about what we liked\.\.\.  
**Yomi:** (We weren't talking about what we liked though\.\.\.\)  
**Yume:** Yomi-onee-san likes omusubi\.  
**Yume:** Right\?  
**Yomi:** Omusubi are delicious\.  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.\!\?  
**Mihono:** That's amazing, Tsubakuro-san\! You got Satsuki-san to say something besides \"Yes\"\!  
**Yomi:** \? I can say things besides yes\.  
**Mihono:** Thanks, Tsubakuro-san\! I think I might be able to get along with Satsuki-san now\!  
**Yume:** You're really thanking me a lot\.\.\. What were you onee-sans talking about\?  
**Yume:** Weird, the train just stopped all of a sudden\.  
**Yomi:** There may have been some kind of trouble\.  
**Chie:** I'll check and see\.  
**Chie:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Chie:** Everyone\! It seems like aradama have appeared in the area\!  
**Yume:** We can't move cause aradama are getting in the way\? Then, all I have to do is beat those aradama\!  

## 3: I Don't Really Like Hospitals
**Mihono/Kanami:** Everybody-\! Hi-\!  
**Kid 1:** Wow\! There's toji\! Why\? Why're toji here\!\?  
**Hiyori:** We came here to visit you\.  
**Kid 2:** We saw you dancing and fighting on TV\! It was really cool\!  
**Kaoru:** It doesn't feel too bad, getting a welcome like this\. Guess we can do them a favor and show off a little\.  
**Sayaka:** Mm\.  
**Nene:** Nene\!  
**Kid 1:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Nene:** Ne\?  
**Kid 1:** This thing's cute\!\! Is it your pet, onee-san\?  
**Kaoru:** Well, something like that\. You can go on and play with Nene\.  
**Kid 1:** Okay\!  
**Sayaka:** Kaoru, weren't you going to show off for them\?  
**Kaoru:** I lent them Nene, so that's already a huge favor, right\?  
**Kid 2:** Onee-san\!  
**Kanami:** What's up\?  
**Kid 2:** Onee-san, you were awesome when you were fighting\!  
**Kanami:** Thank you\.  
**Kid 2:** Where's the other onee-san who you were fighting with\?  
**Kid 2:** I want to tell her what it was like too\!  
**Kid 1:** I want to see you two fight again\!  
**Kanami:** Ahaha, now you've put us on the spot\. What do you think, Yume-chan\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** Huh, she's not here\.  
**Kanami:** Satsuki-san, have you seen Yume-chan anywhere\?  
**Yomi:** If you're looking for Tsubakuro-san, she hasn't been with us since we arrived at the hospital\.  
**Yomi:** \.\.\.I will go search for her\.  
**Kanami:** Ah, then, I'll go with you\.  
**Kid 2:** \.\.\.You're leaving\?  
**Kanami:** As soon as we find Yume-chan, we'll be right back\. Just wait for us\.  
**Kid 2:** Alright\!  
**Kanami:** She's not here either\.\.\. Hmm, where could she have gone\?  
**Yomi:** Etou-san, I've located Tsubakuro-san\. She seems to be in the hills behind here\.  
**Yume:** \.\.\.  
**Kanami:** We found you, Yume-chan\.  
**Yume:** Ah, onee-sans\.\.\.  
**Yume:** I was hiding and everything too\.\.\. But, since Yomi-onee-san's here, she must've found me out\.  
**Yomi:** I did\.  
**Kanami:** Everyone's waiting for you, Yume-chan\! Can you come with us\?  
**Yume:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Yume:** I don't really like hospitals\.  
**Yomi:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Yume:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** \? Why don't you like them\?  
**Yume:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Yume:** I'm not telling\.  
**Yume:** Anyway, why'd you even come out looking for me\? Don't tell me\.\.\. You were using me as an excuse to skip out\?  
**Yume:** Maybe I'll tell on both of you\.  
**Kanami:** Why are you only putting that on us\!\?  
**Yomi:** We aren't skipping out\.  
**Yomi:** The children in the hospital said that they wanted to see you\.  
**Yume:** Why me\?  
**Kanami:** They said they saw the tournament on TV\!  
**Yume:** They saw how strong I was\?  
**Yomi:** Yes\.  
**Yomi:** They also said that they wanted to see you fight with Etou-san again\.  
**Yume:** They did\.\.\.\?  
**Yume:** Well, what else can I do\. I'll go back then\.  
**Kanami:** Even though she just said she doesn't like hospitals\.\.\. Satsuki-san, do you know something about that\?  
**Yomi:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Yomi:** I don't\.  
**Yume:** What're you waiting for, onee-sans\! Let's hurry up and go\!  
**Kanami:** Okaaay\!  
**Kanami:** Let's go, Satsuki-san\.  
**Yomi:** Right\.  

## 4: We've Gotta Protect Them, Don't We\!
**Kanami:** They're in this room, Yume-chan\.  
**Yume:** \.\.\.  
**Kanami:** Yume-chan\?  
**Yume:** It's nothing\.  
**Yume:** C'mon, let's go\!  
**Yomi:** \.\.\.Right\.  
**Children:** Yume-onee-san\!  
**Yume:** \.\.\.  
**Kid 2:** I-It's that Yume-onee-san\!  
**Yume:** H-Huh\?  
**Kid 2:** We watched the tournament\! Yume-onee-san, you were so strong, and you really shined\!  
**Yume:** Th-Thanks\.\.\.  
**Kid 2:** I-I did it, I got to say it, Sayaka-onee-san\!  
**Sayaka:** That's good\.  
**Kid 2:** Yeah, Sayaka-onee-san\!  
**Kid 1:** Yume-onee-san, Kanami-onee-san, will you fight for us\?  
**Yume:** Do you really want to see us fight that bad\?  
**Kid 1:** Yeah\!  
**Kid 2:** I want to see\!  
**Yume:** Aha\!  
**Yume:** I guess we have to then\! What do you think, Chidori-onee-san\?  
**Kanami:** I'm fine with doing it anytime anywhere\.  
**Yume:** Hey, I found the perfect place to fight too\.\.\.  
**Everyone:** -\!\!  
**Kid 1:** That sound is\.\.\.  
**Chie:** \.\.\.Don't worry, it'll be fine\. Leave this to us onee-sans\.  
**Chie:** There's been an outbreak of aradama near here\! We have to go\!  
**Mai:** Maybe we didn't finish off all the aradama when we were on the train\.\.\.  
**Sayaka:** We'll make sure to exorcise them this time\. We can't let there be any victims here\.  
**Kaoru:** Nene, I'm leaving you in charge of keeping the kids safe\.  
**Nene:** Nene\!  
**Kanami:** We're going too, Hiyori-chan, Mihono-chan\!  
**Mihono:** Yeah, Kanami\!  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.I'd feel bad keeping these kids worrying for long\. We'll exorcise them quick\.  
**Yume:** I'm here, so it's not like they have to be that worried\. Right, Yomi-onee-san\?  
**Yomi:** That's true\.  
**Kid 2:** Yume-onee-san\.\.\.  
**Yume:** What\? I want to get out there fast too\.  
**Kid 2:** P-Please do your best\! But, please don't get hurt\!  
**Yume:** \.\.\.  
**Kid 1:** We'll be cheering for you\!  
**Yume:** You don't have to worry so much\. You all saw how strong I am, right\?  
**Children:** Yeah\!  
**Yume:** Then, just you wait\.  
**Yume:** \.\.\.I can beat up some aradama in no time\.  
**Mai:** Sayaka-chan, Hiyori-chan\! Hit at the reinforcements coming\!  
**Sayaka:** Mm\.  
**Hiyori:** Leave it to us\!  
**Chie:** Kaoru-san\! I don't think you're too used to working in tandem with me, but please back me up\!  
**Kaoru:** There's not much difference between you and Ellen, so don't worry about it\! HAAAAAAAAAAAH\!\!  
**Chie:** Not much difference between Ellen-san and I\? \.\.\.So that's how much you trust me\.  
**Kaoru:** (That's not what I meant\.\.\.\)  
**Kaoru:** (\.\.\.But it's probably best I don't say anything\.\)  
**Mihono:** Doesn't it feel kind of like there's more than when we were on the train\? What should we do, Kanami\?  
**Kanami:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Yume:** What do we do\.\.\.\?  
**Yume:** We're just gonna take them all out fast, of course\!  
**Yume:** Geez, there's way too many\! What's up with this\!  
**Yomi:** \.\.\.  
**Yomi:** There seems to be one aradama grouping all of them together\.  
**Yomi:** It's that aradama there, Tsubakuro-san\.  
**Yume:** Thanks, Yomi-onee-san\!  
**Yume:** Everybody, I'm gonna beat that aradama, so I'm leaving the other ones to you\!  
**Mai:** \.\.\.That's probably our best bet\.  
**Mai:** Kanami-chan\!  
**Kanami:** Right\!  
**Kanami:** Yume-chan\! I'll clear a path for you\!  
**Yume:** I'm strong enough, so it's not like I need it\.\.\.  
**Kid 2:** P-Please do your best\! But, please don't get hurt\!  
**Yume:** But just this once, okay\!  
**Kanami:** Yume-chan\!  
**Yume:** What\?  
**Kanami:** It's fun crossing swords too, but\.\.\.  It's nice getting to fight side by side like this, isn't it\?  
**Yume:** \.\.\.  
**Yume:** Yeah\!  
**Yume:** Here I go, Onee-san\! Those kids back there\.\.\. We've gotta protect them, don't we\!  

## 5: They Won't Forget About Me
In a certain room of the hospital--

  
**Hospital Patient 1:** The valkyries are back\!  
**Hospital Patient 2:** Thanks for always fighting off the aradama\!  
**Hospital Patient 3:** I'm feeling better already\! We're fighting off illness too\!  
**Mihono:** Whoa, listen to those cheers\!\! It's sorta makes you blush, huh\.  
**Chie:** We don't often get chances to hear the voices of the people like this\.  
**Mihono:** Yeah\! This alone makes me glad I got into the Miss Five Traditions competition\!  
**Yui:** Good\! I just got a nice photo\!  
**Sayaka:** Yui\. I want you to take one of me too\.  
**Yui:** Course I will\! While we're at it, let's get Mai-chan and everyone in there too\!  
**Mai:** In that case, Sayaka-chan, can I get a picture with you\?  
**Sayaka:** Mm, I want to take one with everyone\.  
Elsewhere--

  
**Children:** Yume-onee-san, Kanami-onee-san, Yomi-onee-san, Hiyori-onee-san, Kaoru-onee-san\!  
**Children:** Thank you very much\!  
**Kid 1:** Hey, hey, who beat the most aradama\?  
**Kanami:** Hmm, who knows\? Though, Yume-chan's the one who beat the strongest aradama\.  
**Kid 2:** That's amazing, Yume-onee-san\!  
**Kid 3:** Seriously\!\? Tell me all about it\!  
**Yume:** You want to hear more\? But, that aradama really wasn't all that strong\.  
**Yume:** It was a piece of cake for me\.  
**Kid 3:** Ohh-\! That's so cool\!  
**Yomi:** \.\.\.Tsubakuro-san\.  
**Yume:** What's up, Yomi-onee-san\?  
**Yomi:** \.\.\.I'm sure that these children won't forget your strength\.  
**Yume:** Even though they didn't actually see me fighting\?  
**Yomi:** Yes\.  
**Yomi:** Even if the person who saved them doesn't remember\.\.\. They still won't forget\.  
**Yume:** Hmm\.  
**Yume:** \.\.\.So these kids won't forget about me\.  
**Kaoru:** You did good too, Nene\. You made sure to keep them safe, right\?  
**Nene:** Nene\!  
**Kid 1:** Ehh, did he though\?  
**Nene:** Ne\!\?  
**Kaoru:** Oi oi, what were you doing-\?  
**Nene:** Nene\! Nenene\!  
**Hiyori:** He's doing all he can to explain himself\.  
**Kanami:** Ahahaha\!  
**Yume:** \.\.\.Okay\!  
**Yume:** Onee-san, this isn't the time to be laughing, remember\?  
**Kanami:** Huh\?  
**Yume:** I mean, weren't we going to show them a sparring match\?  
**Kid 1:** Ah\! About that, we don't need to see it after all\!  
**Yume:** Ehh, why not\?  
**Kid 2:** We all talked about it\. How you'd be tired after beating the aradama, so we shouldn't make you\.  
**Yume:** You mean it\? I was just thinking I wanted to show you though\.  
**Kid 2:** I really did want to see it, but\.\.\.  
**Kid 2:** How can I become a toji like you, Yume-onee-san\!  
**Yume:** You want to be a toji\?  
**Kid 2:** Yes\!  
**Kanami:** Do you look up to Yume\? I'm sure you can be a super strong toji someday\.  
**Kid 2:** \.\.\.You mean it\? Could I be as strong as Yume-onee-san\?  
**Yume:** There's no way you could be as strong as me\.  
**Yume:** I guess you could at least be as strong as those onee-sans though\?  
**Kaoru:** At least be as strong as us, huh-\.  
**Hiyori:** That'd make them a strong toji too\.  
**Kid 2:** \.\.\.I'll try my best\!  
**Yume:** \.\.\.  
**Yomi:** Isn't that nice, Tsubakuro-san\.  
**Yume:** Yeah\! Being Miss Five Traditions might actually be pretty fun\!

## [Valkyrie - Yomi: Start\]: A Sudden Call from Akira
**Akira:** Oiii, Yomi\! Here, over here\~\.  
**Yomi:** I could tell where you were without you having to shout\.  
**Akira:** You just looked like you were kinda spacing out over there\. Anyway, ready to go\?  
**Yomi:** I was wondering where you were taking me\. A cakery\?  
**Akira:** What's wrong with that\? The limited run parfaits this place makes get a lot of talk for being good\.  
**Yomi:** You still like parfaits like you used to\.  
**Yomi:** So, what was the reason you called me here for\?  
**Akira:** I had a little something to take care of around here\. So I thought I'd give you a call\. It's no fun eating by yourself, right\?  
**Yomi:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Akira:** I know you've probably got a lot going on too, but you've gotta take a breather every now and then\.  
**Yomi:** I have to be part of a promotional photo shoot later today, so I can't stay here for very long\.  
**Akira:** Huhh\? What're you doing a photo shoot for\?  
**Yomi:** You could say it has to do with the results of the Miss Five Traditions competition that was held the other day, I suppose\.  
**Akira:** Ahh, oh yeah, they put those out, huh\.  
**Akira:** That reminds me, didn't you place pretty high yourself\? I was surprised to hear it\. I never thought you'd be up there\.  
**Akira:** Though, it must be boring as hell to sit through some photo shoot cause of it\.  
**Yomi:** I can't neglect this, considering it's part of my duties as a toji\.  
**Akira:** You got so straight laced\. But, if that's what you're set on\. You better do it right\.  
**Akira:** You gonna be doing it in your uniform\? They'd probably get mad if you wore something too casual; so a jacket like mine's out\.  
**Yomi:** You're probably right\. Though, this time it's arranged for me to wear a valkyrie themed costume, along with Tsubakuro-san and the others\.  
**Akira:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Akira:** What're you talking about\?  
**Yomi:** You may not know about it, Akira, but valkyries were something that was part of Norse mythology--  
**Akira:** It's not like I don't know what valkyries are\.\.\.\! I'm asking, why're they making you dress up like that\.\.\.\!\?  
**Yomi:** That's what I'd like to know\.  
**Akira:** Yeah, I guess\.\.\. The bureau does say to do some ridiculous stuff sometimes, huh\.  
**Akira:** \.\.\.Well, do what you can\. Whatever you're buying here'll be my treat\.  
**Yomi:** Then, I'll have some tea\. The black tea here is fairly good; it goes well with sweet foods\.  
**Akira:** I'll have the same thing you're drinking then\.  
**Akira:** Ah, when you get the photos back, lemme see\. Those'll be fun to look through for sure\.  

## [Valkyrie - Yomi: End\]: This One is My Favorite
**Akira:** Yo\! It's rare for you to call me to hang out\.  
**Yomi:** I got the photos back from that photo shoot we spoke about the other day\.  
**Yomi:** I think they'll be published online soon, but I had heard you were coming by on an assignment\.  
**Akira:** Cool; let me just put my bike away\. Wait here a minute\.  
**Akira:** So, how'd that photo shoot turn out anyway\?  
**Yomi:** Like this\.  
**Akira:** Whoa-\!\? The hell\.\.\. You're looking way too cool in this\.  
**Akira:** That sharp look on your face is great\. It came out really damn nice\.  
**Yomi:** I didn't expect you to praise it so much\.  
**Akira:** Why not\? Of course I would if it turned out this good\.  
**Yomi:** That's true\. Though, I expected you to make fun of me\.  
**Akira:** Yeah, if I'm being honest, I was planning to, until I actually saw this\. This whole valkyrie thing came out of nowhere\.  
**Akira:** But this seems like it'll get some attention\. Especially if Tsubakuro Yume and Kanami and the others are doing it\.  
**Akira:** You got any other shots of you in this\?  
**Yomi:** No\. This is the only one I brought with me\.  
**Akira:** That's too bad\. I really like the look of this one\.  
**Yomi:** I see\. I wasn't sure which photo to bring myself, so the others in the special defense team picked it out for me\.  
**Akira:** Huh\. Didn't think you were so close with them, Yomi\.  
**Akira:** Does that mean you're pushing omusubi on them too\?  
**Yomi:** Sometimes\.\.\. I do\.  
**Akira:** The omusubi you make are weirdly good, y'know\. Somehow, just talking about them made me hungry\.  
**Akira:** I'm thinking of getting something to eat here, but, what about you\?  
**Yomi:** I'd like to join you, but I've already made plans\.  
**Akira:** With the special defense team\?  
**Yomi:** Yes\.  
**Akira:** Guess there's no helping that\. We didn't get to see each other much, but I had fun today\.  
**Yomi:** I did too\. Then, until next time\.  
**Akira:** She's working real hard for her buddies, huh\.  
**Akira:** Alright\.\.\. I've gotta stick to it too\.
