## [Pajama - Kaoru: Start]: Isn't It Fine Every Once in a While?
**Ellen:** That's the last one\! It's coming your way, Kiyoka\!  
**Kiyoka:** Right\!  
**Ellen:** Good\! Nice work\!  
**Kaoru:** Good going-.  
**Kaoru:** Though, this whole thing took longer than I expected.  
**Kiyoka:** If we don't hurry, we won't make it back before the day's over.  
**Kaoru:** ...Couldn't we just not go back?  
**Kiyoka:** Eh?  
**Ellen:** Are you planning on running away from home, Kaoru?  
**Kaoru:** That's not what I mean.  
**Kaoru:** If we run all the way back to town now, then get on a train, what time'll it be when we get there?  
**Ellen:** That's true; it would be very late.  
**Kaoru:** And what do we do when we're hungry now? Get a beef bowl in front of the station and head home?  
**Kaoru:** I'm not... gonna take that\!  
**Kiyoka:** S-So assertive...\!  
**Ellen:** What you're saying makes some sense, Kaoru.  
**Ellen:** So basically, you think we should stay the night here?  
**Kaoru:** Exactly. It's fine every once in a while, right?  
**Kiyoka:** I do feel like I'd rather rest a little here than hurry back.  
**Kaoru:** Right? Even toji need a break.  
**Ellen:** If that's what we've decided on, then leave the hotel reservations to me-\! I'll call a friend of mine-\!  
**Kiyoka:** A friend who will reserve us a hotel room...?  
**Kaoru:** She's got a lot of weird friends, so don't think too hard about it.  
**Kaoru:** I'm all filled up\~.  
**Ellen:** You sound like an old man, Kaoru.  
**Kiyoka:** But, it really was delicious. You'll have to thank your friend for me, Ellen-san, for telling us about this restaurant\!  
**Ellen:** I'll be sure to let them know-\! Now then, about the hotel... It's this way.  
**Kiyoka:** What kind of hotel is it?  
**Kaoru:** It's probably some little place tucked away-.  
**Kiyoka:** That's what the place we ate at was like, wasn't it.  
**Ellen:** Ah, I can see it. It's that hotel there-\!  
**Kaoru:** Which one... Eh?  
**Kiyoka:** Umm, you mean... that high class looking hotel?  
**Ellen:** Yes\!  

## [Pajama - Kaoru: End]: Pajama Party\!
**Ellen:** Tah-dah-\! We all have matching pajamas\!  
**Kiyoka:** These pajamas are cute\! Though...  
**Kiyoka:** (Since we're wearing the same pajamas, the difference in chest size is...)  
**Kaoru:** (That face says she's getting overwhelmed by the difference in Ellen's assets.)  
**Kiyoka:** No, that's not it. Those are just pectoral muscles... Those are just pectoral muscles...)  
**Kaoru:** (Kiyoka, this'll go a lot easier if you just don't think about it...)  
**Ellen:** What about pectoral muscles?  
**Kaoru:** She's probably wondering how to train 'em, right?  
**Ellen:** If you want to train up your pecs, I think it'd be good to ask Makimaki about it.  
**Kiyoka:** ...That's true; Shidou-san's like that too...  
**Kaoru:** Anyway, how about we get to sleep.  
**Ellen:** Since we're having a pajama party, we have to do a pillow fight and talk about love interests\!  
**Kaoru:** Huh?  
**Kiyoka:** I'm not sure if that's right, but I'm interested in talking about love too\!  
**Kiyoka:** When you become a high schooler, do you really start getting into that kind of thing\!\?  
**Kaoru:** Nah, not really.  
**Ellen:** We're too busy with missions, after all.  
**Kiyoka:** That's disappointing...  
**Ellen:** Now then, all that's left is a pillow fight\!  
**Kaoru:** Count me out-. I'm going to bed already, so don't wake me up-.  
**Ellen:** You're not doing that-\! Hiyah\!  
**Kaoru:** Whoa\!\? ...Don't hit me in the back of the head\!  
**Ellen:** I'm laser accurate\!  
**Kaoru:** Damnit, Ellen... Help me out with her, Kiyoka\!  
**Kiyoka:** E-Err... Here\!  
**Ellen:** Hesitate like that and you'll never hit me\!  
**Kaoru:** You're open\!  
**Kaoru:** Owfh\!\?  
**Ellen:** You're getting serious now, huh Kaoru\! Hyah\!  
**Kaoru:** I can catch something like that easy\! Hahh\!  
**Ellen:** I caught it too\!  
**Kiyoka:** I know we already started throwing them, but... is it really alright for us to have a pillow fight in a hotel like... Afwh\!\?  
**Kaoru:** Hahaha\! Never let your guard down, Kiyoka.  
**Kiyoka:** Why do you look like you're having the most fun with this, Kaoru-san\!

## [Marching - Mai: Start]: Minoseki's Marching Band
**Mai:** Excuse me.  
**Ema:** I've been waiting to see you, Yanase-san.  
**Ema:** Actually, we've gotten a request for the Minoseki Academy's toji to perform in a marching band.  
**Mai:** A marching band... Like, one that plays wind instruments?  
**Ema:** Yes, that kind of marching band. And, that's where I'd like you to be the drum major... In other words, you'll be the conductor of the band.  
**Mai:** You want me to do that...?  
**Ema:** Yes. I think it would be a good experience for you. How do you feel about it?  
**Mai:** ......  
**Mai:** (A conductor... Can I really do it? I'm not so sure, but... the president must be suggesting this because she's sure I can.)  
**Mai:** ...Alright then. I'll take on the role of the drum major\!  
**Mai:** So now, we'll begin practicing.  
**Mai:** ......  
**Kanami:** (Here I do it like this, and then like this... Okay\!)  
**Mihono:** (Here's where I move over here...)  
**Nagae Futaba:** Hey\!\?  
**Mihono/Futaba:** UWAH\!\?  
**Futuba:** Why'd you run into me-\!\?  
**Mihono:** S-Sorry-\!  
**Mai:** Are you okay, Mihono-chan, Nagae-san\!\?  
**Mihono:** I'm fine. And anyway, sorry, Mai. I screwed up again.  
**Mai:** It's alright; we still have time. I'll stick with you, so let's practice lots, okay?  
**Mihono:** Sure\!  
**Mai:** That's enough practicing for today. You did great, everyone\!  
**Everyone:** Good work-\!  
**Mihono:** Ahh, I'm beat\! Let's go get something sweet to eat, Mai, Kanami\!  
**Kanami:** Yeah, okay.  
**Mai:** Ah, sorry, Mihono-chan. I have something to take care of...  
**Mihono:** Oh... That's too bad.  
**Kanami:** We'll see you tomorrow then, Mai-chan\!  
**Mai:** Sure\!  
**Mihono:** Wanna come too, Futaba-?  
**Futaba:** I'll pass\!  
**Mai:** Everyone's gone, so now I need to do my own practice.  
**Mai:** ......  
**Mai:** (They're all practicing their hardest. I have to try even harder too\!)  
**Mai:** --I messed up\! I won't make it like this... One more try\!  
**Mihono:** Ughh, I messed up a bunch, Kanamiii. I made a lot of trouble for Mai too.  
**Kanami:** But still, you've gotten a lot better, Mihono-chan.  
**Mihono:** You think so\!\?  
**Kanami:** Yeah\!  
**Mihono:** Then, that's good to hear\! She's taught how to do a whole lot, so I want to make sure the main performance is a success for sure.  
**Kanami:** Mai-chan's trying so hard for this. I'm sure she's probably practicing right now too.  
**Mihono:** ...Ah, if she's teaching me this stuff, that must mean she practiced it enough to learn it that well herself.  
**Mihono:** ...Sorry, Kanami\! I'm going to go back and practice with Mai too\!  
**Kanami:** I had a feeling you'd say something like that\! I'll go with you.  
**Mihono:** Okay\!  

## [Marching - Mai: End]: What They Saw
At the marching band's main performance.

  
**Mai:** ......  
**Kanami:** Mai-chan?  
**Mai:** Ah, Kanami-chan...  
**Kanami:** Feeling nervous?  
**Mai:** ...Just a bit.  
**Kanami:** It'll go fine.  
**Mai:** You're right. Everyone tried so hard during practice, after all...  
**Kanami:** That's why we'll definitely pull this off.  
**Mai:** ...  
**Mai:** How can... you be so sure?  
**Kanami:** That's cause everybody knows by now. Just how much effort you've been putting into this.  
**Mai:** How much I have...?  
**Kanami:** Yeah. You've been trying so hard that it made everybody else work even harder.  
**Mai:** They did...  
**Kanami:** That's why I just know this'll go great. So let's have fun with it\!  
**Mai:** Okay\!  
**Fukuda Sawano:** (There's so many people here to watch. Though, if we just do it like we practiced...)  
**Futaba:** (Yeah, yeah, all that practice is paying off\!)  
**Mihono:** (Here's where I have to not bump into Futaba... Okay\!)  
**Kanami:** (You can really tell how much everybody practiced\! I'm not about to let them show me up either\!)  
**Mai:** (That's amazing...\! Everyone's performance is even better than what they could do in practice\!)  
**Mai:** Nice work, everyone\! Our performance was fantastic\!  
**Mihono:** That was so nerve-wracking\!  
**Futaba:** So many people came to see us\!  
**Sawano:** It looked like they were even broadcasting it online.  
**Mihono:** Ehh\!\?  
**Kanami:** Mai-chan, everybody sent you messages.  
**Mai:** Eh? Ah, you're right\! I got a message from Sayaka-chan saying, "That was great."  
**Mai:** And there's ones from Ellen-chan and Kaoru-chan and everyone too... Fufu.  
**Kanami:** See, I told you we'd pull it off.  
**Mai:** You did, Kanami-chan\!

## [Valkyrie - Kanami: Start]: Let's Do a Survey
**Kanami:** Promotional photos?  
**Mai:** Yep, promotional photos.  
**Mai:** They say it's to extend the scope of activities for those who were chosen in the Miss Five Traditions contest, so we'll all be taking them.  
**Kaoru:** What a pain-.  
**Kaoru:** They could just use the photos on our IDs for that.  
**Sayaka:** Would ID photos work?  
**Mai:** ...That definitely wouldn't work, would it?  
**Mai:** And, about that, I have a photo studio I'd prefer to use, so could we all take our pictures there?  
**Hiyori:** Sure, that sounds nice.  
**Ellen:** Wait just a moment----\!\!  
**Kaoru:** ...Where'd you even come from.  
**Ellen:** I heard the whole thing\!  
**Sayaka:** Were you eavesdropping?  
**Ellen:** You're making me sound bad, Saaya\!  
**Ellen:** And anyway, since you have this chance to take promotional photos, it wouldn't be any fun to take any everyday kind of picture\!  
**Mai:** This is a proper activity we were tasked to do, so isn't it fine if it's not fun?  
**Ellen:** That's a no, Maimai\!  
**Ellen:** The mission of Miss Five Traditions was to help cheer up people across the world\!  
**Ellen:** Which means, we need to come up for something starting with this photo shoot\!  
**Kanami:** You know... I think Ellen-chan might be right\!  
**Hiyori:** ...Are you really okay with this?  
**Kaoru:** Don't get won over by her smooth talking. She's just here to amuse herself.  
**Kanami:** That's still fine\! I don't think what Ellen-chan's saying is wrong.  
**Ellen:** I knew I could count on you, Kanamin\!  
**Ellen:** So then... Let's start right off with a survey over the internet\!  
**Ellen:** Kanamin's promotional shots will be her in... These\!  
**Ellen:** An aradama hoodie, a Nenegurumi, or a valkyrie costume\!  
**Kaoru:** None of those are good for promotional shots\!  
**Mai:** But... They might look cute.  
**Sayaka:** Mm, I want to see all of them.  
**Kanami:** Y-You think so?  
**Kaoru:** You guys... Don't come crying to me when it's your turn to put that on.  
**Hiyori:** Me either.  
**Hiyori:** Since I'll be having my photos taken at Mai's studio.  

## [Valkyrie - Kanami: End]: All in the Same Boat?
**Ellen:** We got the results back from Kanamin's survey\!  
**Kanami:** It's so tense...\!  
**Ellen:** They all put up a good fight, but... The winner in the end was the valkyrie costume\!  
**Hiyori:** ...Promotional photos of a valkyrie, huh.  
**Mai:** Ellen-chan, leave making the costume to me\! I'll make the perfect valkyrie costume to match Kanami-chan\!  
**Ellen:** Please do, Maimai\! I'll be in charge of getting the scene ready\!  
**Sayaka:** Mai and Ellen are fired up...  
**Kaoru:** ...Sigh.  
**Kaoru:** So, what're we doing about you two, Sayaka and Mai?  
**Ellen:** We haven't overlooked a thing\! We're coming up with the greatest costume plans for all of you\!  
**Kaoru:** You're doing it for me too\!\?  
**Ellen:** Well of course I am\!  
**Kanami:** (A valkyrie... I can't wait to see what the costume looks like\!)  
Kanami's promotional photos... The day of shooting.

  
**Kanami:** A-Am I... really going to wear this? It sure is revealing around the shoulders and places...  
**Hiyori:** (...I told you so.)  
**Mai:** I think it'll really look nice on you, Kanami-chan\! I'm proud of how it turned out\!  
**Kanami:**  S-Sure... Ellen-chan?  
**Ellen:** It's too late to change anything, Kanamin.  
**Ellen:** The scene is all set too, and we already got approval from the Sword Administration Bureau\!  
**Hiyori:** That's why I warned you.  
**Kanami:** I should've listened to you, Hiyori-chan...  
**Kaoru:** It's alright, Kanami. Everybody here... We all got dragged into this with you.  
**Kanami:** Kaoru-chan...  
**Hiyori:** (I already finished taking mine though.)  
**Sayaka:** Kanami. Mai got it ready for you, so I'm sure you'll look good.  
**Kanami:** Y-Yeah... Y-You're right...  
**Sayaka:** ?  
**Staff:** We've finished setting up for the shoot-\! Etou-san, we're all ready for you-\!  
**Kanami:** ...Alright\!  
**Kanami:** So then, these are my promotional shots...  
**Mai:** Kanami-chan\! You look so cute\!  
**Hiyori:** ...Yeah, the photos do have an atmosphere to them.  
**Kanami:** The cameraman was so good that I started really having fun with getting my pictures taken.  
**Kanami:** And, I think that really came through with how good they look\!  
**Sayaka:** Kanami, you're making a nice face.  
**Sayaka:** So this is a promotional photo...  
**Ellen:** See, everyone's loving it\! What about you, Kaoru?  
**Kaoru:** Yeah, yeah, I was wrong. I think it's pretty good.  
**Kaoru:** (Do I gotta cosplay for my promotional shots too...? Sigh.)
