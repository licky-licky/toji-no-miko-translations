## 1: Away to Choshi
**TV (Reporter\):** The submarine thought to be carrying Ichikishimahime is currently sailing in the waters off the Boso Peninsula\!  
**TV (Reporter\):** From here, we will watch as the self-defense force captures the submarine and apprehends Ichikishimahime\!  
**Mihono:** Wh-What's going on\.\.\.\? Why is the self-defense force going after the submarine Yukari-sama and Ichikishimahime are on\.\.\.\?  
**Mirja:** It's highly likely that President Takatsu has been influencing things behind closed doors\.  
**Kiyoka:** Then, President Takatsu got close to government officials so she could get the self-defense force involved\.\.\.\?  
**Kofuki:** I don't get all the details, but the important part is, we're in trouble, right\?  
**Chie:** We are\.\.\. If the self-defense force captures Ichikishimahime, they're sure to send her to Tagitsuhime\.  
**Chie:** And, after absorbing her, Tagitsuhime will have fully returned to her old self\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** But then\.\.\. There has to be something we can do to help\.\.\.  
**Akane:** --Excuse me\. Are all the members of the investigation team present here\?  
**Chie:** We are\. We were all just watching what's happening on TV\.  
**Akane:** Good, that makes this quicker\. I have new orders for you\.  
**Akane:** Please depart for Choshi at once, to provide aid for Origami Yukari and Ichikishimahime\.  
**Chie:** Choshi\? They said on TV that the submarine is sailing by the Boso Peninsula\.\.\.  
**Akane:** Yukari and Ichikishimahime escaped in a life boat, and have already landed in Choshi Bay\.  
**Akane:** The imperial guard are searching the area though, and it is only a matter of time before they're found\.  
**Akane:** Which is why I want all of you going to rescue them\. Kanami-san, Hiyori-san, Maki-san, and Suzuka-san have already left for Choshi\.  
**Mirja:** I understand the situation\. However, Choshi is quite far from here\. Even in a speeding car it could still take over three hours\.\.\.  
**Akane:** I know, which is why I've prepared a helicopter for you\.  
**Kofuki:** For real\!\? Now things are getting exciting\!  

## 2: The Strength of Yukari (1\)
**Yukina:** --Princess, you'll be glad to hear this\. We've found where Ichikishimahime landed after disappearing from the submarine\.  
**Yukina:** Though, there is no need for you to go out, Princess\. I will have Ichikishimahime brought here to you\.  
**Tagitsu:** Will you\? Then I will wait, for now\.  
**Yukina:** Of course\. I promise, I will bring back good news\.  
--At that time, on Choshi Bridge\.

  
**Imperial Guard A:** Sh-She's too much\.\.\.\!\!  
**Imperial Guard B:** This is what it's like, to fight Origami Yukari\.\.\.\!\!  
**Yukari:** --Taking in noro can bring out your potential strength, but it can't teach you to fight a real battle\.  
**Yukari:** The imperial guard cannot stop me\. This is reckless of you, Yukina\.  
**Imperial Guard A:** D-Don't let her get to you\! Attack-\!  

## 3: The Strength of Yukari (2\)
**Imperial Guard A:** Ggh\.\.\. Ghah\.\.\.  
**Ichikishima:** Have you dealt with them all\?  
**Yukari:** If you would draw Juzumaru, we would have an easier time breaking through here\.  
**Ichikishima:** A momentary victory has no meaning\.\.\.  
**Ichikishima:** Yukari, I am tired\.  
**Ichikishima:** Abandoned by both Tagitsuhime and Takirihime, I remain in this world alone\.\.\.  
**Yukari:** If you can talk that much, you're doing fine\. We're moving\.  
**Ichikishima:** You slave driver\.\.\.  

## 4: The Search is On\! (1\)
**Mihono:** We got to Choshi in no time\! That's a helicopter for you\!  
**Kiyoka:** But now, which way should we be going\.\.\.\?ã€€  
**Mirja:** Though we're here to rescue them, we don't have an accurate idea of Ichikishimahime's current position\.  
**Kofuki:** Ichikishimahime's an aradama-chan, so can't we track her down with the spectrum finder\?  
**Mirja:** Unfortunately, due to the high concentration of aradama in the area, our spectrum finders won't be of any use\.  
**Chie:** Couldn't we call Yukari-sama and ask her directly\?  
**Mirja:** Origami Yukari-sama seems to have powered off her phone\. There is a possibility that her phone's signal could broadcast her location to President Takatsu, after all\.  
**Chie:** Then that means, until we get an idea of where to go, we're waiting here\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** We can't just stand around\! Let's follow our intuition for now\!  
**Kiyoka:** Your intuition\? Hono-chan\.\.\.  
**Kofuki:** Nah, I'm with Mihocchi here\. Let's go around wiping out every aradama-chan the spectrum finders pick up\!  
**Kofuki:** --Or I'd like to at least, but first, we've got company\.  
**Mihono:** Huh\.\.\.\? --Ahh\! The imperial guard\!  
**Imperial Guard A:** We came to investigate the landing of an unknown helicopter, and if it isn't the infamous investigation team\.  
**Imperial Guard B:** I'm sure you came hoping to rescue Ichikishimahime, but we aren't about to allow it\!  

## 5: The Search is On\! (2\)
**Kofuki:** Now that the party crashers are dealt with, let's follow Mihocchi's intuition all the way to Ichikishimahime\!  
**Chie:** But, couldn't it make things worse if we move around carelessly\.\.\.\?  
**Mirja:** I checked with Origami Akane-sama just now\. It sounds as though she's already taken that into consideration\.  
**Mirja:** However, the government is watching closely, so she has asked us to cause as little of a commotion as possible\.  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.As well as that, if we encounter any imperial guard during our search, we should expect to fight again\. Please be prepared\.  
**Mihono:** Understood\! We should get moving then\!  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.Yes, I agree\.  
**Kiyoka:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** (\.\.\.Mirja-san noticed\. That during that fight with the imperial guard, I still hesitated\.\.\.\)  
**Kiyoka:** (No\.\.\. I'm fine\. I'll be fine\. I made a promise\. Where there's a will, there's a way\.\.\.\)  

## 6: Princess of Denial (1\)
**Yukari:** Phew\.\.\.  
**Ichikishima:** So even you get tired\.  
**Yukari:** After the constant series of attacks from the imperial guard, anyone would\.  
**Ichikishima:** The imperial guard\.\.\. All their attacks so far, to offer me to Tagitsuhime\?  
**Ichikishima:** What great lengths they go to\.\.\.  
**Imperial Guard A:** --There they are\!\! It's Origami Yukari and Ichikishimahime\!  
**Imperial Guard B:** Don't let them get away\!  
**Yukari:** Another wave then\.  
**Ichikishima:** Yukari, will you still fight\?  
**Yukari:** That goes without saying\.  
**Yukari:** As for you, are you still not going to draw Juzumaru\?  
**Ichikishima:** I told you before, did I not\. A temporary victory is meaningless\. I've grown tired\.  
**Yukari:** I see\. Then keep quiet and stand there\.  

## 6: Princess of Denial (2\)
**Ichikishima:** \.\.\.Sigh\.  
**Yukari:** What are you sighing for now\?  
**Ichikishima:** Pity, for the imperial guard acting as tools for Tagitsuhime\.  
**Ichikishima:** After searching for one as worthless as myself, only to be beaten about by Yukari, I cannot help but pity them\.  
**Yukari:** \.\.\.At the very least, Tagitsuhime thinks you're worth enough to order her guard to capture you\.  
**Yukari:** Is there nothing you can do about that self-defeating attitude of yours\?  
**Ichikishima:** There is nothing to be done\.  
**Ichikishima:** In contrast to Tagitsuhime of vengeance and Takirihime of dominance, I am only Ichikishimahime of denial\.  
**Yukari:** That's the first I've heard of those titles\.\.\.  

## 7: The Place We Should Go Is (1\)
**Kofuki:** Come on, Mihocchi's intuition, show us the way to Yukari-sama and Ichikishimahime\!  
**Mihono:** My intuition can't handle the pressure\.\.\. At least let me find a hint or something\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** I was just thinking, could we not get information from the imperial guard searching in the area\?  
**Mirja:** We can also discover how aware the imperial guard are of Ichikishimahime's movements, which would be two birds with one stone\.  
**Chie:** Mirja-san, that's a great idea\.  
**Kofuki:** But, how do we get the imperial guard to tell us anything\? Are we gonna torture them\?  
**Kiyoka:** Don't suggest something so scary\.\.\.  
**Chie:** --\!\! Everyone, there's some imperial guard over that way\. Let's hide for a moment and listen to what they're saying\.  
**Imperial Guard A:** --The ones who arrived before us still haven't managed to capture Ichikishimahime\?  
**Imperial Guard B:** It appears that the guards who went to secure her have all been defeated by Origami Yukari\.  
**Imperial Guard C:** That means, even having lost Tagitsuhime-sama's power, Origami Yukari is still going strong\.  
**Imperial Guard C:** In that case, where should we go\?  
**Imperial Guard B:** After Origami Yukari and Ichikishima landed on Choshi's beach, they seem to have continued heading north\.  
**Kofuki:** \.\.\.Get a load of these idiots\. Just sharing important info where anybody can hear\.  
**Kiyoka:** Kofuki-san, don't badmouth them\.\.\.  
**Kofuki:** So since they knew where Yukari-sama's going, now all we have to do is beat 'em up and go north\.  
**Kiyoka:** Eh-\!\? We're going to fight them now\!\?  
**Kofuki:** Duh, of course we are\.  
**Mihono:** Yeah, I agree with Fukki\. Their goal is to catch Ichikishimahime, so sooner or later we're going to have to fight them anyway\.  
**Mihono:** And it'll be easier if we attack them now, before they can group up with the other guards\.  
**Mirja:** You two have the right idea\.  
**Mihono:** Okay then, everybody, let's go\!  

## 8: The Place We Should Go Is (2\)
**Chie:** Phew\.\.\. Thank goodness we defeated them safely\.  
**Mirja:** They said that Origami Yukari-sama was headed north from Choshi beach\.  
**Mirja:** Taking that into consideration, what do you say we move to Kashima north of Choshi, and begin searching our way south from there\?  
**Kiyoka:** I think that might work\.  
**Mihono:** Good thing they knew Yukari-sama's route\. Thinking about it, there's no way following my intuition would get us anywhere\.\.\.  
**Kofuki:** But hey, once we get to Kashima, we might actually have to count on it for real to help us find Ichikishimahime\.  
**Mihono:** Uugh\.\.\. I never should've brought it up in the first place\.\.\.  

## 9: An Elite Guard of Only Three (1\)
**Yume:** Here we gooo\! The three of us are gonna save Yukari-sama-\!  
**Maki:** Yume\.\.\. Even if you forced your way out of the hospital, will you really be okay\?  
**Suzuka:** The situation may be dire enough to need everything we can offer, but you have to be mindful of your condition\.  
**Yume:** I'll be fine\! Besides, there's no way I could sit around at a time like this\!  
**Yume:** And anyway, is there really any point in me staying in the hospital\? Yeah I cough sometimes, but I'm not sick, right\?  
**Yume:** The doctor's are all confused too, cause they don't know which way to treat me\.  
**Maki:** You're not wrong\.\.\. They can give you an IV when you have no appetite, and blood transfusions when you get anemic, but there's no treatment for the underlying problem\.  
**Maki:** What's seems to be behind most of your suffering is that the soul of yours we got back from the netherworld still hasn't adapted to your body yet\.  
**Yume:** Hmm\.\.\. So does it have something to do with the noro still in my body\?  
**Maki:** I don't think there's any way it's not related\.  
**Suzuka:** It's due to the aradama power you were given that you could be recovered from the netherworld, but it also brought you this hardship\.\.\.  
**Suzuka:** Though, Maki-san and I can hardly speak as bystanders\.  
**Suzuka:** The noro continues to remain within our bodies as well\.  
**Maki:** That's right\. There's still too many mysteries surrounding noro\. Something could always go wrong with our bodies too\.  
**Maki:** Of course, when we were injected with noro, we were prepared for that, but--  
**Aradama:** SHAAAAAAAAAAAA\!  
**Yume:** Aha-\! Onee-sans\! An aradama showed up\! That's a pretty unlucky aradama, running into us like that, huh\!  
**Suzuka:** It certainly is\. We hardly have the time, so let's dispose of it at once\.  

## 10: An Elite Guard of Only Three (2\)
**Yume:** It's been so long since I got to have fun fighting aradama with you two-\!  
**Maki:** Seeing the way you fought just now, it's looking like we worried about you for nothing\.  
**Suzuka:** I'll say\. Though, if anything begins to feel wrong to you, tell us at once, understand\?  
**Yume:** I know what to do by now\. You worry too much, Suzuka-onee-san\.  
**Maki:** Good, then let's keep going\.  
**Yume:** Okaaay\! Just you wait, Yukari-sama-\!  
**Yume:** (\.\.\.It's okay\. It doesn't hurt that bad\. I can handle it\. There's no way I was just going to sit tight in the hospital\.\.\.\!\!\)  

## 11: Let's Talk (1\)
**Ichikishima:** \.\.\.I have grown tired of running\.  
**Ichikishima:** I may as well submit myself and be absorbed into Tagitsuhime\.\.\.  
**Yukari:** If you have the leisure to make stupid suggestions, then you should be moving your feet\.  
**Yukari:** When you split off from Tagitsuhime, you had a desire you wanted accomplished, didn't you\. Are you fine with dying leaving that undone\?  
**Ichikishima:** A desire\.\.\.  
**Ichikishima:** I desired to sublimate humanity to greater heights through fusion with aradama, at one point\.  
**Ichikishima:** But none would desire such lofty ideals\.\.\.  
**Ichikishima:** I had hoped to prove my existence was not unnecessary\.\.\. But I am tired\.  
**Yukari:** Then you're giving up\?  
**Ichikishima:** None around me will forgive me\.  
**Yukari:** I see\. Though that means nothing to me\.  
**Yukari:** Whether or not anyone forgives you, I made up my mind to protect you\.  
**Yukari:** Even if they all wanted otherwise, I would never give you to Tagitsuhime\.  
**Ichikishima:** Yukari\.\.\.  
**Imperial Guard A:** Everyone, target sighted\! It's Origami Yukari and Ichikishimahime\!\!  
**Imperial Guard B:** Circle around them, so they can't escape\! Don't give them anywhere to run\! Make sure we're the ones to bring her in\!  

## 12: Let's Talk (2\)
**Yukari:** All the imperial guard in our surroundings have been dealt with\. We can get some rest at last\.  
**Ichikishima:** \.\.\.I cannot understand\. Why won't you break\?  
**Ichikishima:** For these twenty years, we were with you\. And yet, as we wore away at you, you endured it all\.  
**Ichikishima:** From where do you find it\? That strength of yours\?  
**Yukari:** You want to know\? Then I'll tell you\.  
**Yukari:** You won't be able to understand just by watching, so speak with me\.  
**Ichikishima:** Communicating intent through conversation\.\.\.\?  
**Yukari:** As you've said, humanity is immature\. Thinking we can understand each other without conversation is nonsense\.  
**Yukari:** From speaking with you\.\.\. For example, I was surprised to find how unexpectedly talkative you are\.  
**Yukari:** I thought you would be the silent type\.\.\. Frankly, I was puzzled at first\.  
**Ichikishima:** Mm\.\.\.  
**Yukari:** I'm not very good at it myself, but this is how humans come to understand each other\.  
**Yukari:** --Though, saying that, it can be a problem when someone comes to understand you too well\.  
**Yukari:** Only you could have traced me this far\. --Yuzuki\.  
**Yuzuki:** \.\.\.Only because you're easy to figure out, Yukari\.  
**Other:** Justified Scrutiny  
**Yume:** Come on, onee-sans\! I'm gonna leave you behind with how slow you're going-\! Yukari-sama might get mad if you keep her waiting-\!  
**Maki:** \.\.\.Suzuka\.  
**Suzuka:** I know\. She's not yet in good shape\.  
**Maki:** But who knows what she'd get up to if we forced her to rest\.  
**Suzuka:** She's quite the troublemaker, isn't she\.  
**Maki:** It actually feels better having her where I can see her\. Especially at a time like this\.  
**Suzuka:** Though it's true that her health is coming back to her\. This is a good chance to see how well she's recovered\.  
**Maki:** You have a point\. But we have to make sure we don't lose sight of her\.  
**Suzuka:** Naturally\. What a handful she can be, honestly\. Fufufu\.
