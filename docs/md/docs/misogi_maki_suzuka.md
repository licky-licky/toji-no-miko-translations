## [Misogi - Maki: Start\]: Maki's Habit
**Maki:** Give me a status report\!  
**Toji A:** Unit #1 collapsed after being hit with an enemy ambush\!  
**Maki:** An ambush\.\.\.\? This platoon maneuvers training only just started though\!\?  
**Toji B:** Still, we've confirmed it\! We tried sending backup immediately, but by the time they got there, they were already unable to fight\!  
**Maki:** Kgh\.\.\.  
**Maki:** (Did Suzuka predict the orders I'd give\? Then that'd mean\.\.\.\)  
**Maki:** It's dangerous staying here too\.\.\. We're moving\!  
**Toji:** Shidou-san\! It's an ambush\!  
**Maki:** Huh\!\? Another ambush\.\.\.\? But then they'd have to know we'd come this way\!\?  
**Toji B:** We'll open a path for you\! \.\.\.Don't let them get Shidou-san\!  
**Toji A:** Leave her to me\! Shidou-san, over this way\!  
**Maki:** I didn't think this would end up being so one-sided\.  
**Toji A:** I'm sorry, Shidou-san; we just weren't strong enough for them\.\.\.  
**Maki:** \.\.\.No, none of you did anything wrong\. They were just one step ahead of us\.  
**Maki:** (I never thought she'd have such a good read on me\.\.\.\)  
**Toji A:** There's only me and a few others left\.\.\. What should we do\?  
**Maki:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Maki:** (Regrouping from this would be almost impossible\.\.\. All that's left is\.\.\.\)  
**Maki:** I'll go out there\. We're just too outnumbered right now\.\.\. I'm the only one who could this around\.  
**Toji A:** Alright\.\.\. Good luck out there, Shidou-san\.  
**Maki:** Thanks\!  
**\?\?\?:** Shidou Maki started moving independently from the rest\.  
**\?\?\?:** Just as expected\. Mm, I knew you wouldn't be able to resist\.  
**\?\?\?:** Is everyone ready and waiting\?  
**\?\?\?:** Yes\.  
**Suzuka:** \.\.\.This is checkmate, Maki-san\.  
**Suzuka:** Now then, let's begin the review meeting for our platoon skirmish\.  
**Maki:** \.\.\.I got outmatched so badly I can't even tell what I'm supposed to review\.  
**Maki:** Could you tell everything I was thinking, Suzuka\?  
**Suzuka:** From your past tendencies, I could tell you would bring your platoon at us from the front\.  
**Suzuka:** Given our different approaches to leadership, if our platoons were to face each other so directly, I would be at a disadvantage\.  
**Maki:** So that's why you went with an ambush\.  
**Suzuka:** Yes; if I wanted to win, our best plan of action was to come at you from where you were most exposed\.  
**Maki:** You had me completely caught up in it\. Especially with how well you pulled off those last waves of attacks\.  
**Suzuka:** That was the cornerstone to our strategy\. I wouldn't be exaggerating to say everything else was simply to bring you to that point\.  
**Maki:** \.\.\.So you knew I'd do all that\?  
**Suzuka:** That's right\. When your unit finds itself in danger, you always attempt to recover the situation on your own, don't you\?  
**Maki:** \.\.\.Do I\? Wait, now that I think about it, maybe you're right\.\.\.  
**Suzuka:** \.\.\.We'll have to put this review meeting on hold here\.  
**Maki:** Right\.\.\. Let's move out, Suzuka\!  

## [Misogi - Maki: End\]: Somebody I Can't Beat
**Suzuka:** It seems we'll already be able to put today's training to good use\.  
**Maki:** Today's training\.\.\.\? You think we'll have to watch out for any aradama ambushes\?  
**Suzuka:** Well, I wouldn't say it's completely out of the question, would you\?  
**Suzuka:** \.\.\.We're just about to make contact\.  
**Maki:** Why are there so many\!\?  
**Suzuka:** This could take quite some time\.\.\.  
**Toji A:** HAAAAAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Toji A:** Damnit\! After every one we kill, another one comes out\!  
**Toji B:** How long is this going to go on for\.\.\.\?  
**Maki:** (\.\.\.They're already showing signs of fatigue\. At this point, I should\.\.\.\)  
**Suzuka:** That's right\. When your unit finds itself in danger, you always attempt to recover the situation on your own, don't you\?  
**Maki:** (\.\.\.If I did that, there'd be no point to the training\.\.\. But, still\.\.\.\)  
**Suzuka:** \.\.\.It's getting to be rather difficult, isn't it\.  
**Maki:** \.\.\.Yeah\. Everybody's close to their limit\.  
**Suzuka:** What should we do about them\.\.\.  
**Maki:** (If we keep fighting like this\.\.\. we might get overwhelmed by their numbers\.\)  
**Maki:** (And then, what's going to happen to these girls\?\)  
**Maki:** (If that's going to put them in danger\.\.\. I just have to do whatever I can\!\)  
**Maki:** Suzuka\!  
**Suzuka:** Yes\?  
**Maki:** I'm leaving my unit with you\! You'll take good care of them, right\?  
**Suzuka:** Fufu, how very like you, Maki-san\.  
**Maki:** Yeah, it doesn't seem like I can do much else\. So\.\.\. I'm heading off\.  
**Maki:** HAAAAAAAAAAAAAHH\!\!  
**Aradama:** GEEEEEEEEE\!\!  
**Suzuka:** We somehow managed though all that\.  
**Maki:** \.\.\.Sorry, Suzuka\.  
**Suzuka:** What are you apologizing for\?  
**Suzuka:** Many girls were injured, but none of it was serious\. And they all owe it to you\.  
**Maki:** Still, I ended up going off on my own in the end\. That made the whole training meaningless\.  
**Suzuka:** It's true that you should reflect on that, from the perspective of preparing the next generation\.  
**Suzuka:** But, to use yourself as a shield to protect those by your side\.\.\. I think that's one of your best qualities, Maki-san\.  
**Maki:** You\.\.\. do\?  
**Suzuka:** I do\. So, why not learn to operate your unit in your own way\?  
**Maki:** Hmph\! Hmph\! Hmhh\! Hmph\! Huph--\!\!\!  
**Maki:** (Operate in my own way\.\.\. Since I have the day off and I'm done training, I might as well go through some simulations\.\)  
**Suzuka:** You're out here training again\? Don't you think you ought to take the time to rest every so often\?  
**Maki:** Hey, you're the one who said I should keep doing things my own way\.  
**Maki:** I'm not busy today, so I'm going to really think over how to lead around a unit\.  
**Suzuka:** Honestly\.\.\. This is exactly what's no good about you, Maki-san\.  
**Maki:** Weren't you telling me the exact opposite before\!\?  
**Suzuka:** That was then, this is now\.  
**Suzuka:** So go on, shower yourself off\. After you've finished, you can come along with me to an art gallery\.  
**Maki:** \.\.\.I really can't hold a candle to you, can I\.

## [Misogi - Suzuka: Start\]: Someone I Can't Take My Mind Off Of
**Yukari:** Shidou, Konohana, I want the both of you to leave to conduct an inspection tomorrow\.  
**Suzuka:** Will you not be traveling with us, Yukari-sama\?  
**Yukari:** That's right; there's other business I'll have to attend to\. I'd like for you two to handle this\.  
**Yukari:** The details will be sent to you later, but essentially\.\.\.  
**Yukari:** The idea is to have two active duty toji give their perspective on plans made with the railway association to resolve issues dispatching toji to sites of aradama outbreaks\.  
**Maki:** Yes ma'am\!  
**Suzuka:** Understood\.  
**Yukari:** Konohana, after accompanying me to several inspections, you should have an idea of what to do\. Give Shidou your support\.  
**Suzuka:** Certainly\.  
**Maki:** I'll be counting on you\.  
**Suzuka:** (Yukari-sama said to support Maki-san, but, even without me, she likely would have been fine on her own\.\)  
**Maki:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Suzuka:** (Shidou Maki\.\.\. Even before facing each other in the finals of the tournament, I was already aware of her\. Being the owner of that okatana, Usumidori\.\)  
**Suzuka:** (Usumidori has a deep connection to my Kurama-ryu\.\.\. I had expected to inherit it myself one day\. But, it never happened\.\)  
**Suzuka:** (Ever since then, I think\.\.\. I might have been conscious of her\.\)  
**Suzuka:** (And-- then came the tournament where I'd been determined to prove my superiority over her\. Only to be defeated in the end\.\.\. What's worse, it happened two years in a row\.\)  
**Maki:** \.\.\.zuka\?  
**Suzuka:** (Even now, after following her into the elite guard, I can't help but never want to be outdone by her\.\)  
**Maki:** Suzuka\. Um\.\.\. It's awkward, with you staring at me not saying anything\.\.\. If something's bothering you, could you tell me\?  
**Suzuka:** \.\.\.\!\? Ahem\.\.\. I'm very sorry about that\. I was just a bit lost in thought\.  
**Maki:** Oh\.  
**Suzuka:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Maki:** You really helped me out today\. I'm glad you came along\.  
**Suzuka:** \.\.\.Maki-san\?  
**Maki:** Suppressing aradama is one thing, but I still can't get used to this inspection stuff\.  
**Maki:** Even when they go over it for me, I can't come up with a lot more than, \"Ahh, so that's how it is\.\"  
**Maki:** Compared to me, you're incredible\.  
**Suzuka:** Wh-Where is all this coming from\?  
**Maki:** Weren't you asking all the right questions\?  
**Maki:** If it had been just me, I wouldn't have been able to come back with a report that'd make Yukari-sama happy\.  
**Suzuka:** \.\.\.That's the entire reason I was here\. There's no reason for you to be concerned about it\.  
**Suzuka:** More importantly, what are you thinking, flaunting your weakness in front of me like that\?  
**Maki:** \.\.\.What do you mean\?  
**Suzuka:** I'm shocked is all\. You used to be so stubborn, and yet you seem to have grown awfully open minded\.  
**Maki:** You're good with situations like those, right\? Since you know how to look at things from different angles\.  
**Maki:** All I was thinking all day was, I'm really glad someone as reliable as you is with me\.  
**Suzuka:** Wha\.\.\.\!  
**Maki:** I still keep it in mind; how you told me it'd be better if we took on different roles that show the best of our abilities\.  
**Suzuka:** \.\.\.If that's all this is about, then that's fine\.  
**Suzuka:** (Maki-san has been like this ever since we agreed to start calling each other by our first names\.\.\.\)  
**Suzuka:** (\.\.\.It makes me seem strange for being the only one so wary around her\.\.\.\!\)  
**Suzuka:** (Really\.\.\. Maki-san, you're just so\.\.\.\)  

## [Misogi - Suzuka: End\]: Crossing Okatana as a Refresher
**Suzuka:** Maki-san\. You've left a few errors in this paperwork, you know\?  
**Maki:** I did\? Sorry; could I fix it up later\? I'm running short on time\.  
**Suzuka:** It's not an issue\. I've already corrected them for you\.  
**Maki:** Thanks for that\. Anyway, I'd better get going\.  
**Yume:** Hey, hey, Suzuka-onee-san\. Aren't you kinda getting friendlier with Maki-onee-san now\? You are, right\?  
**Suzuka:** Nothing's changed between us in the slightest\.  
**Yume:** Ehh; you're definitely friendlier now\!  
**Suzuka:** (She's not wrong\.\.\. It feels as if there's less distance between Maki-san and myself\.\.\.\)  
**Suzuka:** (But, even so\.\.\. I still want to make up for the losses I suffered to her\.\.\.\)  
**Suzuka:** Sigh\.\.\.  
**Suzuka:** (How can I relieve these pent up feelings\.\.\. It seems I'll have to do something to refresh myself\.\)  
**Maki:** This is the first time we've fought seriously since the tournament, isn't it\?  
**Suzuka:** Thank you very much for accepting my sudden proposal\.  
**Maki:** It's fine by me\.  
**Suzuka:** \.\.\.This time, I'll be victorious\.  
**Maki:** I'm not planning on losing either\.  
**Suzuka:** Good\. There wouldn't be much point if you were\.  
**Maki:** Then, let's get started\. Come at me whenever\.  
**Suzuka:** I'll take you up on that then\!  
**Suzuka:** EII--\!  
**Maki:** Ggh\.\.\. You're especially aggressive today\.  
**Suzuka:** I can't have you thinking\.\.\. I'll only stay the same old Konohana Suzuka--\!\!  
**Maki:** Having you come at me head on's kind of exciting\.  
**Suzuka:** Don't you think\.\.\. you're talking a little too much\?  
**Maki:** You're right; let's leave it at that\. Here I come\.  
**Maki:** --YAAAAAAHH\!  
**Suzuka:** (She really is\.\.\. so strong\! Her strikes so straightforward\.\.\. so heavy\!\)  
**Suzuka:** (Even still, I won't lose\!\)  
**Suzuka:** HAAAAAH\!  
**Maki:** [pant\.\.\. pant\.\.\. pant\.\.\.\]  
**Suzuka:** I'm beaten\.\.\. It's your win\.  
**Maki:** That was a great match\. You really are amazing\. You had me scrambling to keep up; I've never seen you fight like that before\.  
**Maki:** Let's keep getting stronger like that together, to support Yukari-sama\.  
**Suzuka:** (That attitude of hers-- As straightforward as her swordsmanship\. Maybe that's what Usumidori recognized in her\.\)  
**Suzuka:** (This marks my third consecutive defeat\. And yet\.\.\.\)  
**Suzuka:** Of course\. But, someday, I will overtake you\. \.\.\.I hope you won't grow complacent, unless you'd like me to take your precious okatana off your hands\.  
**Maki:** I'm glad for the competition\. I won't be losing either; I'll show you how strong I can get\.  
**Suzuka:** Take good care of Usumidori for me\.  
**Maki:** Course I will\. That's my trusty partner you're talking about\.
