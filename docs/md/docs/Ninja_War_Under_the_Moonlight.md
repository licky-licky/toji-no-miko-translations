## 1: Ninja War Outbreak: Steal the Secret Letter
**Hamatsuka Sakura:** M-M-M-Makizou-sama, Suzusuke-sama, s-something terrible... Something terrible has happened\!\!  
**Maki:** Get a hold of yourself\! As ninja in the service of Yukari-sama, we Origami ninja must always be calm and collected.  
**Sakura:** I-I'm... Very sorry...  
**Suzuka:** Now then, what happened?  
**Sakura:** That's, ninja from another territory seem to have infiltrated our ninja mansion. Their target is likely...  
**Sakura:** That "secret letter", I believe.  
**Maki:** What are the guards doing, allowing the enemy to slip through? If they're that negligent, I'll have to re-discipline them later.  
**Suzuka:** However, Makizou-dono, we do have a bit of spare time. A round of rat hunting might be amusing.  
**Maki:** A rat hunt...? You may be on to something, Suzusuke-dono.  
**Maki:** If they're skilled enough to invade here, they may prove useful in killing time... We'll see.  
Meanwhile, on the other side--

  
**Kofuki:** Damnit, why do I have to play along with this dumb stuff? What moron came up with "Mokusa ninja"\!  
**Kiyoka:** P-Please calm down, Kofukimaru-san. If you make too much noise, the enemy will find us.  
**Kofuki:** And who do you think you're calling Kofukimaru?  
**Kiyoka:** Please calm down, that's just how it is. We've come this far, so please give up and accept it.  
**Kofuki:** I'm no good at giving up\!  
**Kofuki:** Anyway, you're acting pretty weird. Can't believe you actually volunteered for this stupid job.  
**Kiyoka:** Ehh\~, it seemed like a lot of fun.  
**Kofuki:** No good... You and I are on totally different channels. I'm not into this kind of game.  
**Kofuki:** And since I'm not into it, can I drop the act and just call it quits here?  
**Kiyoka:** You can't do that. We're not allowed to go back until the mission is over, Shichinosato-san. Ahh, I didn't mean that\! ...Kofukimaru-san\!  
**Kofuki:** Ugh, well whatever... Let's get this bad joke over with already. So, what's this thing we're after again?  
**Kiyoka:** Within this mansion, there lies a certain secret message. We need to steal it and escape the village.  
**Kofuki:** Right, great... So what the hell is "a certain secret message"? What "village"?  
**Kiyoka:** The secret message is a secret message. The village is a village. Please don't try to poke holes in the setting.  
**Kofuki:** Poke holes\!\? Between the secret message and the village, there's more holes than setting\!  
**Kofuki:** I guess it doesn't matter... I just have to play along. Let's hurry and get this over with\!  
Once again, on the other side--

  
**Maki:** There you are\! Skulking around in a place like this; you truly are rats\!  
**Nagasaki Sumi:** Ahh, we're not rats, we're ninja...  
**Maruyama Akane:** That's right\! We're ninja, so of course we're gonna hide\!  
**Akane:** A ninja without the nin is just a ja\! [ninja is made up the kanji nin, to hide, and ja, person]  
**Mai:** Still, to be discovered so quickly... We can't take the Origami ninja lightly.  
**Maki:** In the first place, you're all disorganized.  
**Maki:** What a shame... At this rate, our fun will be over all too soon.  
**Akane:** Hey-\! We Mokusa ninja've been training our bodies hard\! You'll regret looking down on us\!  
**Sumi:** Ah... We were trying to stay undercover... Why did you say who we are...?  
**Akane:** Ah- No wayyy\! You tricked me\! That's playing dirty\!  
**Suzuka:** I don't believe it; you actually revealed your own identity... Even disorganized was giving you too much credit. Please try not to disappoint us any further.  
**Mai:** We have no obligation to meet your expectations, but we can't continue like we planned. Everyone, get ready\!  
**Sumi:** Right\!  
**Akane:** I'll follow your lead\!  
**Suzuka:** ...Well, self-proclaimed Mokusa ninja, could you please entertain us for a while?  
**Maki:** You came all this way to face defeat\!  

## 2: The Difference in Daily Training Shown Through Defeat
**Akane:** Ninja Art: Deadlift Technique\!\!  
**Maki:** I can see right through it\!  
**Maki:** HNPH-\!\!  
**Akane:** Gahhh\! So... Heavy... How can one strike be that heavy\!\?  
**Maki:** Oh...? You were able to block that? Though if you don't put your hips into it, you'll be split in two.  
**Akane:** Easy for you to say, but I'm overworked here...\!  
**Akane:** For me to get overpowered like this... No way... You're so tough... What routine did you do to get like this?  
**Maki:** I'll tell you... First, a light run of about 40km. Follow that with fingertip push ups, sit ups, lat pulldowns, squat hops, lateral crossovers, and pull ups. That's 500 repetitions of each.  
**Maki:** Then 200 curls with a 40kg weight in each hand. Next, with an axe, I chop 1,000 pieces of firewood, followed by 2,000 practice swings with my sword.  
**Maki:** Now a run up a flight of 200 stone steps, 20 times. Then a 20km swim against the waves. Finally, two sparring sessions to finish it off.  
**Maki:** Take a good cleansing bath to relax your muscles, and eat a lot of nutritious food. That's all.  
**Akane:** That's all...\! Your routine's insane...\!  
**Suzuka:** If she's off duty that day, she'll do it all twice...  
**Suzuka:** Or at least, that's the character she's playing.  
**Akane:** Character\!\? I thought you were serious, you got me\~\!  
**Maki:** Don't break character, Suzuka. You ruined such a perfect mood\!  
**Suzuka:** It could cause trouble if she actually believed you. Not to mention, I didn't think you'd get so carried away...  
**Maki:** Anyway, with the rigorous training I go through every day, my strength has no equal\!  
**Maki:** And here's proof\! Origami Ninja Art: Great Tornado Whirlwind Cutter\!\!  
**Mai:** This... Sword pressure... Kyaaaaa\!\!  
**Akane:** Gyaaaah\~ I'm beaaaaat\~... Thud...\!\!  
**Sumi:** Th-Thud...\!  
**Maki:** In the end, you were no match for us Origami ninja. You need to show more dedication to your training.  
**Suzuka:** Sakurayoshi, please escort the captured Yanase Mai, Maruyama Akane, and Nagasaki Sumi to the dungeon.  
**Sakura:** U-Understood\!  
**Maki:** ...Still, it doesn't add up.  
**Suzuka:** What doesn't?  
**Maki:** Did Mokusa's leader really believe ninja of that caliber could steal the secret letter from our mansion?  
**Suzuka:** Perhaps... They lack the manpower for it?  
**Maki:** Perhaps. But it's too soon to grow complacent.  
**Maki:** Us undermining their plan could have been another part of their plan. Thinking along those lines--  
**Suzuka:** I see... These girls were a diversion. Their main force is sneaking in elsewhere.  
**Maki:** It's a reasonable assumption.  
**Suzuka:** Then, let us hunt down this main force. Maybe they can prove more entertaining.  

## 3: That's a Promise
**Kiyoka:** I see why they call this the impregnable ninja mansion of the Origami ninja. We'll have to move cautiously through here.  
**Kiyoka:** Of course there's hidden pitfalls... But then there's this kind of trap and that kind of trap. Not to mention, I didn't even think they could prepare a trap like that one\! Very impressive.  
**Kofuki:** This kind of trap and that kind of trap? What kind of trap?  
**Kiyoka:** Y-You know... An amazing trap that would make you shout "AHH\!\" if you sprung it...  
**Kofuki:** I hate to rain on your parade, but there's no traps anywhere in here, you know?  
**Kiyoka:** Well\~, what about a falling ceiling or a flooding room... It's more fun to pretend those kind of traps are there\!  
**Kofuki:** ...You're surprisingly into this stuff, huh, Kiyoka. Well, at least someone's having fun with it.  
**Kiyoka:** Are you not having fun, Kofukimaru-san?  
**Kofuki:** Do I look like I'm having fun? I keep telling you, let's just get this over with so we can go home already.  
**Kiyoka:** For that, we need to locate their secret letter...  
**Kofuki:** Yeah, I know. The problem is where are they keeping this secret whatever?  
**Kiyoka:** According to the setting, the secret letter is extremely important, so they must be keeping it in the most secure part of the mansion.  
**Kiyoka:** Looking at the structure of the building... Ah, I mean, considering the circumstances, I believe it's in the innermost room of the mansion.  
**Kofuki:** Considering the circumstances, the innermost room, huh. You sure about that?  
**Kiyoka:** In cases like this, that's a promise.  
**Kofuki:** Promise, huh... So you've really got no idea.  
**Kiyoka:** Let's head deeper in at least. The secret letter is sure to be there, I know it... Considering the circumstances.  
**Kofuki:** Considering the circumstances, huh... But before that, we've got guests.  
**Kiyoka:** Guests?  
**Aradama:** KIKIKIGIGIGIGIGIGI...  
**Kiyoka:** Aradama\!\? No way, why\!\?  
**Kofuki:** Who cares why? They showed up at the best possible time\!  
**Kofuki:** I was about to die from boredom\! I love you\! My aradama-chan\!  
**Kofuki:** Mmmm\~ I feel great\! Aradama-chan's the best after all\!  
**Kiyoka:** Using aradama is going too far\! I never heard anything about this.  
**Kiyoka:** Do the defenders want to win that badly? In that case, this should count as a foul... Actually, it should be an out.  
**Kiyoka:** Since it's come to this, we can't afford to lose either. We have to defeat the evil deputies, and bring peace back to the land\!  
**Kofuki:** No, there's no evil deputies\! And the game's rules didn't say anything about peace; we've just gotta bring back the secret letter.  
**Kiyoka:** .........\! Ah, that's right\!  
**Kofuki:** Don't give me that. Just how carried away with this game are you gonna get? And anyway, about those aradama.  
**Kofuki:** They didn't come from the other team. They must have just showed up on their own.  
**Kiyoka:** They did\!\?  
**Kofuki:** No matter how bad they want to win, nobody's gonna use aradama for this dumbass make believe exercise\!  
**Kofuki:** .........They wouldn't, right?  

## 4: After a Furious Finish, Farewell, Ninja Mansion
**Kiyoka:** ...Kofukimaru-san. It seems we've reached the mansion's innermost room. That secret letter is sure to be here...  
**Kofuki:** It was surprisingly easy finding this place.  
**Suzuka:** Fufufufufu... Of course it was.  
**Suzuka:** After all, we wanted to guide you here.  
**Kiyoka:** The Origami ninja, they found us\!\?  
**Maki:** Suspecting nothing, you happily wandered right into our ambush.  
**Maki:** There's nowhere left to run or hide. At last you realize, you're nothing but trapped rats.  
**Kofuki:** Trapped rats, or wolves in sheep's clothing? Doesn't matter. Either way, we're gonna lay you flat here.  
**Maki:** Oh? At least your tongue is sharp, if nothing else.  
**Kofuki:** You'll find out how sharp the rest is, once we beat you.  
**Maki:** You're not too bad at this.  
**Kiyoka:** More importantly... Where's the secret letter?  
**Suzuka:** If that's what you're after, Sakurayoshi is guarding it there.  
**Kiyoka:** That's...  
**Maki:** I'll handle our foes. Sakurayoshi, in the meantime, keep the secret letter safe\!  
**Sakura:** U-U-U-U-Understood\! Ahh- Kyaah\!\!  
**Suzuka:** What are you doing, Sakurayoshi\! Hurry and escape with the secret letter\!  
**Sakura:** Ah, owwwww... I fell over, I think I cracked my butt...  
**Maki:** It was cracked from the beginning\! Hurry\! Escape\! Protect the secret letter\!  
**Sakura:** I'm sorry... B-But it hurts... Ughh, I can't stand up...  
**Maki:** Absolutely pathetic... You call yourself an Origami ninja\!\?  
**Sakura:** Ah... I'm sorry...  
**Suzuka:** Makizou-dono, don't be so hard on her. Not everyone who gathered here is a toji like us. She's only a researcher from the medical department.  
**Maki:** ...Have you forgotten, Suzusuke? Right now, we're all ninja\! Nothing more, nothing less.  
**Maki:** "Toji", "researchers", words like those which break this world have no place here\!  
**Suzuka:** I understand that, but... I didn't think you'd be so obsessive about it. In a way, I'm impressed\!  
**Kiyoka:** You let your guard down\! I'll be taking the secret letter now\!  
**Maki:** Damn\! Run, Sakurayoshi\!\!  
**Sakura:** Ahhh\~\~\!\! My butt\! My butt still hurts...\!  
**Announcer:** Time is up. Time is up. The invading team could not complete their objective within the time limit. Therefore, the defending team wins.  
**Announcer:** I repeat: Time is up. Time is up. The invading team could not complete their objective within the time limit. Therefore, the defending team wins.  
**Announcer:** Good work out there, everyone. With this, the special training course "Ninja Mansion" is concluded.  
**Maki:** Phew\~ We were in a pinch, but it's our victory.  
**Suzuka:** That was a close one, to be sure.  
**Kiyoka:** Ahhh\~, we lost...  
**Kofuki:** I couldn't care less about this training, but losing's still frustrating.  
**Kiyoka:** You say that, but I think you were enjoying it by the end, Shichinosato-san.  
**Kofuki:** Tch, I wasn't really enjoying it.  
**Sakura:** W-Well I enjoyed it\! Usually I'm too busy with research to get out much, so... I had fun\!  
**Maki:** Don't be mistaken, this wasn't a game. It's still practice. A part of our training.  
**Suzuka:** There's nothing wrong with enjoying your training though, isn't that right, "Makizou-dono"?  
**Kofuki:** Aghh\~ If only we'd had a few more seconds\!  
**Sumi:** I'm jealous you all got to participate till the end...  
**Akane:** I know, they just scooped us up and locked us away\! I thought we'd get to do more\!  
**Mai:** Let's learn from our mistakes next time.  
**Maki:** We aren't about to lose next time either.  
**Kofuki:** Next time...? You can't be serious. If you're gonna do it, have fun without me.  
**Maki:** What are you saying, Shichinosato Kofuki? You don't mean you're quitting here, do you?  
**Kofuki:** Huhh? You're the one talking crazy. Of course I'm not sticking around\!  
**Suzuka:** Oh my. It seems that no one explained in detail to you.  
**Kofuki:** About what?  
**Maki:** The foundation of this project is role-playing. Along with the victory condition, it's important that you're able to adapt to your role.  
**Maki:** This program serves as training for your ability to carry out whatever role you're given.  
**Maki:** It goes without saying that a team of toji working together need to trust each other to cooperate. Acting according to your private interests is forbidden.  
**Suzuka:** And in your case, Shichinosato-san. With your complete lack of cooperation, we were asked by Kitora Mirja-san to train you thoroughly.  
**Maki:** Don't think you'll get to leave until after we finish all seven more sets.  
**Kofuki:** Huuuhhhh\~\~\~\~\~\~\!\? Seven sets\!\?  
**Announcer:** In a moment, the next training course will begin. The name of the program is "The Queen and the Great Thieves". Details of the mission are as follows--  
**Kofuki:** LET ME OUT OF HERE ALREADYYY\!\!
