## 1: Into a Sea of Trees
**Mihono:** Haaaah-\!  
**Kiyoka:** Pant, phew... A-Are there still more aradama...?  
**Mirja:** There was an investigation into the aradama that appeared in this region, but these numbers are greater than anything they predicted...\!  
**Kofuki:** You say that like it's a bad thing\! I couldn't be happier about it, all these aradama-chan to slice up\!  
**Kofuki:** Check it out\! They just keep coming\!  
**Mirja:** Shichinosato Kofuki, don't push ahead\! If you break formation, their attacks will become concentrated on Musumi Kiyoka\!  
**Kiyoka:** Eh\!\? Kyaaa\!  
**Mirja:** (Not good, Musumi Kiyoka's utsushi was broken...\! If she's attacked any further...\!)  
**Chie:** Kiyoka-chan\! Are you hurt\!\?  
**Kiyoka:** Th-Thank you\~... I'm not hurt, but I don't think I can use utsushi anymore...  
**Mirja:** (...I can't continue to overlook Shichinosato Kofuki's reckless behavior in combat...)  
**Mihono:** W-We finally beat 'em all...\! Ahh\~...  
**Mirja:** Shichinosato Kofuki. We need to talk.  
**Kofuki:** Huh? About what?  
**Mirja:** During the fighting, because of the way you disrupted our formation, you put Musumi Kiyoka in serious danger.  
**Mirja:** To prevent this from happening again, please refrain from making such meaningless charges and follow my orders to the letter. To begin with, if we stay in formation, we minimize the risk of casualties while defeating aradama...  
**Kofuki:** Ha, as if\! If I see even a single aradama, I'm going after it.  
**Kofuki:** If I followed your lameass orders, that's just less chances I get to spend beating on my darling aradama-chan.  
**Mirja:** If you're looking for more opportunities to defeat aradama, following my orders will actually make that happen. The result would mean more aradama you get to fight.  
**Kofuki:** I'm gonna do things my own way. So just give it a rest already.  
**Mihono:** Th-The mood's really taking a turn for the worse...  
**Chie:** Settle down, you two. Getting in a fight here isn't going to accomplish anything.  
**Chie:** Sigh... All this fighting against aradama might have worn us down and put us on edge. We should take a break every now and then; why not have a peaceful stroll through the woods here--  
**Mihono:** Eh...\!\?  
**Mihono:** Wh... What happened\!\? Where, where are we\!\? Is this thing... A plant?  
**Chie:** It seems like these giant roots and vines wrap all across the ground...? I've never seen anything like it.  
**Chie:** I've heard of a sea of trees, but I don't think it's supposed to look like this...  
**Kiyoka:** --\!\! A-Aradama\!  
**Kofuki:** There's still some left, hahaha\! Who cares where this is, so long as there's aradama to hunt\!  
**Mirja:** Stop, first we should confirm our situation--  
**Kofuki:** If we sit around trying to figure that out now, we'll be the ones getting killed\!  
**Kanami:** Hey, Mai-chan\!\? Where is this\!\?  
**Mai:** I don't know... I think even in the densest of jungles you wouldn't find plants like this growing...  
**Sayaka:** Before we think about anything, we should defeat the aradama.  
**???:** Hero PUUUUUUNCH\!\!  
**???:** Onee-chan, what are these black things\~\!\? A new kind of Vertex\!\?  
**???:** I've never heard of anything like them... They don't look like Stardust or Vertex...?  
**???:** Mmm\~... These are something different from Vertex.  
**???:** It doesn't seem like they're affecting Mankai either. It's abnormal.  
**???:** Everyone, look at your phones\! ...Besides Heroes and Vertex, there's two different kinds of markers on the map.  

## 2: A Chance Meeting
**Kofuki:** C'mon, bring it on, my sweet aradama-chans\!  
**Mirja:** Shichinosato Kofuki, fall back\! It's dangerous committing to a battle before we come to an understanding of our situation\!  
**Mirja:** Fortunately, there's no sign of people here\! If we retreat, no one should be hurt\!  
**Kofuki:** Retreat? Hell no. Do you even remember what you said before? How following your orders was gonna let me bag more aradama\! You think running away'll make that happen?  
**Kofuki:** I got it, how about this. Your way vs my way, we'll have a little competition to see who can kill the most aradama.  
**Mirja:** Competition? Do you realize what kind of situation we're in\!\?  
**Kofuki:** I'll beat aradama how I want. And you can do your own thing. If you actually get more aradama than me, I'll do whatever you say\!  
**Mirja:** Wait\! Stay in formation\!  
**Mihono:** Pant, pant... Th-This is looking pretty tough... I'm losing focus after fighting back to back...  
**Kiyoka:** I can't maintain utsushi either...  
**Chie:** Mihono-chan, Kiyoka-chan get behind me\! I'll keep you two safe\!  
**Mirja:** (With Shichinosato Kofuki leaving formation, Asakura Mihono and Musumi Kiyoka need to leave their position so Setouchi Chie can protect them...)  
**Mirja:** (Our coordination is in shambles... If only I could keep them in order...)  
**Chie:** No matter how many we defeat, there's still more\! There's no end to them...\!  
**Kiyoka:** Another bunch of aradama are headed this way\!  
**Mihono:** When did we get surrounded\!\?  
**Chie:** Ugh...\!  
**Mihono:** Chii-nee\!\!  
**Chie:** I'm fine... Your onee-chan will take care of you.  
**Mirja:** (There's a limit to what Setouchi Chie and I can accomplish. At this rate, we'll be overrun...\!)  
**Mirja:** ...\!\? Was that a gunshot...?  
**???:** Allied forces sighted\! Providing backup\!  
**???:** I'll hold it down, so the rest is up to you, onee-chan\!  
**Mirja:** (The aradama is wrapped in wires... Stopping its movement\!\?)  
**???:** Leave it to me-\! I'll show you my girl power\! Teryaaaa\!  
**???:** I chopped its legs off at least\! Even these black things shouldn't be able to move after that\!  
**???:** Onee-chan, your girl power is just physics, isn't it...  
**???:** You over there, this is your chance\! Attack now\!  
**Mirja:** ...\! Setouchi Chie, while it can no longer move, cut it down.  
**Chie:** Right, I'm on it\!  
**Mihono:** S-Somehow, we beat them all...?  
**???:** Phew\~... Looks like it.  
**Mirja:** ...Thank you for your support. However... Who are you?  
**Mirja:** How are you able to fight against aradama without wielding okatana?  
**???:** We've got some questions to ask too. How is it that even though you aren't Heroes, you can move around in the Jukai?  

## 3: Toji and Heroes and Aradama and
**Kanami:** That's-- The tenth one\!\!  
**Sayaka:** There's too many aradama. We're at a disadvantage.  
**Mai:** With the ground covered in vegetation, it's hard to get good footing... And we can't run with aradama coming from all directions.  
**???:** You there-\! We're here to help\~\~\!  
**Kanami:** Eh?  
**???:** Hero\! PUUUUUUNCH\!\!  
**Kanami:** Sh-She punched... An aradama\!\? Wh... What's she thinking?  
**Sayaka:** But that punch, it affected the aradama...  
**???:** Yuuna, don't turn your back on your opponent after just one hit\! Watch and learn the way a full fledged Hero fights\! Haah-\! Teyaa-\!\!  
**Mai:** That girl over there, is she using okatana...? Is she a toji?  
**Kanami:** Ah, watch out\! There's another aradama behind you\!  
**???:** --\!\?  
**???:** You too, Nibosshi\~. You can't be so careless\~.  
**???:** I... I was showing them my back on purpose, to lure them in. But, uh, thanks, Sonoko.  
**???:** You're very welcome\~. I'm glad you're safe, Nibosshi.  
**Mai:** Her weapon is... A spear. Why is she fighting aradama without an okatana...?  
**Kanami:** Incredible\! They aren't even using kongoushi or jin'i, but they're jumping all over the place\!  
**???:** Um, everyone\! We'll help you out, so let's finish them off\!  
**Kanami:** Okay\! Thanks\!  
**Mai:** Phew... I think we managed to take care of all the aradama.  
**Kanami:** Hey, you\! How do you jump around all crazy like that? Is that outfit some kind of new Storm Armor or something\!\?  
**Kanami:** Are you a toji who uses martial arts, like in Taisha-Ryu\!\? Ah, but you don't have an okatana, do you...  
**???:** Storm Armor...? Toji?  
**Kanami:** Ah, what's the names of those okatana you have\!\? What school of fighting did you learn? From what I saw before, it looked like you were using some changquan from Chinese martial arts to close the distance for your swordfighting, right\!  
**???:** Uh, as for my school, I...  
**Kanami:** Is your spear some kind of okatana too\!\? The tip is a weird shape, isn't it\! It looks like you fight differently than with a normal spear, don't you...\!  
**???:** Wow\~, you're awfully friendly\~.  
**Mai:** Kanami-chan, stop\! You're overwhelming them.  
**Kanami:** Ah, I'm so sorry\! I just...  
**Mai:** But, I have a question too. Just who are you people?  
**Yuuna:** Um... I'm Yuuki Yuuna\! I'm a 2nd year in Sanshu Middle School, and a "Hero"\!  
**Karin:** I'm Mitsuboshi Karin. And a Hero too.  
**Sonoko:** Nogi Sonoko, and a Hero like them too\~.  
**Karin:** Anyway, what's the deal with you? The only things that are supposed to be able to move around in the Jukai are Vertex and Heroes. So are you Heroes too?  
**Kanami:** Heroes... I don't really get it, but we're "Toji"\! I'm Etou Kanami, a 2nd year in middle school at Minoseki Academy\!  
**Mai:** I'm a toji as well... My name is Yanase Mai, and another 2nd year from middle school at Minoseki Academy.  
**Sayaka:** Itomi Sayaka, a 1st year in middle school at Renpu Girls' School.  
**Karin:** So uhh... You aren't Heroes...?  
**Sonoko:** Nibosshi. These girls aren't Heroes\~. But, they have another kind of special power like Heroes do.  
**Sonoko:** In the middle of battle earlier, there were a few times they moved incredibly fast, or showed strength well beyond what a person's capable of. That's different from a Hero, don't you think?  
**Kanami:** Ah, you mean jin'i and hachimanriki?  
**Karin:** Jin'i, hachimanriki... Never heard of it.  
**Sonoko:** Maybe... Do you happen to know about those strange black monsters too?  
**Mai:** The aradama?  
**Sonoko:** So you do know. Then, an unknown power and unknown enemies... It's as if... Eureka\! I've got an idea\!  
**Yuuna:** What's up? Did you figure something out, Sono-chan?  
**Sonoko:** I think this is... The union of two parallel worlds\~\!  
**Kanami/Yuuna:** Parallel worlds\!\?  
**Sonoko:** Let's see, making things clearer for the toji people\~... First off, this is a special place called the Jukai\~.  
**Sonoko:** In the Jukai is where we Heroes fight the Vertex, but I think you toji and those aradama were pulled in from a parallel world.  
**Karin:** I'm not really sure I believe that, but... At times like these your first instincts are usually pretty on point...  
**Mai:** But... Parallel worlds...?  
**Sonoko:** In our world, at the center of the Jukai, is Shinju-sama, where all the gods reside.  
**Sonoko:** There are many legends of Shinju-sama drawing in gods of other worlds.  
**Kanami:** Gods of other worlds...? Ah, now that you mention it, aradama were originally thought to be some sort of divine existence...  
**Sonoko:** I see\~... Then, Shinju-sama might have drawn in aradama as gods of another world.  
**Mai:** Why would it do that...?  
**Sonoko:** Hmmm\~... There's a bit of a situation in our world, where right now Shinju-sama's power is gradually weakening.  
**Sonoko:** That's why Shinju-sama must have called these aradama in, to absorb their latent divinity and replenish some of its power.  
**Sonoko:** But the impurity of these aradama must have been too strong for it to take in their divinity, so you toji people might have been summoned to help defeat and purify them\~.  
**Yuuna:** Hmm... Sounds complicated. I don't really get it, but I do know it must be a big deal of people from another world are showing up\!  
**Karin:** Well, isn't that enough, Yuuna? That's usually about all it takes for you.  
**Yuuna:** Karin-chan, it sounds like you're making fun of me.  
**Karin:** But you don't really understand the situation, do you?  
**Yuuna:** Ummm\~...... Nope\!  
**Kanami:** Ahaha. You're pretty funny, Yuuna-chan. I think we'll get along.  
**Mai:** Ah, right... I agree.  

## 4: Etou Kanami and Yuuki Yuuna
**Kanami:** Do you think we're the only toji who came to this world?  
**Karin:** No, I'm pretty sure a lot more like you ended up here too.  
**Kanami:** Really?  
**Karin:** The map on our phones normally shows the location of vertex and Heroes, but it seems like it's showing aradama and toji now too. And it's picking up lots more toji.  
**Yuuna:** When we looked at the map, there were a bunch of people fighting aradama, so we went to help at the places with the most enemies.  
**Yuuna:** There's another place with a lot of aradama, but the other Heroes went to help there too.  
**Karin:** Ah, our leader's calling. Hello, Fuu?  
**Karin:** You took care of things over there? Got it. We're done here too, so let's meet up.  
**Mai:** You can make phone calls in here...?  
**Sonoko:** Shinju-sama's power makes it possible\~.  
**Sayaka:** Shinju-sama... Is surprisingly thoughtful?  
**Karin:** Well, anyway, we're meeting up with our allies. There's toji over with them too.  
**Yuuna:** When we transform into Heroes, we get this awesome power\! We can jump like whoosh, and beat big monsters with a punch, like wham\!  
**Kanami:** I couldn't believe it when I saw you punch that aradama. What style of martial arts is that?  
**Yuuna:** Uhhh\~, it's the Hero Punch\!  
**Kanami:** There's a hero style martial arts\!\?  
**Yuuna:** Umm, my dad taught me self defense, but I don't really know about actual fighting styles.  
**Mai:** I wonder how we're meant to get back to our world. We can't stay here for too long...  
**Sonoko:** Since Shinju-sama's goal is retrieving the divinity from aradama, once it's satisfied, I'm sure it will return you and the aradama back to your own world\~.  
**Sayaka:** We just have to beat lots of aradama...? Okay, it's good that it's simple.  
**Sonoko:** Ah, and by the way, it's up to you toji people to defeat the aradama\~. I think we'll have to focus on supporting you.  
**Sayaka:** ...? Why? You should be strong enough to fight aradama.  
**Karin:** You're right about that, but even though we can fight them, it doesn't seem like we can do enough damage to finish them off.  
**Sonoko:** A Hero's power is for defeating Vertex. A toji's power is for defeating aradama.  
**Sonoko:** That's why a Hero can't defeat an aradama, and a toji can't defeat a Vertex... That's how it works.  
**Karin:** I guess, so if any Vertex show up, we'll be the ones to defeat them.  
**Kanami:** Well, that's fine. Suppressing aradama has always been a toji's job, after all\! Just getting support from you guys will be more than enough help\!  
**Mai:** That's right, it's thanks to your support earlier that we were able to make it through.  
**Yuuna:** Yeah, we'll do our best to help you out. And after we beat a lot of aradama, you and Kanami-chan can go back home\!  
**Yuuna:** It's one of the Hero Club's five tenets\! You're likely to succeed if you try\!  
**Kanami:** Ah, that sounds kind of like what Mihono-chan's always saying.  
**Yuuna:** Who's Mihono-chan?  
**Kanami:** A friend of mine. Mihono-chan always says, "Where there's a will, there's a way."  
**Kanami:** Hmm, come to think of it, you remind me of Mihono-chan, Yuuna-chan. Like how you're both full of energy, and how it's fun being around you\!  

## 5: Mirja and Mai's Respective Worries
**???:** This is the Jukai... Ordinarily, only Heroes should be able to move around in here.  
**Mirja:** Jukai? Heroes? What are you talking about?  
**Mihono:** Umm\~... Mirja-san, she helped us out, so I don't think they're enemies...?  
**Mirja:** To fight evenly against an aradama without an okatana is beyond reasoning. We can't exclude the possibility that they themselves are aradama.  
**Kanami:** Hang on a minute\~\~\!  
**Mihono:** Ah, Kanami\!  
**Kanami:** These girls aren't our enemies\! They're going to fight the aradama together with us\!  
**Yuuna:** Fuu-senpai, Tougou-san, Itsuki-chan, they're our allies.  
**Mirja:** ...This is meant to be a parallel world...? ...It's difficult to take something like that at face value.  
**Chie:** But Mirja, it's true we're in an inexplicable place. And to begin with, a part of our powers as toji come from the other world that is the netherworld.  
**Chie:** Besides that, I agree with Mihono-chan. I can't see these girls as a danger to us.  
**Mihono:** Thanks, Chii-nee.  
**???:** And if Yuuna-chan says so, we'll believe her.  
**Yuuna:** Thanks, Tougou-san\!  
**Kofuki:** Whatever, I don't really care if they're with us or against us.  
**Kofuki:** Let me make this clear though, don't go stealing any of my prey. I've got dibs on all my darling aradama-chan.  
**???:** You won't have to worry about that. It doesn't seem like we can destroy aradama, so we'll only be supporting you.  
**Fuu:** Right, since we've come to a sort of agreement, we should introduce ourselves. I'm Inubouzaki Fuu, a 3rd year at Sanshu Middle School, and a Hero.  
**Tougou:** Likewise, I'm a Hero and 2nd year at Sanshu Middle School, Tougou Mimori.  
**Itsuki:** Uhh... I'm a first year at Sanshu Middle School, Inubouzaki Itsuki.  
**Mihono:** I'm a second year middle schooler at Minoseki Academy--  
**Mirja:** (I'm not entirely convinced we can trust them yet... But from what Etou Kanami-san had to say, we may be able to join forces for the time being.)  
**Mirja:** (If that's the case, there's no need to maintain this level of needless hostility...)  
**Kanami:** --\!\? Another bunch of aradama are here\!  
**Karin:** Doesn't seem like we have much free time to spend getting to know each other\! Let's get rid of them first\!  
**Kofuki:** This place might actually be heaven, to keep running into hordes of aradama-chan like this\! Hahaha\!  
**Mirja:** Shichinosato Kofuki\! She's going off on her own again--  
**Kofuki:** I love you, aradama-chan\! I'll kick all your asses\!  
**Mirja:** Sigh...  
**Chie:** It's no use, that's just Kofuki-chan's fighting style. Mihono-chan, Kiyoka-chan, stay back.  
**Chie:** You still can't use utsushi, can you, Kiyoka-chan? And your concentration must have run out after all these battles, Mihono-chan.  
**Mihono:** Chii-nee... Yeah, I'm sorry.  
**Kiyoka:** Thank you. If it's okay with you, I'll stay back...  
**Kanami:** We'll cover for you\!  
**Sayaka:** There's lots of people here.  
**Yuuna:** And we'll be supporting\!  
**Kofuki:** Keep it coming, you lovely aradama-chans\! I'll wipe out every one of you\!  
**Fuu:** Man, that Kofuki girl reminds me a lot of the old Karin. Like how you wanted to do all the fighting yourself. I remember you always bragging about you'd beat every Vertex alone.  
**Karin:** Well I don't remember saying any of that-\!  
**Fuu:** Oh\~, really? Hmmm\~? Hyaah-\!  
**Itsuki:** I'll keep that aradama trapped with wire\! There\~\!  
**Tougou:** Thank you, Itsuki-chan\! For the sake of the nation, I'll shoot it down\!  
**Mirja:** (Heroes... These girls don't seem to pay much thought to formations or tactics. I'd assume they're relative amateurs to group combat...)  
**Mirja:** (However, why is it they act with such a high level of unity...? In fact... They're more coordinated than we are...)  
**Yuuna:** Hero, PUUUUUUNCH\!  
**Yuuna:** Kanami-chan\! This aradama's headed your way\! I softened it up for you-\!  
**Kanami:** Thanks, Yuuna-chan\! I got it\! Haah-\!  
**Sayaka:** Those two... They're working well together.  
**Mai:** Yes... You're right.  
**Sayaka:** Mai...? Is something wrong?  
**Mai:** Oh no, it's nothing\! Come on, we have to help fight too\!  

## 6: The Way Each Handles Things
**Chie:** There-- That's the last of them\!  
**Itsuki:** Phew\~... We defeated all the aradama, right?  
**Chie:** Thank you, Itsuki-chan. The way you tied down the aradama made attacking them a piece of cake.  
**Itsuki:** It was nothing; I'm just glad I could help.  
**Mirja:** Inubouzaki Fuu-san. Your Heroes form a good team... Despite showing such individualistic abilities, you were all able to combine your strengths. What sort of commands did you give?  
**Fuu:** Huh, commands? No way, you're expecting way too much from me...  
**Fuu:** Ah... By the way, sorry. You're older than me, but I haven't even been using honorifics with you, Kitora-san.  
**Mirja:** No, that doesn't bother me. In the situation we've found ourselves in, it's hardly a concern.  
**Fuu:** I'm glad to hear you say that. You don't have to be so formal with me either, Kitora-san.  
**Mirja:** No, this is only a usual speaking habit of mine. When relaying orders in the middle of battle, speaking concisely and clearly is the most important factor.  
**Fuu:** Ah, then the mood you have in battle is pretty different from mine. ...You're sort of unusual, Kitora-san.  
**Mirja:** Do you think so?  
**Fuu:** Yeah. But, when we were fighting, you were pretty cool too.  
**Fuu:** Oh, about what you were saying before about giving commands in battle... I don't really tell them to do anything.  
**Fuu:** I just let everyone decide what they think is the best thing to do. And I try to keep an eye on everyone to make sure none of them get hurt.  
**Fuu:** That's why, watching how intense you get giving everyone orders, I think that's pretty amazing compared to me.  
**Mirja:** (Letting everyone act on their own, without giving any particular orders...? That line of thinking won't--)  
**Mirja:** (No... The fact of the matter is, that's how she's led the Hero unit...)  
**Yuuna:** Kanami-chan, you're so good with a sword\! You were really slicing and dicing those aradama up\!  
**Kanami:** It's all because I had you helping me out, Yuuna-chan\!  
**Mai:** ...  
**Tougou:** What's the matter, Yanase-san? All the aradama have been defeated, yet you look disappointed...?  
**Mai:** Ah... You're right. I was surprised at just how well Yuuki-san and Kanami-chan were getting along while they were fighting, and I ended up feeling jealous.  
**Tougou:** Jealous?  
**Mai:** Yes. Yuuki-san is so bright and cheery. ...Mihono-chan, Yuuki-san, and Kanami-chan all resemble each other like that.  
**Mai:** I'm always around Kanami-chan, but I feel as if she'd rather be with Mihono-chan--  
**Tougou:** Don't worry, Yanase-san.  
**Tougou:** Hey, Yuuna-chan\! Do you have a moment?  
**Yuuna:** What's up? Tougou-san.  
**Tougou:** Yuuna-chan and I don't seem much alike, do we?  
**Yuuna:** Huh? What are you saying, all of a sudden. Hmm, you're right though, Tougou-san and I are totally different.  
**Yuuna:** I'm not smart like Tougou-san is, and I don't know how to use computers, and I can't shoot like she can from so far away.  
**Tougou:** I'm no good at sports like Yuuna-chan is, and I can't get along with anyone as quickly as she can. Of course I don't fight with my fists either.  
**Tougou:** But Yuuna-chan and I are the closest, aren't we?  
**Yuuna:** Mm, you're my best friend, Tougou-san\!  
**Tougou:** Fufu, I'm glad to hear it.  
**Tougou:** See, Yanase-san. Even if we aren't alike, I think it's wonderful the way we complement each other.  
**Mai:** Tougou-san... Yuuna-san...  
**Sayaka:** Tougou and Yuuna are right. There are good things about you, Mai.  
**Sayaka:** You might not be like Kanami and Mihono, but... I know all the good things about you.  
**Mai:** Sayaka-chan...  
**Mai:** Mm... Thank you.  

## 7: Fighting like Yourself
**Chie:** So, what do you think we should be doing now, Mirja? If defeating lots of aradama will return us to our world, should we continue fighting aradama like this--  
**Chie:** Or, since it seems like other toji arrived in the Jukai, should we make our way to them?  
**Mirja:** Let's see, the safest option would have to be the latter...  
**Mihono:** Ah\! Look, Chii-nee\! The spectrum finder's picking something up\!  
**Chie:** --\! Such a big reaction... There's a strong aradama headed right towards us.  
**Kofuki:** Oh, that one? That bigass aradama's bringing a whole mess of small fry with it. Looks like that big one's on the hunt too\!  
**Sonoko:** Shinju-sama might have wanted to speed up the gathering of divinity, so it started drawing in bigger targets to the Jukai\~.  
**Mirja:** It seems we longer have the luxury of meeting with other toji. We'll intercept them here.  
**Kofuki:** Ha, course we will\! I'll tear that cute giant aradama-chan apart. I love it when they've got some meat to them\!\!  
**Chie:** Kofuki-chan\! Don't run off on your own--  
**Mirja:** No, let her go. She's fine as she is.  
**Chie:** Are you sure?  
**Mirja:** This way allows her to fully exercise her abilities. We can create a formation following Shichinosato Kofuki's lead. Etou Kanami, Yanase Mai, get in position diagonally behind Shichinosato Kofuki's right flank\!  
**Kanami:** Okay\!  
**Mai:** Understood\!  
**Mirja:** Setouchi Chie, Itomi Sayaka, hold position diagonally behind Shichinosato Kofuki's left flank\!  
**Chie:** Roger.  
**Sayaka:** I'll do it.  
**Mirja:** I will take my place fighting behind Shichinosato Kofuki. Asakura Mihono, Musumi Kiyoka, find a safe place and wait. If you feel you've recovered, return to the battle.  
**Mihono:** Got it\!  
**Kiyoka:** Okay.  
**Mirja:** Also, I'll leave command of the Hero unit to Inubouzaku Fuu\!  
**Fuu:** Sure, you can count on us.  
**Mirja:** Now, let's move\!  
**Mirja:** (Compared to the Heroes who began as friends, we of the investigation team and toji are organized too differently. Therefore, we cannot operate the same as them.)  
**Mirja:** (However, if we begin our coordination from trusting in our members, creating a formation around that, we can fight like them.)  
**Mirja:** (Rather than deciding everything myself, by having faith in them, a loose framework can be formed that better allows them to naturally express their abilities.)  
**Mirja:** (Yes... This is how I should have been fighting, as the commander of this investigation team...\!)  
**Kanami:** Haah\!  
**Kanami:** Uwah\!  
**Kanami:** (Not good, while I was focused on one, another aradama got a hit in...)  
**Mai:** Kanami-chan\! I'm right here\!  
**Kanami:** Thanks, Mai-chan. You saved me\!  
**Kanami:** I feel a lot safer fighting with you around. You're always on the lookout, and when I mess up I know I can fall back on you, Mai-chan.  
**Mai:** Fufu, I'm here for you. So you just focus on fighting, Kanami-chan.  
**Kanami:** Yeah\! C'mon, let's finish them off\!  
**Kofuki:** Orrraaaa-\!  
**Kofuki:** Pante, pant, pant... Tch, there's a few too many of them after all. I'm getting surrounded here...  
**Mirja:** Don't stop, Shichinosato Kofuki\! Continue pushing through, and eliminate the aradama at their center\!  
**Mirja:** We will destroy the remaining aradama\! Force your way forward, the way you always do\!  
**Kofuki:** Mirja...? You sure about that? Then I wouldn't be doing things your way.  
**Mirja:** I don't mind. Creating situations for my teammates to easily display their strengths is a part of my duty as commander.  
**Kofuki:** Huh... Then, don't go changing your mind on me\!  
**Kofuki:** Here I come, boss aradama-chan\! I'll carve all my love into you\!   

## 8: A Pleasant Dream
**Mirja:** Shichinosato Kofuki\! Finish it off\!  
**Kofuki:** You don't have to tell me\! Uraaah\!  
**Chie:** She did it\! The largest aradama went down.  
**Sayaka:** The other aradama are taken care of. All that were left were small ones.  
**Kofuki:** ...Thanks, Mirja.  
**Mirja:** ...? What's this about?  
**Kofuki:** Just, nevermind...  
**Kofuki:** Anyway, looks like I'm the winner of our contest to kill the most aradama, huh? I got the boss and a whole bunch more, you know.  
**Mirja:** Honestly, when it comes to you...  
**Mirja:** Incidentally, you only charged in at the end after receiving my approval. Therefore, any aradama you defeated should be credited to me.  
**Kofuki:** H-Hey, it doesn't work like that\!  
**Kanami:** Huh? The Jukai, it's...  
**Sonoko:** Ah, it seems like you've defeated enough aradama, so Shinju-sama is satisfied enough to let you toji people return home\~.  
**Kanami:** Eh\!\? Just like that\!\? I wanted to hang around with Yuuna-chan and Tougou-san longer at least\!  
**Kanami:** And I wanted to have a practice fight with Karin-chan and Fuu-san, and I wanted to get to know Sonoko-chan and Itsuki-chan a little better...  
**Sonoko:** I'm sad to hear it too... But the gods don't give preference to people's circumstances.  
**Yuuna:** Still, I'm glad. This means Kanami-chan and the rest get to go back to their home world now.  
**Kanami:** Yuuna-chan\! Tougou-san\! Fuu-san\! Karin-chan\! Sonoko-chan\! Itsuki-chan\!  
**Kanami:** I hope someday, we can meet--  
**Kanami:** Nn, nnng... It's morning...?  
**Kanami:** I think I had a really weird dream...  
**Mai:** Kanami-chan, it's time to get up-\!  
**Sayaka:** Kanami... It's her day off, so she wants to sleep in.  
**Kanami:** Huh, Sayaka-chan? Why're you at Minoseki?  
**Sayaka:** I had something to do, so I came here.  
**Kanami:** Yawn... Okay, I'm getting up\~. I feel like I had a weird dream last night. But I can't remember it.  
**Mai:** Huh, you too, Kanami-chan? I don't remember what it was like, but I feel like I had a sort of pleasant dream.  
**Sayaka:** Eh...? Kanami and Mai too?  
**Kofuki:** Haaaah-\! I'll take you out one after another, aradama-chan\!  
**Chie:** Kofuki-chan, you're moving too far ahead...  
**Mirja:** It won't be a problem if she charges forward like usual. I've taken that into account and formed my tactics around it.  
**Chie:** Oh? You were angry at her when she charged in before, though.  
**Mirja:** Yes, but after the battle the other day, I determined giving her some freedom in her actions would let her be more effective.  
**Mirja:** (...The battle the other day? Which battle was that...?)  
**Chie:** Is something wrong? You look like something's bothering you.  
**Mirja:** ......No, it's nothing to worry about.  
**Mirja:** (I can't clearly remember... But it was a good experience... That at least, I'm sure of.)
