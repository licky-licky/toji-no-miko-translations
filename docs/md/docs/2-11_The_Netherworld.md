## 1: At the Mouth of the Netherworld
**Ichikishima:** ......  
**Hana:** So that's Ichikishimahime, which split off from Tagitsuhime... I can't believe they're keeping something like that shut up in a submarine...  
**Mihono:** She looks so much like a person...  
**Yui:** And pretty good looking too.  
**Kofuki:** It'd be bad if I stabbed her, right?  
**Hana:** Did you have to ask?  
**Mirja:** ...This is it.  
**Mihono:** Yeah.  
**Mihono:** (The nine of us toji here, going into the netherworld--)  
**Mihono:** (Kanami and the rest have to stay at Renpu, doing their jobs as toji and taking care of the aradama. We have to figure things out here by ourselves...)  
**Kiyoka:** To tell the truth, I'm feeling very nervous...  
**Mirja:** In that case, you could remain here if you like.  
**Kiyoka:** No, I know if I were waiting here for all of you to get back, I'd be feeling even more nervous the whole time...  
**Kiyoka:** So... I want to help, so we can all come back together\!  
**Yui:** Well, even if we don't make it back, it could be pretty fun living in the netherworld\!  
**Mihono:** Sometimes, Yui, you're so positive it's scary...  
**Maki:** All of you from the investigation team, I want to thank you again. And you, Setouchi Chie, for agreeing to help us, I really appreciate this.  
**Suzuka:** I'm deeply grateful as well. I promise you, we will return this favor by defeating Tagitsuhime.  
**Chie:** ......  
**Akane:** If everyone's prepared, we'll open the gate to the netherworld. Are you all ready?  
**Mihono:** Yes. Let's go\! Everyone\!  
**Mihono:** This is... The netherworld.  

## 2: Maki and Suzuka (1)
**Suzuka:** ...So we're in the netherworld now?  
**Maki:** From the feel of this place... It has to be. So far, so good, I think.  
**Suzuka:** Although, I don't see anyone else around. It's only us here.  
**Maki:** We must have been separated from the other toji... We should keep moving forward at least.  
**Suzuka:** Forward? Do you have any idea which way forward is?  
**Maki:** Of course, I don't have any kind of map. But we'll have to rely on our instincts.  
**Maki:** We can't waste a moment finding Yume.  
**Suzuka:** You're right. Somewhere in this place, Yume...  
**Suzuka:** ............  
**Maki:** What is it, Suzuka?  
**Suzuka:** At that time, I told you I would deal with Yume's remains... But I couldn't bring myself to do it...  
**Suzuka:** Because of that, I've caused you so much suffering... I'm sor--  
**Maki:** Don't say that.  
**Suzuka:** ...Eh?  
**Maki:** Everything I've suffered, I did so because I chose this path. None of this is your fault.  
**Maki:** There's no reason for you to feel guilty about anything that's happened to me, Suzuka.  
**Maki:** All I feel towards you is gratitude, for leaving me this chance to save Yume.  
**Suzuka:** Maki-san...  
**Maki:** That's right, Suzuka. There's something I should say too.  
**Maki:** For supporting me when I said I wanted to save her... Thank you so much.  
**Suzuka:** Of course I did. Yume is every bit as precious to me.  
**Suzuka:** ...Maki-san\! We are going to get Yume back.  
**Maki:** Right... For sure.  
**Aradama:** GURURURURRUUUUUUU...\!  
**Suzuka:** -\! There's aradama\!  
**Maki:** Aradama of the netherworld... Let's see how they compare to aradama from our world...  

## 3: Maki and Suzuka (2)
**Suzuka:** The netherworld's aradama are as strong as you'd expect.  
**Maki:** Still, they're no match for us. With you here, Suzuka, I know I don't need to watch my back. I can focus everything on fighting.  
**Suzuka:** Ufufu. I'm honored you have so much faith in me.  
**Maki:** We should keep on moving.  

## 4: Great Aradama "Kai" (1)
**Kofuki:** Looks like we made it to the netherworld in one piece.  
**Kiyoka:** But there's only the seven of us from the investigation team. I don't see Shidou-san or Konohana-san anywhere...?  
**Kofuki:** You think maybe they screwed up and those two died already?  
**Mihono:** Fukki-\! Don't say things like that-\! I'm sure they just ended up somewhere else\!  
**Yui:** When the gate to the netherworld opened, they were standing away from us, weren't they?  
**Mirja:** For the time being, we should search through the netherworld.  
**Chie:** ......  
**Hana:** ...Chie-san. Have you still not made up your mind about saving Yume-san?  
**Chie:** ...Honestly, I'm still opposed to it. When I think of everyone in Mokusa, I can't help but feel that way.  
**Chie:** ...But, if this leads to defeating Tagitsuhime, what all of us in Mokusa fought to accomplish, then I won't hesitate to use Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu's utsushi.  
**Mihono:** --\!\! Guys\!\! Over there\!\! Is that the great aradama we're here for\!?  
**Chie:** That's Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu embedded in its chest... There's no mistaking it...  
**Kai:** Remove from me, this accursed blade... Ahh, how contemptible... You humans... Gghh...  
**Mirja:** ...This is the great aradama we must defeat. And, the true Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu.  
**Chie:** If we beat it, Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu is ours... Not just here in the netherworld, we can bring the real thing back...  
**Mihono:** Guys\! Here it comes\! We're definitely going to win this\!  

## 5: Great Aradama "Kai" (2)
**Kai:** Nghaahh... Am I struck down again... By humans like you...\!\!  
**Mirja:** Go now, Setouchi Chie\! Pierce it with Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu's utsushi\!  
**Chie:** --Hah\!\!  
**Kai:** GAAAAGHH...\! Infuriating... You toji...\!\!  
**Mihono:** You did it\! We did it\! Chii-nee\!  
**Chie:** This is... The real Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu...\!\!  
**Kiyoka:** We finally found it\! We spent all this time looking as the investigation team, and there it is\!  
**Hana:** It was worth risking coming to the netherworld after all.  
**Kofuki:** Heheh. It's been a while since I fought an aradama-chan with some bite to it. So what, should we head back home--  
**Mirja:** No. We aren't finished here.  
**Yui:** What do you mean...? Mirja-san? Ahh, oh right\! We're not done yet\!  
**Mirja:** Until we use the true Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu to free Tsubakuro Yume from the netherworld... Our mission isn't finished.  
**Mihono:** Oh yeah\! Then, we have to hurry and help Shidou-san find Tsubakuro-san\!  

## 6: To Be Burnt in Everyone's Memory (1)
**Suzuka:** ...We haven't seen a trace of the others we came here with...  
**Maki:** This isn't good. If we found the great aradama, without Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu's utsushi, we wouldn't be able to do anything...  
**???:** Aha-\! I found you, some strong looking toji\~\!  
**Suzuka:** ---\!? Yume\!? Is that you, Yume\!?  
**Maki:** Yume...\! Let's go back together... We're taking you back home\!  
**Yume:** Yume...? Back home... To where?  
**Suzuka:** Eh...?  
**Yume:** Who are you onee-sans?  
**Suzuka:** You mean... You don't know... Could Yume's memories have...  
**Maki:** The Yume in the netherworld might have lost her memories of our world.  
**Maki:** Or, if she's forgotten everything about us, she might only have her memories from before taking noro.  
**Yume:** Hey, onee-sans\! This is a world where everyone will remember me as the strongest toji\!  
**Suzuka:** ...? What are you saying?  
**Yume:** I'm the toji who's stronger than anybody else\! And I'll make sure everyone remembers me that way\!  
**Yume:** Watch out\! Yume's behaving strangely\!  
**Yume:** I'll show you two... Why I'm the strongest\!\!  

## 7: To Be Burnt in Everyone's Memory (2)
**Suzuka:** Pant... Pant... It seems... We managed to stop her...  
**Maki:** ...Yume. Come back with us, to the real world.  
**Yume:** No......  
**Maki:** You don't belong in this place. There's another world you're meant to be in.  
**Yume:** ......No\! I haven't done enough yet\! I want everyone to remember me as someone better than this\!  
**Yume:** I don't need anything else\!  
**Suzuka:** Yume...  
**Maki:** I get it, Yume... That's the reason you accepted noro...  
**Kiyoka:** --Ah\! Look over there\! It's Shidou-san and Konohana-san\!  
**Mirja:** Along with Tsubakuro Yume, from the look of things.  
**Kofuki:** So they managed to find her on their own.  
**Yui:** That's great\! ...Wait? It doesn't look like Tsubakuro-san's doing too well though...  
**Hana:** Of course. After all, without the real Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu, Tsubakuro-san can't be freed...  
**Mihono:** Chii-nee...  
**Chie:** ............  
**Mihono:** Chii-nee\!  
**Chie:** ...For everyone in Mokusa.........\!  
**Chie:** Shidou-san\! Take this... The true Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu, and save her...\!  
**Maki:** ......\!  
**Maki:** I'm in your debt\! Someday... I'll pay you back for this\!  
**Maki:** ...Yume\!\! I won't let you stay here alone\! We're going back together\!\!  
**Maki:** To where you belong\!  
**Maki:** HAAAAAAAAHH----\!\!\!  

## 8: A Rescue, a Promise, and Impatience
**Kiyoka:** I think we made it back out safely.  
**Hana:** Ahh\! Look at that\! There's light coming from Tsubakuro-san's body...\!  
**Chie:** Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu's utsushi is stuck in her chest... So then...  
**Mirja:** Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu's utsushi is disappearing from her\!  
**Yui:** What does that mean...? Did we save Tsubakuro-san...?  
**Yume:** ...Huh? Where...? I'm...  
**Maki:** Yume-\! Do you know who I am-\!?  
**Suzuka:** Do you remember me\!?  
**Yume:** Y-Yeahhh... I-It's hard to breathe, when you're hugging me like that...  
**Yume:** ...Maki onee-san, Suzuka onee-san.  
**Suzuka:** Yume\! Yume\!  
**Maki:** Ahh... You know me, don't you, Yume\!?  
**Yume:** Of course... I do. Stop shouting in my ear like that. You're too loud...  
**Yume:** ...Nn. I can't really, move around right.  
**Maki:** In time, I promise you'll be back to normal. You just have to rest now.  
**Suzuka:** Do as we say and stay in bed, Yume. That's your punishment for making us worry so much.  
**Yume:** Ehh\~...? I don't remember doing anything to make you worry though...?  
**Yume:** ---Wait? Maki onee-san, Suzuka onee-san... Why are you... Crying?  
**Suzuka:** Because we were reunited with someone very important to us.  
**Maki:** ......I'm going to go wash my face.  
**Maki:** ......Setouchi Chie. I'll repay you for this someday, I swear.  
**Chie:** ...I haven't forgiven what you people did yet.  
**Maki:** Right, I know that... Actually, I'd rather...  
**Maki:** I'd rather you never forgave what I've done.  
**Maki:** This debt and these sins. I promise I'll return it, I promise I'll pay for them. Believe me.  
**Maki:** I've already sold my soul once, after all. Whatever you want from me, no matter what it is, I'll help you.  
**Mihono:** ...U-Uhh\~, I don't really understand what happened, but everyone's safe and sound, right\! It's all alright\~...  
**Kofuki:** The netherworld was funner than I expected. I got to fight a bigass aradama-chan too. Next time I get the chance, I'm going back.  
**Kiyoka:** I think I'm never doing that again...  
**Chie:** But...  
**Mirja:** That's right. We've lost Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu.  
**Hana:** It was supposed to be the ace up our sleeve when it came to finishing off a great aradama.  
**Yui:** It was. So how're we supposed to defeat Tagitsuhime now? What's going to happen to us now that we can't?  
**Hana:** Huh? Yui, I've never seen you this negative before.  
**Mihono:** Yui, we can come up with a way to stop her together\! After all, the elite guard are on our side now\!  
**Mihono:** With all of us working together... With all us toji on a team...  
**Mihono:** We can do anything\! Where there's a will, there's a way\! Right, guys\!  
**Mihono:** Because after all, you're the ones who taught me that... All my friends\!  
**Mihono:** When I'm with you all, I know there's nothing that can stop us\!  
**Chie:** Mmhm, Mihono-chan's right. We're all here for each other.  
**Kiyoka:** Right. We made it this far, didn't we. There's no use giving up now.  
**Kofuki:** You guys can keep dragging me around so long as there's aradama-chan waiting for me.  
**Hana:** I'm so glad I was given this assignment. ...This is what they call true friendship, isn't it?  
**Yui:** Ahhhhhh... Friendship is so beautiful... The bonds between girls can never be broken, you know... Ahh... Uuuhuhu...  
**Mihono:** With all of us together, no matter what happens, we'll stop Tagitsuhime, I know it\! So let's keep on fighting\!  
**Mirja:** (In the end, President Souraku was never once involved in this operation.)  
**Mirja:** (Despite creating this investigation team, despite entrusting Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu's utsushi to Setouchi Chie... Where is she?)  
**Mirja:** (Ayanokouji Martial Arts School. President Souraku. What is happening to them--)  
**Yukina:** How long do you plan on making us wait\! Hurry up and make your selections from the list of candidates\!  
**Yuzuki:** ......  
**...Strengthening Project Candidate List:** Uchizato Ayumu, Kitora Mirja, Yamashiro Yui, Suzumoto Hana...
