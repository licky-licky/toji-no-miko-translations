=============

## 1: A Self-Centered Request
**Mirja:** Please excuse us\.  
**Akane:** Come in\.  
**Mihono:** Huh\!\?  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.Ah, it's been a whilee\.  
**Chie:** So that's how it was\. You're part of the Hitakami faction too, Hirona-chan\.\.\.  
**Hirona:** I am\.  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.I understand now\.  
**Mirja:** At that time, you came to the investigation team for Asakura Mihono, didn't you\?  
**Hirona:** That's why\.  
**Kiyoka:** When you told us where Kohime-chan was, but you also called Kofuki-san there\.\.\. I thought that was weird\.  
**Hirona:** Yes, I went ahead and made use of Kohime-chan\.  
**Kofuki:** So what, you had us all running around just how you wanted\? Feels messed up\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.It's not exactly like that though\. The only reason Kohime-chan is having fun in Okinawa now is because of Asakura-san and Shichinosato-san's hard work\.  
**Kofuki:** \.\.\.Yeah, you've still got some screws loose\.  
**Mihono:** Hirona, how do you know about how she's in Okinawa\?  
**Hirona:** I actually had a mission to fly to Okinawa and monitor Kohime-chann\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.She seems to be having a good time there, in Okinawa\.  
**Mihono:** Really\.\.\.\? Thanks for letting us know, Hirona\!  
**Chie:** Akane-sama\. About Makoto\.\.\. Hitakami Makoto, where is she\?  
**Yuuki/Akira:** \.\.\.  
**Akane:** That's part of what I need to speak with you about\. Kagutsuchi has transferred inside of Hitakami Makoto-san\.  
**Investigation Team:** \!\?  
**Mihono:** Did that really happen, Akira-san\.\.\.\?  
**Akira:** \.\.\.Yeah, it's real alright\.  
**Akira:** I got no idea what Kagutsuchi did to survive\. But\.\.\. I know that for sure\. Kagutsuchi's taken over Makocchan\.  
**Mihono:** Kagutsuchi took over Hitakami-san\.\.\.  
**Akira:** I know I don't have the right to be saying this\. You don't got any reason to hear me out\.  
**Akira:** Just\.\.\. Please\.  
**Akira:** Help us with her\.\.\. I want to save Makocchan\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** You don't have to bow, Akira-san\! Of course we'll help\!\!  
**Akira:** Mihono\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Right, guys\!  
**Yui:** So long as Mihono-chan won't say anything, it's okay with me\! It's my policy to never turn down a good looking girl\!  
**Kiyoka:** \.\.\.I'm sorry, Hono-chan\. I just can't forgive them that easily\.  
**Kiyoka:** Because, if things had gone wrong, you might not have even been here\.  
**Mihono:** Thanks, Kiyoka\. But, see, I do want to save Hitakami-san\.  
**Kiyoka:** I'll help stop Kagutsuchi\. Just, anything more than that\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.  
**Mirja:** Whatever the case, we can't leave Kagutsuchi out there\. The investigation team will do everything in its power to suppress Kagutsuchi\.  
**Kofuki:** Don't tell me that means we're stuck taking care of you again\.  
**Hirona:** I'll be in your caree\.  
**Akira:** \.\.\.  

## 2: Dissatisfaction
**Akira:** \.\.\.  
**Yomi:** Akira\.  
**Akira:** \.\.\.Yomi\? What's up\?  
**Yomi:** \.\.\.  
**Akira:** Yomi\?  
**Yomi:** Is something wrong\?  
**Akira:** \.\.\.Huh\? What do you mean\? You're the one who came to me\.  
**Yomi:** Right, I came to see you\.  
**Akira:** That's all\? Well, you saw me\.  
**Yomi:** \.\.\.  
**Yomi:** What are you mad about\?  
**Akira:** Huh\? What part of me looks mad to you\? Go on; tell me\.  
**Yomi:** I didn't expect you to be so angry\.  
**Yomi:** With what happened to Hitakami-san, I didn't think you would be calm, but why are you acting like this\?  
**Akira:** \.\.\.Since when did you care so much about other people\?  
**Yomi:** Should I not care about you\?  
**Akira:** \.\.\.Nah, sorry\. Look, you're right\. This is on me\. I'm the one not making sense\.  
**Yomi:** You don't need to apologize to me for that\.  
**Akira:** I don't mean to you\.  
**Akira:** \.\.\.To Mihono\.  
**Yomi:** \.\.\.So you're angry at yourself\.  
**Akira:** Yeah, you got it\. I'm just pissed at myself here\!  
**Akira:** I mean, why shouldn't I be\!\? All I keep doing is shit I can't stand\!\!  
**Yomi:** \.\.\.  
**Akira:** It's not like I regret what we did\! I'm not gonna let anybody say we were wrong to do it\!  
**Akira:** But\.\.\. All the stuff we did, I don't think we did it right either\.  
**Yomi:** Yes, I understand\.  
**Akira:** Like you'd get it\.\.\. or, maybe you would\.  
**Akira:** If you really think about it, what we've been through isn't all that different\. The both of us\.  
**Yomi:** I know\.  
**Akira:** I thought I was gonna take responsibility for all this someday\.  
**Akira:** For everybody who had to test tamayori, and for Mihono\.  
**Akira:** I thought, whatever I did, I'd have to make things right for what happened to them\.\.\.  
**Akira:** But hey, all the responsibility for all that shit, the adults went and took it off our hands\. We don't get to take the blame for anything\.  
**Yomi:** You too\.\.\.  
**Akira:** That's what gets me more than anything; I can't help it\. It's like they're saying, everything we've been doing, we were just dumbass kids messing around\!  
**Yomi:** You need to focus on the things you can still do\.  
**Akira:** Huh\?  
**Yomi:** Even if they take your punishment from you, if there's someone who still needs you, it's all you can do to be there for them\.  
**Akira:** \.\.\.  
**Yomi:** That's how I've been living, Akira\.  
**Akira:** \.\.\.You sure changed\. Used to be a crybaby who'd freak out over namahage\.\.\.  
**Akira:** You got pretty cool\.  
**Yomi:** \.\.\.I still haven't forgiven you for that one time\.  
**Akira:** How many times do I gotta say sorry\?  
**Akira:** \.\.\.Yomi\.  
**Yomi:** What is it\?  
**Akira:** You made some good friends\.  
**Yomi:** \.\.\.I did\.  

## 3: Contact
**Yukari:** \.\.\.Is there still no sign of Kagutsuchi\?  
**Akane:** Nothing\.  
**Akane:** More than likely, I believe Hitakami Genzan is guiding Kagutsuchi for now\.\.\.  
**Akane:** I'm sorry, Nee-sama\. The meeting with the government is about to begin\.  
**Yukari:** I understand\.  
**Yukari:** Kagutsuchi and Hitakami Genzan\.\.\. Where could they have gone to\.\.\.  
**Yukari:** What's going on\?  
**Bureau Personnel:** We've detected a strong aradama signal at Mt\. Choukai in the Tohoku region\. The temperature of the surrounding area is rising abnormally, centered around around the summit\.\.\. and there's signs of a possible eruption\!  
**Yukari:** Prepare units straight away\.\.\.  
**Bureau Personnel:** Th-there's a call\! A call came in from Hitakami Genzan\!  
**Yukari:** \.\.\.So they're the ones approaching us\.  
**Suzuka:** Yukari-sama\! We've been waiting for you\.   
**Yukari:** Put me through to him\.  
**Suzuka:** Yes ma'am\!  
**Yukari:** This is Origami Yukari\.  
**Genzan:** I thought I said I wanted to speak with the current director of the Sword Administration Bureau, Origami Akane\?  
**Yukari:** Origami Akane is currently at a government conference\.  
**Genzan:** Hmph\. Well, no matter\. Origami Yukari will do\.  
**Genzan:** You're aware of what's happening at Mt\. Choukai\?  
**Yukari:** \.\.\.We are\.  
**Genzan:** This is the work of our god, Kagutsuchi-sama\.  
**Yukari:** \.\.\.  
**Genzan:** Beginning here, with Mt\. Choukai, one by one\.\.\. we will show you she is capable of erupting all the active volcanoes across Japan\.  
**Yukari:** State what you're after\.  
**Genzan:** A discussion, Origami Yukari\. We have no intention of fighting the Sword Administration Bureau\.  
**Genzan:** However, with the way things are, we cannot speak as equals\. You still do not recognize the power of Kagutsuchi-sama, after all\.  
**Yukari:** \.\.\.  
**Genzan:** First, you must know\.  
**Yukari:** He hung up\. What do you think, Konohana\?  
**Suzuka:** \.\.\.What he's calling a discussion is simply a threat\.  
**Suzuka:** They'll give enough time for people across Japan to understand what they're capable of, win over supporters, and make it easier for their demands to be met\.  
**Suzuka:** A heavy-handed approach\.  
**Yukari:** \.\.\.I came to the same conclusion\.  
**Yukari:** Their next call, Hitakami Genzan will likely demand Kanayamahime\.  
**Yukari:** But\.\.\. is that really all they're after\?  

## 4: Why
**Genzan:** The plan is coming along well, Kagutsuchi-sama\.  
**Kagutsuchi:** \.\.\.Ahh\.  
**Genzan:** Once the whole of Japan recognizes your power, and the people have rallied behind us, the Sword Administration Bureau will have no other option but to accept our demands\.  
**Genzan:** They are not fools\. They must have assumed Kanayamahime is what you desire\.  
**Genzan:** Neither are they foolish enough to fail to imagine what consequences that would have\.  
**Genzan:** Yet, even knowing that, we will give them no choice but to offer Kanayamahime to you\!  
**Genzan:** And all of this is only possible due to the might of Kagutsuchi-sama\!  
**Kagutsuchi:** \.\.\.  
**Genzan:** There is a chance the Sword Administration Bureau would demand I be given over in exchange for Kanayamahime\. But if that were to pass, I would gladly offer myself for your sake\.  
**Kagutsuchi:** \.\.\.\!  
**Genzan:** GUAAAAAAGHH\!\? K-Kagutsuchi-sama\!\? What are you\.\.\.  
**Kagutsuchi:** \.\.\.Burn\.  
**Genzan:** P-Please, wait\! Why do this\!\?  
**Kagutsuchi:** \.\.\.Silence\.  
**Genzan:** Please, give me an answer, Kagutsuchi-sama\!\!  
**Genzan:** Why--  

## 5: I Can't Do Anything
**Genzan:** Why would you want me dead\!\? Please tell me, Kagutsuchi-sama\!\!  
**Kagutsuchi:** \.\.\.\?  
**Genzan:** Kagutsuchi-sama\?  
**Makoto:** Please, run\.\.\.  
**Genzan:** Is that\.\.\. Makoto\!\?  
**Makoto:** That's right\.\.\. So, while I hold back Kagutsuchi, please\.\.\.  
**Makoto:** Kagutsuchi doesn't think the same as you\.\.\.  
**Makoto:** Kagutsuchi is afraid of toji\.\.\.  
**Makoto:** That's why, because you want to negotiate with them\.\.\. she wants to kill you\.\.\. Run now, while you can\.\.\.  
**Genzan:** \.\.\.I was wrong then\.\.\.  
**Makoto:** What do you mean\.\.\.  
**Makoto:** Eh\?  
**Kagutsuchi:** \.\.\.  
**Makoto:** Gh\.\.\. I'm losing my strength\.\.\.  
**Genzan:** Ohh, that form\.\.\.  
**Makoto:** No\.\.\. Run\.\.\.  
**Makoto:** (What did I--\!\?  I can't move my body\.\.\.\!\!\)  
**Makoto:** (Kagutsuchi must have taken my body back\.\.\. That's right, he was\.\.\.\)  
**Makoto:** (He's gone\.\.\. And, this smell\.\.\. It couldn't be\.\.\.\)  
**Makoto:** (Urgh\.\.\.\)  
**Makoto:** (I can't stay conscious\.\.\. Kagutsuchi's control is too much\.\.\.\)  
**Makoto:** (Kagutsuchi\.\.\. What do you plan to do from here\.\.\.\?\)  

## 6: Votive Lantern
**Suzuka:** Yukari-sama, there's a call from Hitakami Genzan\.  
**Yukari:** Hardly any time has passed since the last one\.\.\. What is he after\?  
**Suzuka:** At the very least, I thought they would go silent for a day\.\.\.  
**Yukari:** True\. The situation may have changed on their end\.  
**Yukari:** Put me through\.  
**Suzuka:** Yes ma'am\.  
**Kagutsuchi:** \.\.\.I demand\.\.\.  
**Yukari:** Hitakami Makoto\.\.\. Then, this is Kagutsuchi\.  
**Yukari:** \.\.\.\? I don't see Hitakami Genzan\.  
**Suzuka:** Maybe she wanted to tell us something in private, away from Hitakami Genzan\?  
**Yukari:** Where is Genzan\?  
**Kagutsuchi:** \.\.\.Dead\.  
**Yukari:** \.\.\.  
**Kagutsuchi:** \.\.\.Kill Asakura Mihono\.\.\. Give Kanayamahime to me\.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Yukari:** We refuse\.  
**Suzuka:** The call was cut off\.\.\. Though, from the state of things\.\.\. and, if Genzan is truly dead\.\.\.  
**Yukari:** \.\.\.  
**Bureau Personnel:** Yukari-sama\! There's reports the temperature around Mt\. Choukai is rising even further\!  
**Suzuka:** She's threatening us\.  
**Suzuka:** If we won't accept her demands, the casualties will get even worse\.\.\.  
**Yukari:** Right\.\.\.  
**Yukari:** Konohana, call together the Special Defense Team\.  
**Suzuka:** Yes ma'am\!  
**Yukari:** Have the presidents of the Five Traditions proceed with making selections for a Kagutsuchi suppression task force\! Contact Bureau Director Origami and have her return immediately\!  
**Bureau Personnel:** Yes ma'am\!\!  

## 7: Kagutsuchi Suppression Task Force
**Akane:** I just made it back\! How is the formation of the suppression task force going\?  
**Bureau Personnel:** President Maniwa is managing the selections\. The details are on this tablet\.  
**Akane:** Let me see\.  
**Bureau Personnel:** Yes ma'am\!  
**Akane:** \.\.\.It's a full blown war effort\.  
**Akane:** The top picks from across the Five Traditions, centered around Etou-san and Juujou-san, then the Special Defense Team\.\.\.  
**Akane:** Followed by\.\.\. The Akabane Swords Investigation Team, Inago-san's group\.\.\.  
**Akane:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Akane:** Please send the Special Defense Team on ahead\. Give them the details en route\.  
**Bureau Personnel:** Understood\.  
**Bureau Personnel:** Should we summon all the listed toji\?  
**Akane:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Akane:** Could you hold off for a moment\? For now, please call Origami Yukari here\.  
**Yukari:** I'm coming in\.  
**Akane:** I'm sorry for calling you, Nee-sama\.  
**Yukari:** What is it\?  
**Akane:** \.\.\.It's about Asakura-san\.  
**Akane:** And, whether she should be included in the suppression task force\.\.\. Could I ask for your opinion, Nee-sama\?  
**Yukari:** First, let me hear what you're thinking, Akane\.  
**Akane:** Alright\.  
**Akane:** \.\.\.Asakura-san is Kagutsuchi's objective\. It would likely be best to move her to a safe location\.  
**Yukari:** If Kagutsuchi were to get ahold of Asakura\.\.\. of Kanayamahime, then we do have no way of knowing how much damage would be done\.  
**Akane:** That's exactly it\.  
**Akane:** And yet\.\.\. At the same time, when considering how to suppress Kagutsuchi, Asakura-san, with Kanayamahime's power, is our secret weapon\.  
**Akane:** Still, that has one problem\. Currently, Asakura-san is incapable of using Kanayamahime's power at will\.  
**Yukari:** Too much for one, too little for the other\.  
**Akane:** What would you do, Nee-sama\?  
**Yukari:** \.\.\.If it were my choice, I would have Asakura participate in the suppression effort\. I have two reasons\.  
**Yukari:** You said that Asakura could not use Kanayamahime's power at will\? But, even ignoring that, Asakura has shown remarkable growth\.  
**Yukari:** The Akabane Swords Investigation Team, with Asakura at their center; I don't consider them any less important than the Special Defense Team\.  
**Akane:** \.\.\.And your other reason\?  
**Yukari:** Right now, there would be nowhere safe to bring her in Japan\.  
**Akane:** That's\.\.\.  
**Yukari:** As time passes, the damage caused by Kagutsuchi will grow\. No one can say for certain\.\.\. whether this can be contained to just Mt\. Choukai\.  
**Akane:** \.\.\.That's true\.  
**Yukari:** In which case, Asakura's strength shouldn't be sent far from the threat, but straight to the frontline\.  
**Akane:** You make a good point\.  
**Akane:** \.\.\.Thank you for giving me your valuable insight, Nee-sama\.  
**Yukari:** Have you made up your mind\?  
**Akane:** \.\.\.I have\.
