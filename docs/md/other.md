# Light Novel
## Ryukyu Kenpu Roku

> On a certain day, in August 2017, Asahina Hokuto, third year middle school student of the Heijou Institute, and Inami Suu, first year middle school student of Renpu Girls' School, land at Naha Airport. They are here to participate in an operational test of the newly developed Storm Armor, produced through the collaborative efforts of both the Sword Administration Bureau and United States military. On that same day, another toji arrives in Okinawa: Tsubakuro Yume, sixth year elementary school student of Ayanokouji Martial Arts School. The girls have no knowledge of and share no connection with each other. For now. This is a record of the hidden conflict these girls encounter, caught in a scheme involving the Storm Armor, as Hokuto, Suu, and Yume, as well as the elite guard and Mokusa, cross swords. This story, taking place one year before the events of the anime, is Toji no Miko's first novelization!
