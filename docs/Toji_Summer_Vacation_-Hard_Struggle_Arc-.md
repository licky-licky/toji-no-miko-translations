## 1: The Hard Summer Vacation to Come
**Mihono:** Wow, it's the sea; you can see the sea from here-! I can't wait; I haven't been to the beach in forever!  
**Kiyoka:** I know! Thank goodness they gave us a summer break! I even bought a brand new swimsuit!  
**Mirja:** I always took you for an indoor type, Musumi Kiyoka. But you seem more excited than usual?  
**Kiyoka:** Ahaha... I was looking forward to this. Getting to do summer vacation things like a normal girl.  
**Mihono:** Mann~, if only the rest of the investigation team could have made it.  
**Mirja:** There's nothing we could do. Setouchi Chie said she was going to Okayama to visit her parents, and Shichinosato Kofuki had no interest in going on a trip.  
**Tanaka Taeko:** We'll be getting off in a minute, everyone. Make sure you don't forget anything.  
**Mihono:** --I won't~! Tanaka-sensei, thanks a lot for taking us here today!  
**Taeko:** It's no trouble, really. Just part of my responsibilities as a grown up.  
**Mihono:** Whoa, you can really smell the saltwater!  
**Taeko:** Mm, the weather's nice. Good thing the skies are clear.  
**Kiyoka:** Let's get changed and get in the water, everyone! We only get to experience this summer once, you know!  
**Mihono:** Ahaha! Kiyoka's really getting into it today! Okay, let me just get my swimsuit on--  
**Beachgoer A:** Hey, I think that's an aradama coming from town!  
**Beachgoer B:** Wait, seriously!? You think it'll come this way...?  
**Beachgoer C:** Let's get out of here! We gotta find a place to hide!  
**Mihono:** Aradama in the town...?  
**Taeko:** I'll confirm this with the Special Ritual Squad! I hate to ask you, but could you three make sure everything's okay in town?  
**Mihono:** Ughh~ Why'd this have to happen nowww~... Alright! We'll be right there!  
**Kiyoka:** Eh, ah...  
**Mirja:** Musumi Kiyoka, we have to hurry!  
**Kiyoka:** O-Okay...!  
**Passerby 1:** Ahhhhh! Help me---!  
**Passerby 2:** Eek! Anybodyyy!  
**Aradama:** GUUOOOOO...!  
**Mihono:** There they are! Aradama!  
**Kiyoka:** Uuu... They really areee~... And there's a lot of them too...  
**Mirja:** We won't have time to wait for support... We'll have to suppress them here!  
**Aradama:** GUAAAAAAAA...  
**Mihono:** Phew... That's the last of them, I think?  
**Mirja:** I'm confirming that all aradama in the area of the town have been eliminated. It should be safe to remove utsushi, for the time being.   
**Riot Officer:** I'm very sorry! You had to take care of this place by yourselves...  
**Mirja:** No... Defeating aradama is our duty, after all.  
**Kiyoka:** Pant, pant... Why didn't any other toji arrive...?  
**Riot Officer:** Several mass outbreaks of aradama were found in the surrounding mountains... All other Special Ritual Squad personnel in the area were sent in to respond.  
**Riot Officer:** The aradama that were sighted here most likely came down from the mountains seeking inhabited areas.  
**Mirja:** You sound understaffed... Have you heard anything from Headquarters? Will they be sending reinforcements?  
**Riot Officer:** About that... They're also lacking toji able to respond here in any hurry, so forming a unit of reinforcements could take some time...  
**Mihono:** Mirja-san, we should go into the mountains to help stop the aradama! We can't risk the chance of them attacking people on the beach!  
**Mirja:** You're right. Then, we will be mobilizing as of now. Our objective is locating the sites of the aradama outbreak, and eliminating them.  
**Kiyoka:** O-Okay~...  
**Kiyoka:** (Awww... My summer vacation~...)  
**???:** Fu Fu Fu...! I didn't expect to encounter them here... This is my chance to gather data on the investigation team members!  

## 2: A Call for Relief and a Hole in the Beach
**Ellen:** Oh! What a beautiful beach!  
**Nene:** Nene, nene-!  
**Mai:** My family's private beach is a little further up ahead.  
**Kaoru:** A private beach... People actually own those in real life... I thought they were just a thing in movies and manga.  
**Hiyori:** I'd heard you came from a rich family, but... No wonder Kanami suggested going to the beach.  
**Hiyori:** Though, Kanami herself isn't even here.  
**Mai:** Well, Kanami-chan did come down with an awful summer cold just before we left...  
**Sayaka:** ...I'm kind of worried about Kanami.  
**Hiyori:** Don't feel bad for her, Sayaka. It's her own fault that she doesn't take care of herself. She even sleeps with her stomach exposed; she's that bad...!  
**Mai:** Ahaha... Hey, Sayaka-chan. Remember what Kanami-chan said? To have a bunch of stories to tell her when we get back.  
**Mai:** If she hears that we weren't having fun because we were worried about her, I'm sure Kanami-chan will feel guilty about it.  
**Sayaka:** ...Okay, I understand. I'll have fun for Kanami then.  
**Kaoru:** Alright, hurry up and get your swimsuits on then--  
**Ellen:** A phone call at a time like this...? Oh... It's from Sana-sensei too.  
**Kaoru:** Geh, I don't wanna hear this...  
**Ellen:** Hii, how's it going, this is Ellen!  
**Ellen:** Okay, okay... Yes, I understand... Then, goodbye.  
**Mai:** Did something come up, Ellen-chan?  
**Ellen:** Sounds like there was a mass outbreak of aradama in the mountains near here.  
**Ellen:** Which means-- Sorry Kaoru, but it's work time.  
**Kaoru:** Tch, what the hell is the Special Ritual Squad doing?  
**Ellen:** This branch and Headquarters are both very shorthanded. If they weren't, Sana-sensei wouldn't have called us while we're on vacation.  
**Kaoru:** Sigh... This sucks. In the first place, are they even gonna make up for how much time this takes?  
**Sayaka:** ...Mai, we should help too.  
**Mai:** Right. I don't want to have come this far only to not spend our vacation together. If we all chip in, it'll go faster--  
**Voice:** Eeeeeek-!  
**Aradama:** GUOOOOOO...!  
**Mai:** Oh no! There's an aradama coming after her!  
**Hiyori:** Leave it to me. I'll handle this. --Haah!  
**Aradama:** GUAAAAAAA...  
**???:** Sigh~, my hero~!  
**Kaoru:** Ah, I know her. She's a 3rd year highschooler, Watanabe Emily. Even in Osafune she's famous for being a weirdo.  
**Emily:** I'm not about to pretend like I didn't hear that! I am not a weirdo; just a bit more stalker-ish than your average person, and brimming with curiosity!  
**Kaoru:** Yeah, that's what makes you a weirdo...  
**Emily:** Tohoho... I was merely sneaking after the investigation team, thinking I could acquire some data on them... How did I end up in such a dangerous situation...?  
**Hiyori:** ...Somehow, I feel like she's not worth the effort.  
**Kaoru:** Let's just leave her here.  
**Ellen:** Of course. Once we're in the mountains, who knows where aradama might attack from!  
**Emily:** I refuse! No matter what it takes, I'll get that data on the investigation team--  
**Ellen:** Heave, ho, heave, ho.  
**Emily:** What's this...? Kohagura-san, why have you started digging a hole in the beach...?  
**Kaoru:** Kukuku, I wonder why-?  
**Emily:** Ah-, you don't mean to...!? ...A-Awawawwawa...!  

## 3: Summer Vacation Belongs to Everyone
**Aradama:** GUUOOOOOO-!  
**Mihono:** Uwawah!?  
**Mirja:** Hah-!  
**Aradama:** GUUUUUUU...  
**Mirja:** Are you unhurt, Asakura Mihono!?  
**Mihono:** Y-Yeah... Thanks, Mirja-san...  
**Mirja:** (This isn't good... The aradama from this outbreak are unusually strong and numerous.)  
**Mirja:** (Asakura Mihono must be nearing the limit of her concentration. And then, Musumi Kiyoka...)  
**Kiyoka:** Pant... Pant...  
**Kiyoka:** (Why did this have to happen...)  
**Kiyoka:** (It's finally summer break... This isn't what I came to the beach for...)  
**Mirja:** Musumi Kiyoka, get hold of yourself! Another group of aradama is approaching!  
**Kiyoka:** Huh...?  
**Aradama:** GUOOOOOO!  
**Kiyoka:** It's got me...!  
**Kiyoka:** (I can't... It's no use...!)  
**Aradama:** Gwaaaaa...!  
**Hiyori:** What do you think you're doing!? Don't look away from your enemy!  
**Kiyoka:** Eh...? Is that you, Juujou-san...!?  
**Hiyori:** Yes. And not just me.  
**Sayaka:** Hup-! Haaah-!  
**Mai:** --Haa-!  
**Aradama:** Gyaaa... aaa...  
**Ellen:** Are you girls from the investigation team okay-!? Sana-sensei sent us to be your backup-!  
**Mirja:** Osafune's President Maniwa... I'm very grateful for your cooperation.  
**Kaoru:** Ah-, save that for when we're done. Damnit, just when I had the free time to mess around at the beach...  
**Mihono:** Wait... You too?  
**Hiyori:** Yes, we're on summer vacation. But we can't just ignore something like this happening.  
**Nene:** Ne-, nene-!  
**Sayaka:** I promised to eat shaved ice on the beach with Mai. So I don't want aradama stopping us.  
**Mai:** Right! And it's not just us; all the regular beachgoers wouldn't be able to enjoy themselves either!  
**Kiyoka:** Juujou-san, Itomi-san, and Yanase-san...!  
**Kiyoka:** (That's right, everyone else is going through this too... I'm not the only one who came here to have a good time... Somehow, I hadn't realized that...)  
**Kiyoka:** (But I can't keep just complaining about it!)  
**Kiyoka:** Hah-- Yaaaaa-!  
**Aradama:** GWAAAaaaaaa...  
**Mirja:** Fu, you've finally gotten serious.  
**Kaoru:** Then let's finish 'em off. If we don't hurry, the tide'll come in.  
**Mihono:** The tide? What about it?  
**Hiyori:** Don't mind us, it's a private matter.  
**Hiyori:** Mihono, have you caught your breath? We need to quickly eliminate them here and keep moving.  
**Mihono:** Y-Yeah!  
**Emily:** Is anybody there-! Can somebody help me-! They buried me in the sand and left; isn't that terrible---!  
**Emily:** Ah... Is it my imagination... Or are the waves creeping ever closer...? Does that mean this spot will be underwater in just a few hours...? Err, I don't have gills last I checked...?  
**Emily:** ...ANYBODYYYYYY---!!!  

## 4: Before the Tide Rolls In
**Aradama:** GUOOOOOOOOO!  
**Mirja:** According to the spectrum finder, these are the last remaining aradama in the mountains! We'll exterminate them here!  
**Mihono:** Got it-!  
**Kiyoka:** Yaaaaah-!  
**Aradama:** GAAAAAAaaaaaa...  
**Mihono:** Nice going...!  
**Mirja:** Suppression of all aradama confirmed. Good work, everyone.  
**Kiyoka:** Eh? Was that the last one?  
**Ellen:** You got so carried away while you were fighting, huh Kiyoka!  
**Kaoru:** Yeah, you went all out. Way to go, you.  
**Kiyoka:** That's all of them...? Then, our summer vacation...  
**Mai:** Ah, that's right! Hey, Musumi-san? It might have been fate running into you here, so would you like to come back to the beach with us?  
**Ellen:** Good idea! I'm all for it, Maimai!  
**Hiyori:** The Yanase family apparently owns a private beach near here. There won't be anyone around, so we can do whatever we want.  
**Sayaka:** And they have shaved ice.  
**Nene:** Nene, nenene-!  
**Kiyoka:** A private beach, with shaved ice...! Oh, but...?  
**Mirja:** Don't worry, Musumi Kiyoka. The Special Ritual Squad will take care of the cleanup work to be done here.  
**Mihono:** Yeah, we don't often get an invitation like this! Let's go, Kiyoka!  
**Kiyoka:** Okay!  
**Kaoru:** ...Oh. Oi, Ellen, what time is it?  
**Ellen:** What time? Well, it's still a while before sunset...  
**Ellen:** Ahhh-! I totally forgot-!  
**Emily:** How could you be so cruellll-! Humans can't breathe underwater, you knowwwwww-!  
**Kaoru:** Uh, my bad, my bad. But it's not such a big deal, right? You only got a little wet.  
**Ellen:** Sorry, we'll bury you a little further away next time.  
**Emily:** Nooooo-! Don't bury me at alllll-!  
**Mihono:** We made it back to the beach so fast thanks to you, Kiyoka. You were really awesome back there.  
**Kiyoka:** You're exaggerating... But...  
**Kiyoka:** I've never had a chance to go on a trip with anyone during summer vacation before...  
**Kiyoka:** But since I became a member of the investigation team, I got to know everyone, so I was really looking forward to this...  
**Kiyoka:** Still, I'm not the only one who felt like that. Nobody wants their precious summer vacation interrupted.  
**Kiyoka:** So when I thought about that, I thought I had to try extra hard for all those people...  
**Mihono:** Kiyoka...  
**Kiyoka:** I'm happy I got to be a member of this investigation team. Because if I hadn't, I just know I never would have realized something so simple.  
**Kiyoka:** So I want to get a lot closer with everyone. Not just the investigation team of course, but with all the people I've met so far...  
**Mai:** Mihono-chaaan, Musumi-saaan! If you don't put your swimsuits on soon, the sun will set before you know it!  
**Mihono:** C'mon, Kiyoka! Here's your chance to get closer to Mai and the rest! Summer vacation's just getting started, after all!  
**Kiyoka:** --Right!  

That night, on a mountain near the coast--
  
**Taeko:** Hmm... I helped the Special Ritual Squad with their after-investigation, but we couldn't find a clue as to the source of the mass outbreak...  
**Taeko:** ...We may need to do a little more research into this area...
