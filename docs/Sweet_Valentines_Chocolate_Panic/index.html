Dispose of it!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> You can get to see my good side too, glasses onee-san! TAAA-!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Geez~, that one wasn&#x27;t even worth it~!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ah! Suzuka-onee-san, look, look. Chocolate really did come out of this aradama I got.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Just as the report said, aradama are targeting chocolate... Or at the very least, they certainly are attracted to it.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...But just because it&#x27;s Valentines season doesn&#x27;t mean even the aradama would become captivated by chocolate.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> It&#x27;s an odd case. Chocolate manufacturers, confectioneries, and department stores have all come under attack from aradama.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> We still don&#x27;t understand why the aradama are seeking out chocolate in the first place.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> But in the meantime, the least we can do is to station toji by stores and factories dealing with chocolate.ã€€<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Yes, I believe you made the right decision by proposing this countermeasure.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> After all, something had to be done about the public&#x27;s feeling of unease. The workers in the shop were very grateful too.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> It was only the reasonable thing to do. Investigating the cause is another part of our mission. For that, I&#x27;d like to depend upon your talent for observation and analysis.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I&#x27;ll do what I can to meet your expectations.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> You two are thinking way too hard about it~. All we have to do is beat up the aradama.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> They&#x27;re all so weak anyway, so just leave it to me and we&#x27;ll be finished before you know it.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> You have a point. What matters most is eliminating the aradama.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Thanks to Yume, we&#x27;ve cleared out the aradama here for the time being. Why don&#x27;t we head on back?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Hey hey, when we get back, I wanna have some cake. I can, can&#x27;t I?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> If you must, but only just a little, alright?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Awesome-!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> (Konohana Suzuka shows quite the soft side toward Tsubakuro Yume, doesn&#x27;t she.)<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Welcome. An advance order? In that case, please fill this out.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Very good, we have your order for a chocolate cake.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> So wait, why are we just working here normally again!?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> With such frequent appearances of aradama, we would waste too much time arriving otherwise.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> And serving customers is unexpectedly entertaining, isn&#x27;t it?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> It&#x27;s certainly a more worthwhile use of our time than idly waiting for aradama to appear.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh, but we could just eat cakes while we wait. The ones they have here are pretty good.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> You were greeting customers earlier though, Yume.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I got bored of that. It&#x27;s no fun.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> However, it&#x27;s a good experience. As toji, we rarely have opportunities to participate in normal customer service work.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Welcome... Oh, it&#x27;s you.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Hi! It&#x27;s your customer and also helper, Kohagura Ellen!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> You know, I never thought I&#x27;d see an ojou-sama like Hanahana serving customers like this!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> If you had to say one way or the other, would you not consider yourself an ojou-sama as well?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Mmmm, well, I&#x27;m nothing compared to someone like Maimai, right?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> I don&#x27;t exactly have the essence of an ojou-sama.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Now, Miss Shopkeeper, what do you recommend for me?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Let me see... As it is the Valentines season, we have many chocolate products. However, these pear tarts do have quite the flavor.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> In that case, I&#x27;ll take one of those~.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ah, Suzuka-onee-san! I wanna eat one too!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> You just had that strawberry shortcake, didn&#x27;t you? You&#x27;ll spoil your dinner.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Bleh. Fine, I&#x27;ll wait till tomorrow.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yes, that&#x27;s fine then.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> (But not just soft, it seems. And Tsubakuro Yume doesn&#x27;t always behave so spoiled either.)<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> (It&#x27;s true after all, there are some sides to relationships that can&#x27;t be seen until you get close.)<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> We get to do a different job than usual while still performing our duty as toji. It feels weird; sort of exciting, don&#x27;t you think?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> So let&#x27;s have as much fun with it as we can!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Yes, I&#x27;m glad to have you helping us. Let&#x27;s settle this matter, along with discovering the underlying cause behind the aradama&#x27;s behavior.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> As there are four of us now, why not work in two man teams from here on out? It would be more efficient that way.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I don&#x27;t object to the idea.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I&#x27;m fine with whatever. But I&#x27;d be fine on my own too.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Don&#x27;t say that, Yumecchi. We never get a chance like this, so I want to pair up with you!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> With you, Onee-san? Sure, that might be kind of fun.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="2-chocolate-panic-epilogue"></a>2: Chocolate Panic Epilogue<a class="hash-link" href="#2-chocolate-panic-epilogue" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I won&#x27;t allow any further disturbance from you--<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> --HAAH-!!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> An impressive swing! Good job, Hanahana.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> It was nothing so remarkable. Now then, Yume, what was it this time?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Just more ribbons and boxes. Haven&#x27;t most of them been like this lately?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> At the start, it seemed only chocolate would come from these aradama, but we&#x27;ve gathered a mountain of packaging supplies by now...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Looking at it statistically, we should recognize that their goal was not chocolate itself, but materials to package chocolate.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> From the reports, it appears the factories of chocolate manufacturers have seen a steady reduction of damages.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> In their place, cases of department stores and sweets shops being attacked for their packaged chocolate gifts have risen...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> But I&#x27;ve heard that, thanks to all the toji working so hard, the phenomenon with these aradama is going back to normal!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Is there any truth to that, Hanahana?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I&#x27;m very curious as to hear where you heard that, but we will indeed be returning to normal alert status starting today.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> In fact, the rate of aradama appearances has dropped to the extent that the four of us could act simultaneously even in this large shopping mall.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Really? So that means, we won&#x27;t get to wear those uniforms much longer. I&#x27;m a little disappointed.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> You did look very nice in it.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Oh yeah, so what was with the aradama stealing packaging supplies anyway?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Unfortunately, we were never able to discern the reason behind that...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> What if, maybe the aradama also just wanted a gift of chocolates from someone?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh, but they&#x27;re aradama?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Well like they say, a gift comes from the heart.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Think about it, Yumecchi. It feels good to get a present, so, if you had the chance, you&#x27;d gladly take one, right?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Sure I guess...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> That&#x27;s a somewhat poetic viewpoint, but I suppose even aradama can be charmed by certain things.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> We can speculate all we want, but there&#x27;s no clear answer. The noro has been recovered, so let&#x27;s return to the shop.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Thank you very much.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> As soon as we&#x27;ve become used to dealing with customers, the time has come to leave this store.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I know. It gave us some trouble, but it was a rather fulfilling mission; offering a valuable experience working with customers.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> More than anything, I&#x27;m sad there wasn&#x27;t one of those cute uniforms to wear in my size.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> By the way, you had one of the workers here help teach you how to make chocolate sweets, didn&#x27;t you, Hanahana?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Were you going to make a gift for somebody?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I only saw it as an opportunity to learn from a professional... Well, it might be nice to try making someone a present.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> What about you; are you going to give someone chocolate?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> I&#x27;ll give some to Kaoru, of course! The cakes here are delicious that I already made a reservation.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I got a lot of chocolate too, so I think I&#x27;ll share some with Yomi-onee-san. Just a little though.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Oh... A text message from someone? Please excuse me.<br>
<strong>From Yamashiro Yui:</strong> Hello, Mirja-san!<br>
It&#x27;s almost Valentines, you know. So why not give some chocolate to your cute kouhai who works so hard every day!</p><p>Some chocolate, filled up with your love, for Valentines Day, if you please!</p><p>If you feed it to me while I say ahhh, I&#x27;ll swear to you my eternal loyalty, no, love! So--</p><p><strong>Mirja:</strong> Huh... At some point, Yamashiro Yui must have gotten my contact information...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Well, regardless... This is something that would be best to ignore.<br>
