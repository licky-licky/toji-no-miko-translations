It's been quite some time since we met at a social gathering.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> That's true. Lately, I've been spending more time on battlefields... Are you here accompanying your father as well, Konohana-san?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yes, networking is invaluable, after all. Meetings like this allow you to keep up with many people.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> And deepening your connections is never a waste.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> For the sake of the Konohana family, and more precisely, for my own sake.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> You've always had your act together. Compared to you, I--<br><strong>Woman:</strong> Kyaaaaa--!! L-Look outside; an aradama!!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> What was that!?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> What's it doing out here...?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> We can think about that later. First, we need to destroy that aradama. Will you help me?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Yes, of course!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Then, we shouldn't waste time. Let's show this aradama where it's not welcome.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Nicely done. Thankfully, we were able to deal with this before it became a serious incident.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I ended up on another battlefield, in the end.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> You're right, now that you mention it. Perhaps that's the fate of us toji.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> But, leaving that aside, you were about to say something strange before we were interrupted, weren't you?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Something strange? Sorry, I don't really remember?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> "You've always had your act together. Compared to you, I--".<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Surely you don't mean to imply you haven't been an accomplished person yourself?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I'm not implying anything; that's just how it is...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> That joke isn't as funny as you think.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> There aren't many who could repeat the way you handled your okatana just now.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> That beautiful swordsmanship could only belong to one who thoroughly dedicated herself to training every day.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Therefore, please have more confidence in yourself. Your worries only weaken your resolve.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Konohana-san... Thank you very much.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> You don't need to thank me.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Now then... The party seems to still be open. I should take my leave.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Farewell, Yanase-san. Until we meet on another battlefield.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Yes! Until we fight together again.  </p><h2 id="2-the-ojou-sama-is-a-commoner" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>2: The Ojou-sama is a Commoner</h2><p><strong>Maki:</strong> What are you having for lunch, Suzuka?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> As for me, I've prepared this.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> That's... Another convenience store bento? How many days in a row is that?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Unfortunately for you, that's wrong. This isn't a convenience store bento, but rather a bento from the supermarket's deli corner.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> And would you look at this, right here! I found it at a 30% discount! Such great value, isn't it?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> The ojou-sama is bragging about bargain bin deals...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I can't overlook that. I've never once thought of myself as an ojou-sama, you know.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> If you aren't one, then what even is an ojou-sama?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> I've heard rumors that, in middle school, you rode in a different luxury car to school every day.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...? What's so strange about that?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> So it's true!? Why would you change cars every day? And luxury cars too!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I'm sorry? You're the one saying strange things now. You change clothing every day, don't you? Why would cars be any different?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Of course it's different!! Don't compare cars costing tens of millions of yen to clothes...!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> But outfits costing several tens of millions of yen aren't all that uncommon, are they?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Your sense of money's insane... That reminds me. There's another rumor you were running late one day, so you had a helicopter airlift you to school.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> That's a misunderstanding. Even I've never flown in a helicopter to school.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> It figures, that one's just idle gossip...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yes, a helicopter wouldn't have made it in time. I rode a Harrier instead.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Isn't that a fighter jet!? I knew it; you're an ojou-sama among ojou-samas.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> But I think I'm fairly ordinary, though?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Do I even want to know your definition of ordinary...?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Still, I'm surprised you not only go to convenience stores, but supermarkets too. Or do you have someone get these for you?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I'd never have someone do that for me. You must not be aware, Maki-san. Of how wonderful the supermarket is.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> The shelves are brimming with an endless variety of foods, and simply browsing through their collection of sweets is a joy.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> There's so much to see that I could spend half a day there without losing interest in the slightest.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Ah, I know! If you'd like, will you join me next time? I can guide you around.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> S-Sure...  </p><h2 id="3-suzukas-duties" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>3: Suzuka's Duties</h2><p><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Excellent work. I'd expect no less from you, Yukari-sama. Even while negotiating with such veteran ministers, you didn't give an inch. It was a valuable learning experience.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> With this, we should be able to act more freely. Another step toward my ideal.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> We can begin as soon as this bill takes effect. I'll need you working harder than ever from here.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I'm well aware. I'll gladly do everything I can to make your plans a reality, Yukari-sama.<br><strong>Man:</strong> .........<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> What are you doing? Clear the way, you're being disrespectful.<br><strong>Man:</strong> ORIGAMIIIII!!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Hm, an insurgent?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I won't allow it.<br><strong>Man:</strong> GYAAAHH!!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Don't worry, I merely used the back of the blade. I wouldn't dirty Kujikanesada with the blood of a common rebel, after all.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Honestly, for one as helpless as you to make an attempt on Yukari-sama's life was hopelessly naive.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> With an overambitious plan, someone must have put you up to it, didn't they?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Prepare yourself. I'll have you tell me everything.<br><strong>Man:</strong> ....Ghkhg!!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Wha!? What are you doing!?<br><strong>Man:</strong> .........<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> He's dead... It seems he prepared a suicide capsule in the back of his teeth.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> This is inexcusable. To have lost such a valuable witness right from under me... Yukari-sama, I'll accept any punishment you give.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> There's no need. I have no interest in every insect crawling the ground in my way.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> As my desires are realized, many more like him will be flushed out. They're not all worth my attention. Leave him where he lies.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...Understood.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Now then, come with me.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yes! Wherever you go, I will be at your side!  </p><h2 id="4-the-time-we-spent-together" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>4: The Time we Spent Together</h2><p><strong>Maki:</strong> What's the matter; your attacks are getting softer. Tired already?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Funny, coming from you. Your footwork is already slipping, Maki-san.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Now you've said it. How about this!?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Kuh...! How much longer can you go on!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Hah--!!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Oh, that was a good strike. For practice, you're sure coming at me with a lot of passion. Reminds me of when we first met!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> And you're taking this awfully casually, to go reminiscing about the past!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> That's not true. I'm barely holding my ground.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> (She's always grinning like that. Back then, I hated that smile from the bottom of my heart.)<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> (Maki-san's okatana, "Usumidori", is of special importance to practitioners of Kurama-Ryu. I was deeply jealous of her.)<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> ("Usumidori" was much more suited to be mine. I challenged her in the tournament, intending to prove that, but it ended in my defeat.)<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> (With my pride deeply wounded, my spite for her only grew stronger. I swore I would someday surpass her.)<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> (I even followed her as far as joining the elite guard.)<br><strong>Maki:</strong> What are you smiling about?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Smiling? I was?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Yeah. I couldn't believe it myself, but while you were fighting so passionately you had such a gentle smile on your face.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Seriously, you're the one taking this casually, aren't you?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I was simply reflecting on the past a little, is all.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> The past? I must not be a serious opponent for you, if you can happily walk down memory lane in the middle of a fight.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Isn't that the case for you, Maki-san? You've done nothing but win against me lately. You have to be taking me lightly by now.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Suzuka, to me you're a close friend I know I can rely on. But at the same time, I see you as my rival.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Every day I'm trying desperately not to be outdone by you. You never give me a spare moment to take you lightly.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...!? You're always going on like that... Then, today's the day I overtake you!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Not going to happen. Even in practice, you're the one person I never want to lose to!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> That's what I wanted to say! Regardless of anyone else, I have no intention of giving you an easy victory!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yah---!!  </p><h2 id="5-the-one-at-your-side" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>5: The One at Your Side</h2><p><strong>Naeba Wakako:</strong> Suzuka-sama, isn't it about time we took a rest?<br><strong>Wakako:</strong> The sight of you at work is lovely enough to touch my heart, but without rest your body will start to suffer.<br><strong>Wakako:</strong> If your body were to give out on you... I wouldn't be able to go on living!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> You're always so dramatic. But, I do happen to be at a good stopping point. Let's pause here for now.<br><strong>Wakako:</strong> Suzuka-sama, um, here... Try these, if it suits you.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> My, what delicious looking tarts. Just look at how the fruits are glistening. Where did you find these?<br><strong>Wakako:</strong> There's a shop I often see featured in magazines; they made them. Actually, these tarts are so famous they regularly sell out the moment the shop opens.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Really? You did well in getting them then.<br><strong>Wakako:</strong> Yes, I was waiting in line since three this morning!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Y-You arrived that early?<br><strong>Wakako:</strong> I worked my hardest to ensure you could eat them, Suzuka-sama!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I appreciate your dedication, but there's no need to go to such unreasonable lengths. It would be a serious issue if you came down ill as a result.<br><strong>Wakako:</strong> Suzuka-sama is worried about me... My heart feels like it could leap from my chest! I think I could live the rest of my life on those words alone!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Fufu, you sure love to exaggerate.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Sorry to interrupt. Suzuka, I brought orders for you.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Ara, Maki-san, you didn't have to come all this way to deliver them.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> It's a part of the job; don't worry about it. I skimmed over it earlier. Our next mission seems fairly challenging.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Ara, are you losing your nerve? Don't worry, I'll cover your share of the work if you need me.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Who said anything like that!? I only wanted to warn you it looks difficult! It won't be a problem for me!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Is that so? In any case, you can always depend on me being there to support you.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> That's what I should be saying...<br><strong>Wakako:</strong> ...I'm really not fit to be the one standing at Suzuka-sama's side, am I. She looks so much more splendid together with Maki-sama...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Hm? Were you saying something, Wakako?<br><strong>Wakako:</strong> N-N-No! Pay no attention to me.  </p><h2 id="bride-19-start-undercover-investigation-suzukas-case" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Bride '19: Start]: Undercover Investigation (Suzuka's Case)</h2><p><strong>Maki:</strong> An undercover investigation?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yes, we will be going undercover.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Another report has come in from that wedding chapel of an aradama stealing a wedding ring.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Which means, someone will have to dress like a bride to lure the aradama out?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Should we defeat the aradama there though? Shouldn't we work to get the stolen ring back?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> No, we have a ring equipped with a transmitter, so we only need the aradama to steal it.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> I see, that makes sense.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> So you'll be the bride, the aradama will steal the ring, we track where it goes, and this will all be solved.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Eh!?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Did I get something wrong?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> N-No... Only, I'll be the bride? The members from the previous mission have all been gathered...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Of course, if there's a chance you'll be in danger, I'll be right there to protect you. But wouldn't it be best if we were the ones doing the dangerous work?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Y-You do have a point.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> And besides, instead of someone like me, you'd make a much more convincing bride, Suzuka.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> V-Very well then. I'll play the bride to the best of my ability.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> There, I've put it on. Hopefully it can convince the aradama I'm a true bride...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> (Nonetheless...

On average, brides enjoy compliments.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> You look very nice, Konohana-san.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Well, I do appreciate the flattery.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> But more importantly, have either of you seen Maki-san around?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Shidou-san? I haven't seen her.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I spoke with her a little about our patrols.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> How long ago was that?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Only a few minutes ago. She went to look for where security was light.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Light security... Thank you, Yomi-san.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> If she went to where there was little security, this should be a likely area...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Oh, Konohana-sa... Wow, that's so pretty.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Hanahana, you look amazing in that wedding dress!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I wish I could wear one too!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Fufu, thank you.

You want Shidou-san to see you in your wedding dress, don't you!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> All I want is to perform our mission, which I need to find her for.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...Musumi-san? We mustn't confuse our private interests with our duties.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I-I'm sorry.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Please focus your attention on securing the area, will you?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...Really now, it's all because Musumi-san had to say something strange that I'm somewhat nervous again...

Looks like you're done getting changed.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Y-Yes.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> There's been no sign of anything here. The spectrum finder hasn't responded either, so it doesn't seem like the aradama is around.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Suzuka?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Ah, it's nothing... Its target must be the ring after all.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> That's right, we should get it ready now.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yes.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> (Honestly, why did I expect anything more from Maki-san... I feel like a fool for ever getting nervous.)<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Suzuka?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I'll have the ring ready in a moment.

Do you see it on the spectrum finder?<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> ...Ggii.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> There it is.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> (Rather than giving chase now with the two of us, it would be more effective to form a pincer attack. If these aradama are truly after the chocolate, then it shouldn't run to the other floors, but instead to the food court.)<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> (There is only one route it can take to there. Our strategy should be for Kitora Mirja to circle around, and--)<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I'll circle around to the food court! Konohana Suzuka, you drive the aradama forward. As a precaution, I'll contact Kohagura and Tsubakuro as I move.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> !<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Good, I won't object to that.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Destroying them is most important, however--<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> ...GGGIII-!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> It won't make it so easy, will it.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Though, even if you run, I'll guide your every move.<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> GSHAA---!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Just as planned. It's coming directly here.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> However, I won't so lenient as to let such a mindless charge through!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Well done.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Bringing it down was nothing. You had the more difficult role of guiding it here.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> It might have been on the run, but that aradama would have only gone to where the chocolate is located, so it was hardly a challenge.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I see. Though, shouldn't you have been able to bring that aradama down?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> There are many things left unconfirmed about these aradama, so I decided to rely on the more certain method of a pincer attack. If you hadn't proposed the idea, I would have.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I realize we are operating in two man teams during this mission, but it's been simple to carry out with how clear each other's intentions are.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I felt the same. I can follow on your sensible instructions without hesitation. The elite guard must operate very smoothly.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I never give detailed instructions to the elite guard.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> The primary role of the elite guard is to escort Yukari-sama, so when carrying out large scale operations, I and Maki-san will take command of our own units.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Now that you mention it, that is certainly true. Hm...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> While we are on the topic of the elite guard, what sort of person is Shidou Maki? How do you see her?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Eh? W-What do... you mean by that...?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I have somewhat of an interest in Shidou Maki myself.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I'm not sure if you are aware, but in the tournament the year before last, I was defeated by her.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> As I see her, she is a straightforward toji with a single-minded strength. Every one of her strikes had great force behind it.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> However, as someone who is close at her side, I was wondering if you had a different impression.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Is that all you meant. Though, I don't think my impression differs much from yours? There's no hidden side to speak of when it comes to Maki-san.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Well, if I had to name something, she can be quite dense at times.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Is that so? She doesn't at all give that impression when fighting.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Thank you for answering such a trivial question of mine.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> It was nothing.

It won't be an issue for you to teach them to me, will it?<br><strong>Patissier:</strong> Well, it shouldn't be a problem so long as you don't go spreading online that it was our shop that taught it to you.<br><strong>Patissier:</strong> We're very grateful to all you toji. You're spending your spare time helping us, aren't you?<br><strong>Patissier:</strong> It's probably because you're all so cute, but we're selling more chocolate this year than usual.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Well now. In that case, I'll gladly learn what you have to teach me.<br><strong>Patissier:</strong> Then, we can do it after we close up for the day. But, you must be tired from your duties, so don't push yourself, okay?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Of course; thank you for your concern.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> We're back-! I had a pretty exciting experience, fighting with Yumecchi out there.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Really? I was just fighting like I normally do~.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> You were really leading the way with how we were fighting before. It seems like anyone would have a hard time keeping up with you.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ah, now that we're here, I wanna eat some cake!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> That's a good idea! I'm a little hungry myself.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> What should I have today~? Mont blanc? Or pudding a la mode... Mmm, I think I'll go with the strawberry rare cheesecake after all~.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Strawberry is one of your favorites, isn't it, Yume. You like Ichigo Daifuku Neko as well, don't you?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Yeah, I guess it is~.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Once you've finished eating, can I count on you to help us with managing the shop?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I'll go ahead and get changed first.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Sure sure-. You don't have to worry about me-.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Thank you very much for your order. We hope to see you again.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Thank you very much~...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Suzuka-onee-san, is it me, or are you acting extra excited today?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I don't think that's the case? This is how I always am.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh, but I feel like something's different for sure-. Ah, maybe you got a special kind of cake!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> If I had gotten a cake like that, I would have shared it with you, Yume.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Hmm, I guess you would've. Then maybe I imagined it? But still...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> (I should have expected no less from Yume... She's so perceptive when it comes to the strangest things. I think it would be fine to tell her about being taught the tricks to making chocolate though.)<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> (But, until Valenties day, I cannot allow Maki-san to find out.)<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> (I'm only erring on the side of caution. Sorry, Yume.)<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> (I'm sure the store's products would be more delicious, but I'm a bit interested in seeing Maki-san's reaction when I tell the chocolates I gave her are homemade.)<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Though, it is Maki-san after all. I'm sure she's no stranger to homemade chocolate.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> What's that about Maki-onee-san?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Nothing at all.

We picked out a great present thanks to you. I'm looking forward to surprising her with it. But, what about it?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> You see, I had hidden it in the back of the record room so that Yomi-san wouldn't find it until the 24th...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Don't tell me she found it!?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> No, I was able to retrieve it just in time, but Yomi-san' intuition is sharp. I'm not quite sure how to keep it a secret until the day of.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> I get it. You're right, that's an important discussion to have.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> To begin with, anywhere we can enter, Yomi-san freely enters as well...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> And if we kept it in our living quarters, Yume would likely find it whenever she comes in to play around.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> In previous years, we prepared it together with Yume, so the three of us could have kept it a secret between us.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> But she went and said she'd do something on her own this year. I want to keep it secret from Yume too if possible...<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Konohana-san, you were in here?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Y-Yomi-san!
