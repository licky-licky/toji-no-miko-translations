If you keep running like that you'll bump into something. Be more careful.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> But I'm just so excited that we're all out shopping together.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Sniff, sniff... Something smells nice. Oh, they're selling crepes! Sayaka-chan, when we're done shopping, we should get some crepes.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm, they look tasty.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> They have so many flavors that it seems hard to choose just one. Sayaka-chan, pick up a menu so we can take our time thinking about it while we're out.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Okay. They all look good... Nn? Pumpkin flavor... I've never seen that before.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Look, look! That store over there is selling witch costumes and magic staffs. They look really well made.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah, those pumpkin decorations over there are cute too.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> More pumpkins... Why...?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> That's right, it'll be Halloween soon, won't it?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I've heard of that, but I've never done it. Halloween... What is it?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> It's a day where you put on costumes, go around town collecting sweets, and eat a feast of pumpkins.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Sweets... Feast... Gulp.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I know. Why don't we invite all the toji to a Halloween party?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Party?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> That sounds fun! Let's do it, let's do it, let's throw a big party!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> And while we're at it, why don't we get some costumes here too?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> That could be fun! I wonder what kind of costumes would suit everyone.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I saw a black cat costume in that store earlier. Hiyori would look good in it.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Now that you mention it... A black cat would be perfect for Hiyori-chan. I want to bring it back to her as a present now.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> If Hiyori-chan is a black cat, Kaoru-chan would be... What about a wolf?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah, she's look so cute like that! Now Ellen-chan has such a nice figure, so anything would fit her... I know, she could be a miniskirt nurse!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Isn't that just cosplay, Kanami-chan...?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ahaha, you're right. But I still think it'd look good on her.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Sayaka-chan, what kind of costume do you want to wear?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I'll just wear what I normally do...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ehh, but you could wear all kinds of cute clothes, Sayaka-chan.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> You can't dress normal to a Halloween party?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> You can wear whatever you want. Even if it's only a party with a big feast and lots of cookies, it'll be a lot of fun.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> A feast with cookies... I want to try it.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Really? Then I can make some delicious Halloween food for you and everyone else.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> A party where Mai-chan's cooking! I know everyone will want to come. You don't have to wear a costume, Sayaka-chan, so you'll come too, right?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm. If I get to eat Mai's cooking, I'll go.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> In that case, we should start the party preparations straight away.  </p><h2 id="2-shopping-for-the-party" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>2: Shopping for the Party</h2><p><strong>Mai:</strong> Sorry to make you come grocery shopping with me, Kanami-chan, Sayaka-chan.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Don't worry about it! We can't make you do all the preparations for the party by yourself, you know.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm. Kanami and I will do anything to support the feast you're making.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Thank you, both of you. If there's anything you can think of you want to eat, feel free to make any requests.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Allllright. Then, I want fried chicken, and sushi, and ice cream, and...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> None of that is very Halloween-y though... But I'll try coming up with ways to make those Halloween themed.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mai, that apple pie looks tasty.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> It does, doesn't it? I know, how about instead I bake you a pumpkin pie?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> You can make pie from pumpkins...? If Mai makes it, I want to eat it.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Then, could you go and get me one pumpkin?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Okay.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Mai-chan, Sayaka-chan, check out these fried croquettes. Don't they look good!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> A pumpkin croquette could work too. Kanami-chan, could you get another pumpkin?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> On it!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Here you go!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> With pumpkin I can make pie and croquettes, then gratin... Thanks to you two, this menu is starting to come together.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> It all sounds tasty. I'll get more pumpkins.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I'll help you out. We should get one for pumpkin salad, one for pumpkin gratin, one for pumpkin pudding, one for pumpkin soup... And then some more too.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> There's so many pumpkins in the cart. They all look good, but I don't know how we can eat this much...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Huh? Kanami! And Mai and Sayaka too.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> What a coincidence. Are you shopping too?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Yep, that's right.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> But... What's up with your cart? What are you gonna do with all those pumpkins?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> We were thinking of doing a Halloween party, so this is for that. Do you two think you can come?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Can we? Of course I'll be there! I'm going for sure. Can I invite the others too?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Go right ahead! I'll look forward to having more people sample my cooking.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Yanase-san, does that mean you'll use all those pumpkins in cooking for the party?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Yes. We mostly have the menu planned out now. But if there's anything else you want to eat, tell me and I'll write it down.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> What, all of these? You're really going all out on this party.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Yanase-san, are you planning on doing all the cooking by yourself?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> It's a lot of work to do alone, so Sayaka-chan and I were going to help her.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Wow-! You can cook too, Kanami?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> W-Well, I'm not that good at it... What about you, Sayaka? You've got fast hands, so you seem like you'd be a natural at cooking.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Cooking... How do you cook?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Fufu. Yanase-san, if it's no trouble for you, do you mind if I help cook?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> No, I can't make you do that. I want everyone to enjoy this party, but if you're stuck helping out it defeats the purpose.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Don't worry about that. Besides, if you want everyone to enjoy this party, you should be having a good time too, shouldn't you?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> If you wear yourself out doing all the cooking, you'll be too busy to enjoy the party, Yanase-san.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Setouchi-san...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> You should take her up on that, Mai. Chii-nee's cooking is super yummy, you know?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> In that case, could I please ask you to help me get things ready?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Sure, just leave it to your onee-san.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Nice. Between Chii-nee and Mai's home cooking, there's no way I'm missing this party!  </p><h2 id="3-mai-and-chies-cooking-classroom" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>3: Mai and Chie's Cooking Classroom</h2><p><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ahh, we're finally back... I never thought the supermarket could feel so far away from school before.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Pumpkins sure are heavy. Are you really going to be able to use all these?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Don't worry, Yanase-san and I will be sure to turn them all into delicious food. Right, Yanase-san?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> That's right.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Now then, why don't we get to work on getting these pumpkins ready?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I'll lend a hand. What do you need help with first?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> We need to cut the pumpkins for every item on the menu, so... How about this! Before we start cooking, why don't we all make jack o' lanterns?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Good idea, we need to scoop out the insides for cooking anyway.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> And it'll start feeling more like Halloween!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mai, how do you make a jack o' lantern?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> First, you need to cut out the bottom of the pumpkin. Then you use a spoon to pull out all the seeds and everything inside.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> It's tough, so be careful not to hurt yourself with the kitchen knife.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Okay, I can handle that!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah, let's give it a shot.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Nngh... Ughhh, she's right. I can't get the knife through the outside...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Mmghhh, I got the knife in, but I can't go any further than that... Ughh, where there's a will... There's a way!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Aghhh, I give up. It's not budging an inch.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mai, I finished cutting through the bottom. What do I do now?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> You finished already, Sayaka-chan? Eh, that's amazing! You cut through it so cleanly.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> You're really good at this, Itomi-san; cutting through the tough pumpkin like that.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> How'd you do that, Sayaka-chan? Show us your secret!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Secret?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> If you use your okatana... It's easy.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> S-Sayaka-chan...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Oh yeah, I didn't think of that.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Yep, with my okatana, I'm not afraid of any pumpkin! Let me try.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Ha-Hang on a minute. It's true that okatana are sharp, but why don't we try sticking to kitchen knives for cooking?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I agree! Since we have the chance, wouldn't using a cooking knife make for good practice in the future...?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> If Mai says so, then I'll do it.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> I'll help show Mihono-chan and Etou-san how, so why don't you look after Itomi-san, Yanase-san?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Alright. Take care of Kanami-chan for me.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Mmhm, just leave it to your onee-san.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> (Setouchi-san is so reliable and wonderful...)<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mai, how should I hold the kitchen knife?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Let's see, when you're cutting something tough, put your hands on the back of the knife and the handle, and little by little push down using the weight of your body.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I'll try that. Nng... It's hard.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> You're doing it, Sayaka-chan. Just like that, nice and slowly.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Ah, the phone. Yes, hello... Eh, there's aradama nearby? Okay, we'll be right there.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Aradama? I was just getting used to the kitchen knife, but it sounds like it's time to trade it back for my okatana.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Right. We should all go.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Wait, it sounds like there aren't many aradama this time, so there's no need for every one of us to go.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Okay then. Why don't the three of us go, and you and Mai-chan can stay and cook?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Sounds good to me. We'll take care of the aradama, so Chii-nee and Mai can keep cooking up that feast!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I won't lose to aradama.

I like the cute shapes you cut them in.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> When they look like this, even children who won't eat carrots might eat them. My little sisters are picky, but I can get them to eat this way.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> You're a good sister, Yanase-san.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I-I don't know about that...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> I'll get the pie crust ready, so could you take the pumpkin that's in the steam cooker out and crush it?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Okay.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> And, counting backwards from when we need it freshly baked, it might be better to start heating up the oven now.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Good idea.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> (Setouchi-san is amazing. She isn't only good at cooking, but her instructions are perfect too.)<br><strong>Mai:</strong> (Compared to her, I have such a long way to go... I have to pick up the pace so I'm not holding her back.)<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Setouchi-san, I'll chop the onions for you.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Oh, you're so good with that knife. But you shouldn't be in such a hurry. Your eyes won't hurt as much if you give them time to recover.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Thank you for your concern. But, I feel fine.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> (My eyes actually do hurt a little... But if I take a break, then Setouchi-san will get worried about me. I just need to bear with it a little longer.)<br><strong>Chie:</strong> You really are good at this though, I mean it. It's beautiful the way you can go so fast, yet they all come out the same size.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Thank you very much. I use a kitchen knife every day, so I'm used to it...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Ow-!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Eh, Yanase-san, what's wrong!? Are you okay?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Sorry, I was just a little clumsy.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Did you cut yourself?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I'm fine. Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you like that.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> I'm just glad to hear you're okay. You don't need to rush yourself.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I know. Then, I'll get back to work now.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> (Uuuu, the cut is stinging... But, it's too embarrassing telling Setouchi-san I cut myself while I was trying to show off to her, so I just have to hold it in...)<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Yanase-san? Let me see your hand. Ah, like I thought, you're bleeding.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> We have to take care of that, so it doesn't leave a scar. The band-aids are... Ah, there they are. I have to disinfect it now, so bear with me for a moment.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I'm sorry. We should be working now, but...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> You don't have to apologize for anything. Everyone makes mistakes once in a while.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I really am sorry. I, I wanted to take the lead like you do, so I started working faster, but now I'm just wasting time...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> I see. Yanase-san, I think it's wonderful the way you're always so considerate of others. There there, good girl.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> S-Setouchi-san... You're rubbing my head...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Ah, I'm sorry, I couldn't help myself. You just looked so cute trying so hard, Yanase-san.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> But, you know... When you're with me, you can let me spoil you a little. After all, I'm everyone's onee-san, you know.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Onee-san...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> That's it, Yanase-san, is there something you want to eat we should put on the menu?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I'll eat anything, so I'm happiest just cooking the others what they want.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> You shouldn't be so selfless. We want you to enjoy the party too, Yanase-san.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Can you keep it a secret between the two of us? There must be something you want to eat, isn't there, Mai-chan?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> (Somehow... When Setouchi-chan says it like that, I feel like letting her spoil me...)<br><strong>Mai:</strong> What I want to eat... Then, maybe hamburg steak or omelette rice. My family always tries to eat healthy, so we mostly eat Japanese dishes, but sometimes I feel like eating those.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> In that case, I'll make a special hamburg steak for you, Mai-chan. Look forward to it.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Thank you so much! Chie-san.  </p><h2 id="5-the-strongest-cosplay" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>5: The Strongest Cosplay?</h2><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> We can't let these aradama ruin a fun Halloween. We have to beat every last one of them!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah. There's a party waiting for us when we get back, so let's give it our all!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> We have to be done... Before the feast gets cold.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Then, to keep everyone motivated, why don't we talk about ways to enjoy Halloween while we head over there?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Sounds good. When you're talking about Halloween, you have to go trick or treating.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Trick or treating... I've heard of it, but what is it?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> It's a big event on Halloween where you put on costumes and go around to all the houses in the neighborhood, telling them if they don't give you candy you'll play a prank on them. So you threaten them like that and they give you candy.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> That sounds like a dangerous event...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> But that danger is a part of what makes it fun; it's the thrill of Halloween. You can be a ghost, or a witch, or a zombie, and you make a really good costume and walk around town with a bunch of other people. It's so much fun.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Then, what about an aradama costume...?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Good idea, Sayaka-chan. I hadn't thought of that.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> If you made it look real, it'd definitely scare a lot of people. That could work.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Alright! Let's hurry up and see the real thing so we can get some ideas.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah. I'm getting fired up!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> The faster I eliminate them, the faster I can eat Mai's cooking.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> This is the place. Huh? I don't see any aradama...?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Looks like they're gone. They disappeared from the spectrum finder too.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> If you're looking for the aradama, we already eliminated them.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> You onee-sans are too slowww~. I cleared them out in a snap~.  
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I'm sorry you came all the way out here, but it's taken care of, so you're free to go.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Okay. Kanami, Mihono... Let's go.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Mm, I'm just glad they were dealt with before anyone got hurt. Though... We didn't get to see the aradama up close, did we...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> That's right. It's a good thing everyone's safe, but I'm sorta disappointed I didn't get a good look at how they move or what they look like.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Oh well, why don't we just try drawing an aradama from memory?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> How will we draw it?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> There's a nice patch of dirt over here, so if we get a stick we can draw on the ground. Let's see, I'll start with the outline... Does that look good?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Hmm, it's more jagged than that, isn't it? And the eyes would be around here, wouldn't they?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> No wayyy, they stick further out, right? As for the legs... How about that?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Good, that's it! ...I think, but, umm...<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Is that an aradama? It doesn't look like one at all...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> We're always fighting them, but now that I try to picture one, I can't get it right.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Onee-san, what're you doing?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Tsubakuro-san! We were trying to remember what an aradama looks like and draw one. But it's tougher than it sounds, making it look good.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Why would you wanna draw an aradama~? You could be drawing something way cuter~.  
<strong>Kanami:</strong> We were going to make Halloween costume. So we were thinking, if we dressed up like an aradama, it'd totally scare everyone.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Eh! A Halloween costume? That sounds like fun!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Sigh...  </p><h2 id="6-the-elite-guards-halloween" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>6: The Elite Guard's Halloween</h2><p>Several hours before Yume and Yomi encountered Kanami and the others, they were--</p><p><strong>Yume:</strong> Why are we stuck at home again~? It's so boring~! Yomi onee-sannn, let's go play outside~.  
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Tsubakuro-san, remaining on alert is an important duty. As members of the elite guard, we could be called upon at any moment, so we must always be ready to act.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Geez~, I know that already. But it's so lame doing nothing but housesitting every single day~!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Even so, we cannot abandon a mission Yukari-sama has given us without permission. Why don't you try thinking of a way to cure your boredom without going outside?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Something fun to do without going outside? If there were something like that, I'd...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Wait! I've got it! Let's have a Halloween party for the elite guards and Yukari-sama!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> A party...? That could be difficult. Shidou-san and Konohana-san are out on assignment every day, and Yukari-sama has very little free time.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Booo~, just when I had a great idea. You do something about it, Yomi onee-san. I wanna have a party~!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Even if you ask me, right now, we're the only two in here. I cannot make that happen on my own.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Mmmm... It's only us two here...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ah-! I came up with a really great idea this time! Since it's only us two here, that means we can set up a Halloween surprise!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Sigh...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> We can dress up like ghosts, and then we'll scare Yukari-sama and the others, and then they'll give us candy! It'll be a lot of fun~!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Like trick or treating... You mean...?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Yeah, that! Since that's what we're doing, let's get our ghost costumes ready!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I didn't say we were doing that... In the first place, how are we meant to find ghost costumes in here?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> We've got all sorts of stuff we can use! Like, what if we take these curtains down and wrap ourselves up in them~!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Look, look, I'm a ghost~! Yomi onee-sannn, I'll put a curse on you~! But only if you don't give me candy-!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Hey, Yomi onee-san! Were you paying attention?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes. I was watching you, but... Tsubakuro-san, do you really plan on using such a simple costume?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I don't mean to disappoint you, but Yukari-sama, Shidou-san, and Konohana-san, who routinely face aradama, won't be scared by something of that level.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Booo~. Then, what should we use?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> If that's what it takes, I could prepare some actual aradama... Fufufu...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Wah, don't do that! When you say it like that, I can't tell if you're joking, Yomi onee-san~!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Fufu, it was a joke. However, as members of the elite guard, we should be prepared to do whatever it takes to achieve our goals.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> But I want to throw a cuter and happier party than that! Geez~! I thought it was a good idea too, but this is so boring~!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Tsubakuro-san, where are you going?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I'm bored, so I'm playing outside!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Sigh...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Yomi onee-san, big news! Big news-!!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> You came back quickly. What happened?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Just now, I heard this from the girls walking outside, but the girls at Minoseki are having a Halloween party, and they're inviting everyone from the other schools!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I see...<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> (Somehow, I don't like the sound of this...)  </p><h2 id="7-i-want-to-go-to-the-party" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>7: I Want to Go to the Party!</h2><p><strong>Yume:</strong> We should go too, Yomi onee-san~! To the Halloween party at Minoseki~!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Tsubakuro-san, the elite guard exist at all times to serve Yukari-sama. If we were to receive orders now...<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Excuse me, my phone is ringing.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes, this is Satsuki Yomi. ...Understood. We will leave at once.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Tsubakuro-san, that "if" has come very soon. Aradama have appeared in the nearby hills. We need to go.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Fufu, those are some unlucky aradama, showing up at a time like this~. I'm feeling ready to cut them to ribbons!<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> GUAAAAAAAAA!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> EIIIIIII!!!!<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> OO OOOooo ooo...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Huhh, was that the last one? They're too weak~.  
<strong>Yomi:</strong> That was an even more impressive display than usual, Tsubakuro-san.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> This is the place. Huh? I don't see any aradama...?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Looks like they're gone. They disappeared from the spectrum finder too.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ...!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> (Those toji are from Minoseki. They might be attending the party Tsubakuro-san mentioned earlier...)<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> (In that case, it would be safest to withdraw before the topic of the Halloween party is brought up... I cannot allow Tsubakuro-san to say she wants to go.)<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I'm sorry you came all the way out here, but it's taken care of, so you're free to go.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Okay. Kanami, Mihono... Let's go.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Tsubakuro-san, we should leave as well. If I remember right, there's still one pudding left for a snack.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Really!? Then we should go home fast. Pudding~, pudding~. Huh? What are those Minoseki onee-sans crowded around? I wonder what they're doing.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Onee-san, what're you doing?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> (Ahh, she made contact...)<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Eh! A Halloween costume? That sounds like fun!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah, we're going to throw a really fun party for sure. Oh yeah! Do you guys from the elite guard want to come too?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Can we!?  
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Thank you for the invitation. However, it may disappoint you, but as members of the elite guard, we need to be ready at any moment in case Yukari-sama gives us an order...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I'll call Yukari-sama and ask!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Hello? Yukari-sama? I can go to a Halloween party, can't I?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> T-Tsubakuro-san...!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Don't worry, Yomi onee-san will be with me. I'll be a good girl, I promise! So can't I~? Yukari-sama, pleaseee!!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Sigh...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Okay, got it~! Bye!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> What'd Yukari-sama say, Yume-chan?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> As long as Yomi onee-san is there watching over me, she said I can go!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Hooray! Satsuki-san, you'll come too, right?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> ......Yomi onee-san, come on, come onnn! I really wanna go to the party!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Satsuki-san, could you just stop by for a little while at least? If a mission comes up, we'll help you deal with it.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Chii-nee and Mai are cooking up a tasty feast too. I'm sure they'd want all of you and Yukari-sama to try it, so please just stop by!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> See, see~! They want us to come too~! So let's go~, Yomi onee-sannn!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ...I understand. With Yukari-sama's approval, I'll take you up on your offer for a little while.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Yes-!  </p><h2 id="8-welcome-to-the-halloween-party" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>8: Welcome to the Halloween Party!</h2><p><strong>Mai:</strong> I don't believe it!

Right now, the organizer of this party, Yanase-san, would like to say a few words.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Hey, Chie-san! Where's this coming from, I can't...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> I know how much you wanted everyone to have a good time, so this is your chance to share those feelings with them, Mai-chan. Don't worry, your onee-san is here with you.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> O... Okay. You're right... I'll try!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> A-All of you, thank you very much for coming to this Halloween party. Please relax and have a good time.<br><strong>Everyone:</strong> We will-!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Whoa, look at all these pumpkin dishes! And they all look so good.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Chew, chew... Y-Yummy! But it was made by Chii-nee and Mai, after all. Itomi-san, here, try a bite of this.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Chew, chew... It's good... Huh? Kanami, Mihono, you aren't wearing your costumes.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Uhh... Well. We tried making them after that, right...? Hahaha.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> They were nowhere near ready, so we gave up on it...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Om nom nom! This pumpkin pudding and this stew are so good~! I wish Yukari-sama and them could have come too~, don't you, Yomi onee-san!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Tsubakuro-san, please remember your manners.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I know, I will~! Hey hey, Onee-san, can we bring this home with us later?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> A jack o' lantern? I don't mind, but what do you want it for?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I'm gonna scare Yukari-sama!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Origami Yukari, getting scared by a pumpkin? I'd pay to see that...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Mind if we pay a visit to the Origami household?<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Ne-!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Sure! Everyone should come~! With enough pumpkin ghosts, Yukari-sama will really be scared~.  
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Wow! Then, I want to see that for sure~.  
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Tsubakuro-san, if you don't behave in a way fitting of the elite guard, Shidou-san will be harshly scolding you later.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Another lecture from Maki onee-san... But I'm sorry, Yomi onee-san! Please keep this a secret!!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Everyone, the pumpkin pie is ready now!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Come get it while it's fresh from the oven.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Whoa, it's huge! And it looks so good! I'll have a slice.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Chew, chew... Mmm, it's delicious!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Chew, chew... Another slice. Chew, chew, chew... Another slice...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Oi, Sayaka! Eat too much and you'll get a stomachache.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Chew, chew... If it's Mai's cooking... I can handle eating any amount.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Thank goodness. Everyone's having a good time.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Fufu. It's because you're such a hard worker, Mai-chan. I'm glad too.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> And there's something I want to show you, Mai-chan. Will you come with me for a minute?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> What is it?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Here, it's a present from me to you.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Hamburg steak, omlette rice, and spaghetti! They're laid out in such a cute way, and they all look delicious. What's all this about? These dishes.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> They're a reward for all your hard work getting things ready. Just a special made party platter for you, Mai-chan. Keep it a secret from the others.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Just for me... Is that okay? I, I haven't done anything for you, Chie-san...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> You don't have to worry about that. After all, I'm everyone's onee-san.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Thank you so much!
