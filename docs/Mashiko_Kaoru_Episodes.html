All of you need to be able to work together.<br><strong>Classmate:</strong> But Mashiko-san helps aradama, doesn't she? That's what my father said! The Mashiko family is all like that.<br><strong>Classmate:</strong> There's no way we can fight alongside someone like her! What if she gets us hurt!<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Ne~...<br><strong>Classmate:</strong> See, she always has that weird aradama with her too. Who knows when it might try attacking us...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Nene would never hurt anybody!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> And I'm the one who doesn't want to work with toji like you! You only think of yourselves!<br><strong>Teacher:</strong> M-Mashiko-san! Where are you going!?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> ......<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Ne...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Forget about them, Nene. They're all wrong. Even though they don't know anything about you, they...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...People like that, they just listen to what they're told and don't think about anything else...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...But I can't stop myself from getting mad about it.<br><strong>Nene:</strong> ! Ne-!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Nn? What's wrong?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...! An aradama!?<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> GRUUUU...!!<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Ne~~~~~!!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...It's almost like two cats having a turf war.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> --But now's not the time to relax. Nene, let's go.<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Ne-!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> See, you're not so tough. Let that be a lesson for you. Don't ever come back around here.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> If you get caught here again, you're gonna get killed for real.<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> ......<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...And it's gone.<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Ne-?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...It was just guarding its home. There's no reason to kill it.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> No matter what people say, that's how the Mashiko- That's how I do things.<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Ne-!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...Ughh.

I'm used to getting dragged in to help out on operator duty by now, but...<br><strong>Kozue:</strong> The one in charge of dealing with this aradama is Mashiko Kaoru-san...<br><strong>Kozue:</strong> "Anyway, I don't feel like it." "I just wanna go home." "I'll pass on this mission."<br><strong>Kozue:</strong> Her reputation for her attitude really precedes her.<br><strong>Kozue:</strong> All other available toji are busy with other missions, so I'll just have to rely on her... I just have to get her feeling motivated.<br><strong>Kozue:</strong> Alright! Time to check on her progress!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Hello.<br><strong>Kozue:</strong> Thank you for your work! So, how's the mission going?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> You too. It's going smoothly so far. I'll stay on alert for the time being.<br><strong>Kozue:</strong> When we received the request for this guarding and patrol mission, I know you just happened to be in the area. So thank you for quickly responding, Mashiko-san.<br><strong>Kozue:</strong> There are plans for another unit to join up with you in just a few days. I'm sorry, but, in the meantime, could you...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Nah, I can handle this myself. There's been lots of reports of sighting the aradama, but it hasn't actually caused any damage yet.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> In fact, having more toji in the area might provoke it. It's probably best to keep this small scale.<br><strong>Kozue:</strong> ...!?<br><strong>Kozue:</strong> I see... You might be right.<br><strong>Kozue:</strong> It's just, with only you stationed there, you could be on assignment for quite some time...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> I'm prepared for that. You don't have to worry about me. I'll just keep up a steady search.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> I'm the one who accepted responsibility for this in the first place, after all. I have to see it through to the end.<br><strong>Kozue:</strong> ...Understood! Good luck in your search!<br><strong>Kozue:</strong> ...She's nothing like I heard... Mashiko-san is such a determined toji!<br><strong>Kozue:</strong> She makes good judgment calls, and has a strong sense of responsibility...<br><strong>Kozue:</strong> She didn't even complain once about being assigned such a basic mission. I have a newfound respect for her~.<br><strong>Kozue:</strong> Alright, I have to do my best assisting her. I can't overlook any bit of information that might help!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Ahh~... What a pain. That's enough for today.<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Ne~!<br><strong>???:</strong> Man, you're so cool, Kaoru-chan! I couldn't feel safer with a toji like you around!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Heh, keeping the town safe's a small price to pay for getting to eat the super famous "Mare Sushi"'s sushi free of charge.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Ah, I'll have some kanpyo rolls, thanks.<br><strong>Sushi Shop's Boss:</strong> You got it! Hey, Kaoru-chan, you should hang out here forever.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> I don't know~. I'm a pretty busy girl~.<br><strong>Sushi Shop's Boss:</strong> Well we can figure something out! We'd do anything for you toji! Here, your kanpyo rolls are ready!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> If you insist~. I guess I'll think about it. (chew chew)...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Mmm~~~! So good. Boss, your sushi's the best. Next up, make it crab, salmon roe, and urchin.<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Nenene~!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Throw in some engawa too.<br><strong>Sushi Shop's Boss:</strong> Coming right up!  </p><h2 id="3-nenes-secret" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>3: Nene's Secret</h2><p><strong>Nene:</strong> Nene-!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Despite there being an aradama right here, the spectrum finder shows no reaction... What a mysterious creature.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Nene isn't dangerous, after all. It's right not to react to him.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Nene's my pet before he's an aradama.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I don't really get it, but if he's safe to be around then I don't mind.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> He doesn't seem scary either, actually, kind of cute... Um, is it okay if I pet him?<br><strong>Nene:</strong> (dodge)<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> H-Huh?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Kiyoka-chan, you have to approach animals gently so they understand you aren't trying to hurt them~. Get close slowly, so they don't get scared, and...<br><strong>Nene:</strong> (dodge)<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> H-Huh? He keeps running off... Is Nene afraid of strangers?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> No, actually, the thing about Nene... He loves big busts most of all~.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ehh!? S-So that means, we...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Th-That's rude! All of a sudden you're not so cute anymore!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Nene can see the future when it comes to chest sizes too. Hate to break it to you.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ughh... So, someone like Chii-nee's more Nene's type...?<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Ne~!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Wha!?

Put your okatana away!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> What for? That's an aradama, you know?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah, but, uhh... Look how cute he is! And see, you're scaring him!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Huh? What are you talking about? Every single aradama-chan's cute!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Get it? Don't go thinking you're some special kind of cute, okay?<br><strong>Nene:</strong> N-Nene~...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Oi. Go ahead and try it. See if you can get through me first.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> The laid back Kaoru-san's... Acting super scary...!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...Heh, it was just a joke. As much as I love aradama-chan, a chihuahua like that's not gonna be any fun.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...But when I haven't seen any in a while, and I start getting bored, who knows.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Nene.

Such a heavy hit! The muscles in my arms and legs are tingling-!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Oi... Why'd you go and block that?

Aren't you scared?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I come out in the mountains at night for missions and training and stuff, so there's no way it'd be scary.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> (When she says it all matter of factly like that, it makes me want to scare her...)<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> (...Alright.)<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Then, since this is a test of courage and all, how about we tell ghost stories while we walk?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ghost stories?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I'm fine with that, but... There's not really any ghost stories I know off the top of my head.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Don't worry about it. I've got the best ghost story to tell.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Huh, you do!?

If you think I'm lying, you can check with Ellen.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> You say that, but...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> (Maybe if I give one more push she'll buy it? What's something good... Oh.)<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> See, look over there. There's a Jizo statue, right?        [Jizo is a deity that is a savior of souls and also a protector of travelers.

Then, this place really is...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Eep!?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> (Though, I'm making all of it up.)<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> There's a lot of paved roads up this mountain, see? Those are trails they made way back to let people pay a visits to the graveyard here.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Th-That makes sense...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> But, y'know, mountains come with a lot of trouble. Like... landslides and stuff.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Th-Then...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Yeah. That's why they decided to move away from this graveyard. There was this really bad landslide... And, apparently, they couldn't even check on all the graves.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...[gulp].<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...Which means, some might've been left buried. Just under your feet right now, there could be a dead body.<br><strong>Mihono/Ellen:</strong> GYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Uwah!? What're you doing here, Ellen!!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I made a mistake! I was planning on scaring you two, but I ended up screaming by accident!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Anyway, Kaoru! Because of you, I can't stay here anymore!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> So, let me go with you!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Guess I have to.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> By the way, Ellen-san.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> What is it?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> When we left, you were there to see us off, weren't you?

We'd be losing a lot of time though.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Ellen-san, Kaoru-san. It's alright. I brought lots of drinks with me.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Chie, thank you so much!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> It's nice somebody came prepared. You really saved us. [gulp gulp]... Phwah. Can't thank you enough.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> It's just a part of me acting as everyone's onee-san.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Have you been an onee-san ever since you were a little girl, Chie?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> When I was little, I spent most of my time together with Mihono-chan, so it's true that back then I wanted to try hard to act as an onee-san.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Though I'm not sure it went too well at first.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Well, there's no way you could've been the same as a kid. But we all depend on you the way you are now.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> That's right; Chie's our reliable onee-san.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> By the way, I've never really asked you about it before, Kaoru, but, what were you like as a little girl?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Ah, I'd like to hear about that too.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Give me a break...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Don't be like that. Do it for meee.<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Nenenene~. Ne~ne.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Nene-chan's asking for it too, see?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Kh... Letting her hold you like that; you're totally on her side now...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> I'll tell you about it, but it's not all that interesting, okay?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I don't believe that for a minute, Kaoru! I have a feeling this'll be very interesting!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Anyway, when I was little, I was a real brat. I used to play with kids around the neighborhood, and I sorta ended up in the position of leading them around.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> That's a little unexpected.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> It just sort of happened after I'd stand up for the ones who got left out or got messed with.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Maybe it's cause I was hooked on the heroes you'd see in tokusatsu shows-.<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Nene!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> You still like tokusatsu heroes now too, don't you, Kaoru-. Did aim towards becoming a toji ever since back then?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> I guess-. I know you know, but the Mashikos are a toji family, so my mom and grandma were both toji too. I respected it because of that, or maybe looked up to it.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Becoming a toji meant you got to defeat aradama, after all.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> What else were you like?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> What else-; when I was a kid, I played with my grandpa a lot too. I always felt at ease being around him.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Since I love my grandpa too, that makes us the same~.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> I'd imagine you always got along with Nene-chan too, right?<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Ne!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> About Nene...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Before we can talk about that, it looks like we've got work to do.

But, there was also a time I didn't want to be a Mashiko toji.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> I'm not proud of it, but that was my rebellious phase.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...I didn't want to work as a toji who killed aradama, so I hated it.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> But, since I was a girl from the Mashiko family... There's no way I could just not be one. It's not like I could go against Grandma and everybody.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...So I got way too fed up with it and started lashing out.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...Seeing me taking my anger out on stuff, Nene came and tried to calm me down...

I completely agree with that viewpoint of yours, Kaoru!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> A world where neither aradama or people hurt each other... I'd like that to be a reality someday.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> And, as a symbol of that, when the time comes, let's make an Aradama Park!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Eh?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Kuku...

You overslept a little, but I'll forgive you this once.<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Nee??<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> You're gonna be the park's main attraction, after all.
