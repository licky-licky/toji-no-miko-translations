## 1: The Hero Club's Udon Trip
**TV Reporter:** Now then, for today's feature... Here! It's Japan's big three udon!  
**Fuu:** Big three udon...!?  
**Fuu:** There's no time to waste!!  
**Fuu:** I want to go eat the big three udon!  
**Fuu:** For that cause, since Konohana-san was busy with work, I had Satsuki-san come in her place!  
**Yomi:** I am Satsuki Yomi, third seat of the elite guard.  
**Yomi:** The instructions I received were to treat the Heroes to udon...  
**Yuuna:** Yes, I have a question! What are the big three udon?  
**Yomi:** There is a wide variety of types of udon.  
**Yomi:** Among those, the especially famous Sanuki udon, Inaniwa udon, and Mizusawa udon are collectively called the big three udon.  
**Itsuki:** What type of udon is it that we usually eat?  
**Yomi:** Since you are all from Shikoku, if I were to guess, it's likely Sanuki udon.  
**Tougou:** Sanuki... That's right, in the past, Kagawa was once known as the Sanuki Province.  
**Yomi:** Sanuki udon is very well known, and popular among people across the country.  
**Fuu:** That's our udon alright! So then, let's start by having some Sanuki udon!  
**Yomi:** I've procured enough udon for all of you from a local shop famous for their Sanuki udon. Here you are.  
**Heroes:** Let's give it a try-!  
**Fuu:** [slurrrp]...!? It's...  
**Karin:** It's good, but... Something's different, isn't it?  
**Sonoko:** I think it doesn't have enough body to it~?  
**Yomi:** I think the udon here is plenty delicious, though it may have lost some flavor compared to what you might find in its place of origin.  
**Tougou:** What that means is, if we want to eat the true big three udon, we'll have to travel to their homelands.  
**Yuuna:** Where does Inaniwa udon and Mizusawa udon come from?  
**Yomi:** Inaniwa udon is from Akita, and Muzusawa udon is from Gunma.  
**Yuuna:** Akita? Gunma?  
**Tougou:** Regions that once existed in Japan. Akita was in the area known as Tohoku, and Gunma was in the area known as Kanto.  
**Yuuna:** Hmmm... I have a feeling we went over that in history class!  
**Yomi:** (In history class...? I had been told what to expect, but they really are strange people after all...)  
**Sonoko:** We can always eat Sanuki udon when we go back home, but I want to eat Inaniwa udon and Mizusawa udon from their hometowns~!  
**Tougou:** You shouldn't be so imposing, Sonocchi. We can't go all the way to Akita and Gunma only to eat some udon.  
**Yomi:** We are working on a strict schedule, but that wouldn't be so unreasonable.  
**Yomi:** If tomorrow would be fine with you, do you want to go?  
**Fuu:** [SLURRRRRP]! Please take us, Satsuki-san! Tomorrow, the Hero Club sets out on their udon journey!  
**Fuu:** Anyway, we'll have to stock up on energy! Let's get seconds!  
**Itsuki:** Onee-chan, that's your third...  
The next day, the Heroes and the toji gathered before the break of dawn.

  
**Yuuna:** Yawn... Morning, everybody! Isn't it fun, us all leaving this early! Kind of like a field trip!  
**Tougou:** Thinking of breakfast, I borrowed a kitchen and made us some botamochi.  
**Tougou:** If anyone wants any, here you are.  
**Sonoko:** I do I do~.  
**Ellen:** Oh! Is it alright for me to have some botamochi too?  
**Ellen:** [chew chew]... Mmm, it's delicious!  
**Tougou:** That golden colored hair, those blue eyes, and... That well pronounced English! Are you perhaps a "westerner"!?  
**Ellen:** My mama is American. I'm Kohagura Ellen, a first year at Osafune Girls' Academy!  
**Ellen:** I wanted to spend some time with you Heroes, so I'm tagging along on the udon tour! Let's have some fun today!  
**Tougou:** An American wants to try udon...?  
**Ellen:** Yes! Udon tastes so good!  
**Tougou:** No one who enjoys udon could be a bad person... We'll welcome you along, Ellen-san.   
**Yuuna:** Udon sure is powerful! It even made Tougou-san fast friends with someone from America!  
**Hiyori:** Is that really something that shocking?  
**Yuuna:** It really is! ...Wait, huh? Umm... Who are you?  
**Hiyori:** Juujou Hiyori.  
**Hiyori:** A friend of mine is from Gunma, but she couldn't come today because of a mission, so I came in her place to show you about Mizusawa udon.  
**Yuuna:** Yay-, thank you! I'm so excited to try Mizusawa udon! Nice to meet you, Hiyori-chan!  
**Hiyori:** Y-Yeah...  
**Hiyori:** (S-Seems like she's the type to act close from the moment you first meet...)  
**Yomi:** Everyone is here, so let's move out. First, in Akita...  
**Hiyori:** Hold on, Satsuki Yomi. The Mizusawa udon place Iwakura-san reccomends closes its doors before noon.  
**Hiyori:** Could we go to Gunma first instead?  
**Yomi:** If that's the case, then I understand.  
**Hiyori:** Good then. Now I should be able to promote Mizusawa udon like Iwakura-san wanted.  
**Yuuna:** If the store closes before noon, then I'm really looking forward to it!  
**Sonoko:** Come on, let's go, Gunma!  
**Hiyori:** From the map she gave me, it should be just ahead... Nn? That's weird; it's closed.  
**Itsuki:** There's a sign up. "As we can't restock, the store is temporarily closed"... Ehh!?  
**Ellen:** You say there's... an aradama infestation at the local spring?  
**Mizusawa Udon Seller:** That's right...  
**Hiyori:** Without being able to get your usual springwater, you can't open shop then, can you...  
**Yuuna:** I won't let them get away with causing trouble for someone selling udon! That's too mean!!  
**Mizusawa Udon Seller:** I'm begging you, please do something about those aradama! If I can just get a hold of that water... I'll treat you to the ultimate Mizusawa udon!  
**Hiyori:** What should we do?  
**Yomi:** The mission I was given was to escort the Heroes on their udon tour.  
**Yomi:** And, as toji, suppressing aradama is our duty.  
**Karin:** There's no reason to think any harder about it then.  
**Yuuna:** That's right! As Heroes, we can't ignore these aradama causing problems for everyone either!  
**Tougou:** We'll defeat the aradama to bring back the Mizusawa udon. And then we can eat it. It's two birds with one stone.  
**Itsuki:** After coming all this way, you can't help but be hungry for Mizusawa udon, can you!  
**Sonoko:** Let's stop the aradama and get back the spring~!  

## 2: Gunma: The Ultimate Mizusawa Udon
**Yuuna:** Alriiight! Let's go stop those aradama! We're going to have that Mizusawa udon for sure-!  
**Heroes:** Yeah-!  
**Ellen:** You Heroes sure do love udon, don't you. Is there some special reason for that?  
**Ellen:** Don't tell me, is udon the source of your hero power!?  
**Fuu:** That's not completely off the mark, in the sense that we grew up eating udon...  
**Fuu:** The source of our hero power... That would be udon and the girl power hidden deep in our hearts!  
**Tougou:** It's Fuu-senpai's pet theory that udon will raise your girl power.  
**Ellen:** Girl power... I see! That must be why you're all so cute!  
**Yuuna:** Hey, Hiyori-chan, what's Mizusawa udon like?  
**Hiyori:** What makes Mizusawa udon distinct is its pale white noodles. They're usually served as chilled zaru udon, but the dipping sauce will depend on where you eat it... Or so I hear.  
**Sonoko:** Pale white noodles, hmm. This udon sounds like a real beauty~.  
**Hiyori:** And also, compared to your average udon noodles, it's supposed to be a little bit thicker.  
**Itsuki:** If the noodles are thick, then it should already have plenty of body to it.  
**Hiyori:** Ah, about that, I was told it's not as if the noodles have more body than Sanuki udon.  
**Karin:** Hiyori, why do you keep saying "supposed to be" or "I was told" and that sort of thing?  
**Hiyori:** I'm only passing on the information from a friend of mine who loves Mizusawa udon.  
**Hiyori:** I don't know much about Mizusawa udon either. So I'm looking forward to it too.  
**Fuu:** If that's how it is, let's beat up those aradama and get some udon ASAP!  
**Yomi:** I've sighted the aradama. Are you prepared for battle?  
**Yuuna:** I'm ready anytime!  
**Yomi:** Then, let's begin.  
**Yomi:** Now, as the spring has been safely recovered, the Mizusawa udon has been prepared.  
**Yomi:** Here you are, everyone. Let's begin eating.  
**Everyone:** Let's eat-!  
**Yuuna:** It's just like Hiyori-chan told us; these noodles are so pretty!  
**Sonoko:** I know~! And this udon is so good it holds up to our udon back home~!  
**Tougou:** The noodles aren't quite as thick as I was expecting, so it's easy to eat.  
**Ellen:** It's delicious!  
**Karin:** This sesame sauce pairs with it pretty well too.  
**Itsuki:** Yes! It tastes very good!  
**Fuu:** [slurrrp]-! These cold noodles go down easy after all the exercise we just did!  
**Fuu:** I'll have another!  
**Fuu:** [slurrrp]-!  
**Fuu:** With the way the taste changes, between this slightly sweet sesame sauce and the soy sauce, I feel like I could eat as many bowls as they put in front of me!  
**Fuu:** I'll have another!  
**Fuu:** [slurrrp]-!  
**Fuu:** Good thing they have this tempura here as a palate cleanser! It helps reset the appetite!  
**Fuu:** I'll have another!  
**Fuu:** I'll have another!  
**Hiyori:** Y-You're going to keep on eating...? Where are the noodles disappearing to?  
**Ellen:** Maybe they're being converted into hero energy?  
**Ellen:** Either way, she has such a healthy appetite! She's a big eating fighter!   
**Fuu:** [slurrrp]-! Another!  
**Itsuki:** I'm sorry about her, Onee-chan is just...  

## 3: Akita: The Supreme Inaniwa Udon
**Yomi:** Next is Inaniwa udon. Our destination is Akita.  
**Fuu:** The taste of Mizusawa udon totally lived up to the name of Japan's big three udon. I can't wait to try Inaniwa udon too!  
**Hiyori:** After that many extra helpings, you can still fit in more... That's really something.  
**Itsuki:** What is Inaniwa udon like?  
**Yomi:** From your perspective, Inaniwa udon will be a thin type of udon.  
**Tougou:** Thin? Do you mean like somen?  
**Yomi:** Yes, it would be fine to think like that. It is a type of udon just thicker than somen.  
**Sonoko:** A thin type of udon... An unknown type of udon just entered the picture~.  
**Yomi:** I've made a reservation at the restaurant.  
**Yomi:** I can assure you the taste will be delicious, so please look forward to it.  
**Yuuna:** So it gets Satsuki-san's seal of approval! How soon before we get to Akita!  
**Karin:** Just hope the place wasn't shut down by aradama again.  
**Tougou:** Fufu, something like that wouldn't happen twice in a row.  
**Yomi:** Hello. We have a reservation, under Satsuki.  
**Inaniwa Udon Restaurant Clerk:** You must be Miss Satsuki then. I apologize, but... Speaking honestly, it seems aradama have appeared along our transport route, and we've been unable to restock...  
**Karin:** Ehhh!? This again!?  
**Fuu:** Geez, this is all your fault, Karin. You had to go and put up that weird flag.  
**Karin:** What do you mean, flag!?  
**Itsuki:** Still... Why are all these udon related places being affected by aradama?  
**Fuu:** The aradama just don't understand the deliciousness of udon... That's why they're making trouble for anyone selling it!  
**Sonoko:** The enemies that come out in our world, the vertex, I've heard they'll completely ignore a bowl of udon too~.  
**Sonoko:** Aradama and vertex; something so inhuman can never understand the greatness of udon~!  
**Yuuna:** If only they could tell how delicious udon is, we might be able to come to terms with each other...  
**Hiyori:** Uh, I don't think udon is going to help us reach a mutual understanding...  
**Fuu:** Anyway, just like in Gunma, all we have to do is stop the aradama, right?  
**Inaniwa Udon Restaurant Clerk:** I-If you would! Once we can restock, then we could prepare for you a supreme Inaniwa udon!  
**Ellen:** Yes! Let's defeat the aradama and have some tasty Inaniwa udon!  
**Heroes:** Yeah-!  
**Fuu:** We've been chasing the aradama for so long the sun's completely set.  
**Itsuki:** We're on a straight trip, so it was bound to happen.  
**Hiyori:** Come to think of it, I haven't seen Satsuki Yomi for a while.  
**Ellen:** Oh, really? Where could she have gone off to?  
**Yomi:** Did she get lost!? That's dangerous; we have to go look for her!  
**Hiyori:** Satsuki Yomi is a member of the elite guard. I don't think we need to worry about her at all...  
**Fuu:** My girl power is calling out to me...  
**Karin:** That's just your stomach growling.  
**Yuuna:** But, aren't you feeling hungry by now?  
**Yomi:** In that case, have some omusubi.  
**Hiyori:** Satsuki Yomi!?  
**Ellen:** Where did you go?  
**Yomi:** I thought you would all be hungry on this lengthy mission, so while suppressing the aradama, I stopped to procure us food. I bought them somewhere I regularly get omusubi from.  
**Sonoko:** These are! Such nice omusubi! The rice is glistening~!  
**Yomi:** I will vouch for their taste.  
**Itsuki:** Ah... This is some tasty rice.  
**Yomi:** Thank you.  
**Karin:** The more you chew it, the sweeter it gets... Mm, the saltiness is good enough on its own.  
**Yomi:** You're very familiar with this, Miyoshi-san.  
**Yomi:** You should have some too, Juujou-san, Kohagura-san.  
**Hiyori:** Thanks... Mm, it is good.  
**Ellen:** I'm back at 100%! Let's beat these aradama quick and reclaim that Inaniwa udon!  
**Yomi:** You did good work today, everyone. Now then... Let's eat.  
**Everyone:** Let's eat-!  
**Yuuna:** Look, Tougou-san! It's completely different from how our udon is!  
**Tougou:** It really is like somen noodles. But, the taste... It tastes properly like udon.  
**Sonoko:** It's different from the udon we're used to, but this is tasty too~!  
**Fuu:** Since the noodles are this thin, no matter how much you eat, it has to be low-calorie for sure. It's very healthy!  
**Itsuki:** I don't think that's right, Onee-chan...  
**Karin:** Each of the big three udon tasted good, didn't they.  
**Yomi:** About that... Sanuki and Inaniwa are considered staples of the big three, but there are actually many candidates for the third position.  
**Fuu:** Eh!?  
**Yuuna:** If there's that many candidates, that means there's that many kinds of tasty udon!? Nnn, I want to try them!  
**Itsuki:** But, after today, we're all full...  
**Fuu:** Okay-, after we get back to Kamakura, we can look up other big three udon candidates and start preparing for our next udon tour!  
**Heroes:** Yeah-!  
**Hiyori:** There's just no limit to your passion for udon, is there...  
**Ellen:** It is the source of their power, after all!
