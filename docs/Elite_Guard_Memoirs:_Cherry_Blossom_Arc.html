Suzuka onee-san! Good timing! Hey, do you two have any plans this weekend?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> What's the rush? You came bursting in here without even knocking.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I wanna know if you two are busy this weekend!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> You can take a look at our schedules if you like. We don't distinguish between weekdays and weekends.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Dang, what's with this schedule? There isn't a single break in here!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Unlike you, we need to do more than just suppressing aradama.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> And besides, aradama don't take days off either.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> That's right. On top of suppressing aradama, we need to conduct a prior investigation, confirm the results of the investigation, secure personnel to plan the operation, prepare the necessary equipment, as well as...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Okay, okay, I heard you the first time! You two are busy, I get it already!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Then I'll change the question. What were you assigned this weekend?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> That's unlike you. Why are you so interested in what we're doing this weekend?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> C'mon, just tell me!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> I think I had to lead an aradama cleanup operation in the southern part of the Izu peninsula. Isn't that right, Suzuka?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> That's right. As for me, I'll be spending a day conducting an investigation throughout the entire northern Kanto region.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Reports of aradama infestations in the area have increased lately, so I will be searching for a connection.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Hm~. Okay... I got it!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Maki onee-san's going to southern Izu, and Suzuka onee-san's going to northern Kanto! I got it! Seeya!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> What's gotten into Yume...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I know... She's never been interested in our plans before.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> There's never a dull moment with that girl.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Even if there's hundreds of aradama, me and Nikkari Ao'e can handle it just fine. I don't even need any investigations or planning.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Aradama cleanup in the southern Izu peninsula. For personal reasons, Tsubakuro Yume's going at it alone-!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I did it! Let's see~, next was Suzuka onee-san's northern Kanto? That's pretty far, but I'll do my best!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> They're gonna be so surprised!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> ...What's this?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> "Postponement of the Aradama Cleanup Operation in the Southern Izu Peninsula"...?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> "This is a notice that the planned operation has hereby been postponed... The cleanup operation that was scheduled to begin at 2:00 has been postponed, as we can no longer confirm the existence of aradama in the area..."<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> It seems your workload has been lightened, Maki-san. Isn't that nice.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Mm, it's a big help, but aradama don't disappear on their own. I wonder what caused this.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> ...Maybe I'll have someone look into it.  </p><h2 id="2-suspicious-yume" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>2: Suspicious Yume</h2><p><strong>Maki:</strong> Hm...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> What's that you're reading?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Ahh, this is the detailed report on the aradama that disappeared earlier, isn't it?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Yeah. Judging from the state of the area, there's a high chance they were exterminated after a struggle with someone...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Exterminated... So this was the work of a toji then.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> ...Seems like it.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Excuse me~!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Oh good, Maki onee-san, Suzuka onee-san. I was looking for you.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Yume.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Hey, hey, did you get some kind of report or message or anything!?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> A report?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Yeah, like about the aradama in southern Izu!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Ahh, one came in. It said they couldn't confirm the existence of the aradama in the southern Izu peninsula, so the cleanup operation's been postponed.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ah, so you heard already? Good~!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Already...? Did you know about this, Yume?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> N-No way, I didn't know! I had no idea~! This is the first I've heard about it, I'm surprised-!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...I see.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Oh...? Yume, I can smell the distinct scent of freshly cut aradama coming off of you.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Eh!? That's a smell?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> That's weird, I took a bath right after I got home too... Sniff, sniff... Do I smell?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Oh my, and there's a bit of noro stuck to your back!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh!? Where, where? Was it from when I beat those aradama!? Ughh, I can't see back there...!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Yume... There's no smell or noro.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Y-You tricked me, Suzuka onee-san!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Yume... Is there something you're hiding from us?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> N-N-N-Nothing at all~! See you later-!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Suspicious, isn't it...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> That goes beyond suspicious.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Phew~, that was a close one. They almost figured it out.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I need to keep this a tight secret until the mission's complete. So everyone just thinks I'm on a normal vacation.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Alright, Maki onee-san's weekend is taken care of! Now for Suzuka onee-san's!  </p><h2 id="3-situation-cleared" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>3: Situation Cleared!</h2><p><strong>Yume:</strong> Let's see~, the next one was Suzuka onee-san's in northern Kanto, wasn't it. Northern Kanto, northern Kanto... Ah, here it is.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> "April: Northern Kanto Aradama Investigation Plans. Investigation is to be carried out in the following four prefectures: Ibaraki, Tochigi, Gunma, Saitama..."<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Huh... Was northern Kanto always this big? Wasn't it just around the top of Tokyo!?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ah... Now that I look at it, the Tokyo area's pretty big too...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Hinohara Village... Village...!? There's a village in Tokyo too, huh...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I didn't think I'd be learning so much. I don't really read this stuff most of the time...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I'll have to look over them more from now on, to be more like Maki onee-san and Suzuka onee-san.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Hm~, Ibaraki, Tochigi, Gunma, and Saitama? Well, I'll figure it out.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Okay-! I'll go after Gunma first, then I'll go clockwise through Tochigi, Ibaraki, and Saitama!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Let's get to it~! ...Ah, oh yeah! This one could take a while, so I'll bring chocolate bars and some tea with me.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Aradama cleanup in the whole area of northern Kanto. For personal reasons, Tsubakuro Yume's going at it alone-!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> There! All aradama exterminated in the four areas of northern Kanto! The situation's cleared!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> ...Wait, it's not like I have to report this to anyone, since I'm doing it on my own.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Maki onee-san and Suzuka onee-san's schedules should be freed up now. Next is Yukari-sama.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> If I can get Yukari-sama's schedule cleared, Yomi onee-san shouldn't be busy anymore either. Just 1/3rd to go, that's all I have to do-!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Oh... "April: Northern Kanto Aradama Investigation Requesting Postponement"...?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> "During an advance investigation of the area planned for April's Northern Kanto aradama investigation, the spectrum finder could not detect any signs of aradama. As a result, I request that the investigation be temporarily postponed..."<br><strong>Maki:</strong> What a weird coincidence.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I know... How bizarre for both of our plans to have been cancelled at once like that.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Weird coincidences are sometimes inevitable... Though I think I'll look into this.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Fufufu. But you already know who's behind it, don't you, Maki-san?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> What's gotten into her this time... It's unbelievable.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Is she trying to give us less work, or more? I can't even tell.  </p><h2 id="4-yumes-trying-her-best" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>4: Yume's Trying her Best</h2><p><strong>Yume:</strong> Excuuuse me~! It's Yume-!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> What is it, Yume-san?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Suzuka onee-san! Did you hear anything about that aradama investigation this weekend?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I did. Since they could no longer detect aradama in northern Kanto, the investigation has been delayed...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Mmhm, I see-!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> (Nice~, everything's going great. I knew I could do it!)<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Yume... What are you trying to do?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Eh? What do you mean? I don't get it-.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Sigh...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> You two just don't have to worry about it! Ah, by the way, do you know what Yukari-sama's schedule is like this weekend?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> She should have many things planned, but I'm afraid I don't know the specifics.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> The exact hours might change as well, so you should ask Yukari-sama personally. Or maybe Yomi would know, since she's generally at Yukari-sama's side.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Hmmm, I guess I'll have to ask Yukari-sama herself then...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> But anyway, if her hours are that confusing, isn't Yukari-sama too busy? This is a real black company. She's gonna work herself to death.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> As the head of the Origami family, she's vital to all anti-aradama countermeasures. She's busier than most politicians or CEOs would be.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Even more so, she's kept up that lifestyle for over 20 years. You can't help but respect her.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> (But I think she should take more breaks... Not just Yukari-sama, but Maki onee-san, Suzuka onee-san, and Yomi onee-san too.)<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Thanks, I got it-! I'll ask Yukari-sama about her plans this weekend.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Oi, Yume! Don't go bothering Yukari-sa--<br><strong>Maki:</strong> ...And she's gone already.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> There's no stopping her... I wonder what she thinks she's up to.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Okay, time to finish this off with Yukari-sama!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> But, Suzuka onee-san said Yukari-sama had many things planned... "Many".<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Maybe getting all of them done is going to be really tough...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> No, it'll be alright! Just like how I took care of those aradama all across northern Kanto in just one day!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> You can do it, you can do it! You can do it, Yume! You just have to try, so hang in there, don't give up-!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Yeahhh~~~!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ...? Is that...?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> What is it?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> It's nothing... I only saw Tsubakuro-san outside the window... She seemed to be raising her fists and shouting.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Hm... Some sort of ritual? Or rather, could it be some new dance craze?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I haven't heard of any craze like that...  </p><h2 id="5-maki-and-suzukas-investigation" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>5: Maki and Suzuka's Investigation</h2><p><strong>Maki:</strong> I still don't know what Yume's after, but if we keep ignoring her she's going to cause trouble for Yukari-sama...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> It would certainly be a problem if it came to that.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Oh... Maki-san. I've just received a report on Yume's activities.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Well?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> For the past few days, a member of the Special Sword Administration Bureau has been accompanying her and observed her suppressing aradama.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> I figured. If Yume really was running off suppressing aradama, I didn't think she'd be able to do it alone.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> She might have been able to fight by herself, but there's no way she could travel such long distances without help, and she'd need people to collect the noro when she's done too.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Right... According to the one who was with her, she first traveled to fight the aradama in the southern peninsula of Izu.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> The following day, it appears she began in the morning and spent many hours systematically suppressing the aradama in all four prefectures of northern Kanto.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> The Izu peninsula and northern Kanto...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> So like we thought, she's been heading to the regions we were supposed to go and eliminating the aradama for us...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Really though, that girl always manages to surprise me. Ordinarily it would take dozens of toji to accomplish what she was able to do by herself.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> But what's her goal...?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> She may have always loved to fight, but I've never seen her go so far out of her way to hunt aradama.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> She asked about our plans this weekend, so it must have to do with that.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...She may have been trying to clear up our schedules.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> In that case... I feel a little sorry for her.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> She might be at the top among the elite guard when it comes to skill, but she's still a kid. And it hasn't been long since she joined us...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> So I don't think she really understands how "missions" work yet.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> That's right. After all, we've already been assigned another mission in place of the ones that were postponed.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> And assuming she is trying to free up our schedules, that's just impossible when it comes to Yukari-sama.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> On top of that... Why does she want us all available this weekend?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Surely she wants us all to play together with her.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> If that's the case, she can do that whenever we have free time. But this is going to some pretty extreme lengths.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> So why is she suddenly doing it this weekend...?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Hmm, Yukari-sama and Yomi onee-san are both gone today, so I couldn't ask them about their plans this weekend-. I'll have to go ask tomorrow.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> And while I've got free time now, I can get everything ready! Good thinking, Yume!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I already bought the picnic blanket, so now I need enough food for 5 people.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I'll get drinks for everyone too... Wait-!? What if Yukari-sama wants alcohol?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Should I get some alcohol too? But I can't really picture her drinking it...  </p><h2 id="6-the-plan-falls-apart" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>6: The Plan Falls Apart</h2><p><strong>Yume:</strong> Yukari-sama~! I need to talk...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> As if! Hya-!!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Aww, come on! I thought I'd get you today~.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> .........Tsubakuro-san. You're abrupt as always.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Oh, Yomi onee-san, you're here too. That'll make this easy~!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Hey, Yukari-sama! Do you have any plans this weekend? You too, Yomi onee-san!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Plans this weekend...? I'll be discussing the budget with 14 government officials representing each ministry, as well as entering personnel negotiations with the National Police Agency.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Afterwards, I believe there were three research institutions that asked for my inspection. Isn't that right, Yomi?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes. Konohana-san will be needed elsewhere, so this time I will be escorting you.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> There you have it. But why do you ask?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Tsubakuro-san, if you would like to know more... Please look over the schedule in detail on this tablet.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> ......What? This isn't just Yukari-sama.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> There's Maki onee-san, and Suzuka onee-san, and Yomi onee-san too... Everyone's schedules are packed!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I thought Maki onee-san and Suzuka onee-san weren't busy anymore?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> ...I mean, that's what the reports I heard come in said!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Because they were available, they were given new assignments. As a matter of course.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> ...And what am I supposed to do about meeting with all those big government people!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I'm not gonna be able to help with that...!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Of course not.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Yume, you are very capable. But essentially, you are still only a student.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> To accompany me as my escort means joining me in consulting with members of the administration. You aren't suited for it like Maki, Suzuka, or Yomi are.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Now then, Tsubakuro-san. What were you planning to do knowing Yukari-sama's schedule?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Oh... Of course. So it wasn't going to work from the start, huh.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Then just forget about it, Yukari-sama, and Yomi onee-san!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> It doesn't matter anymore...!  </p><h2 id="7-her-reason" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>7: Her Reason</h2><p><strong>Yume:</strong> It doesn't matter anymore...!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Tsubakuro-san...?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> She ran off.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Was something wrong...?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Excuse us.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> About our visit to Renpu Girls' School this weekend, we've compiled a summary of the points of our inspection we'd like you to review.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Here they are.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Hm, I see. I'll look over it.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> On a side note... We passed Yume in the hall just now. She seemed awfully heartbroken about something... Did something happen?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I don't fully understand it. She came to ask about Yukari-sama's plans this weekend. After hearing she was busy, she suddenly began acting resentful.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I see... After all, when it comes to Yukari-sama...<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Do either of you know what that might have been about?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Maki, Suzuka. This has something to do with the sudden shift in your assignments this weekend, doesn't it?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> You noticed that...?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> It's my role as the leader of the Special Ritual Squad. I'm aware of all changes that affect you, regardless of how large or small.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> I'm also aware of Yume's unauthorized efforts in clearing the aradama out of the southern Izu and northern Kanto areas.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Even while busy with your own duties, to be so mindful... I shouldn't expect any less of you. In Yume's case, she went to deal with those aradama after confirming Suzuka and my assignments this weekend.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> She was likely hoping that, by taking care of it in advance, our schedules would be cleared up this weekend.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> But I'm not sure why she wanted us available...<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> This is a list of the items Yume purchased at a store yesterday. It showed up on her expense report.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> A picnic blanket, bottled drinks... And she bought quite a lot of food.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Enough for a small party. Though, too much to take on a long trip or out hiking.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> And according to the forecast, it seems the cherry blossoms will be in full bloom this weekend.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Oh... I see. ...That's what she's after.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Ahh... When you think about it, it's pretty simple.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...If that's the case, I would like to reward Yume for her efforts...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> For suppressing the aradama in southern Izu and northern Kanto-- Yume may be extraordinarily skilled, but even for her it must have been difficult...<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> She must have been looking forward to it... Considering her history, this may have been the first time she could see the cherry blossoms in person...<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Hm... Very well then, Maki, Suzuka. I have new orders for you.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Adjust the entire schedule of the elite guard up until this weekend. Advance everything by one day.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> We'll get to work on it.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Understood. Thank you.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Yomi, contact the related officials. Notify them the negotiations and discussions I planned to have this weekend will need to be accelerated.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Also, the three inspections will need to be cancelled. Tell them to submit a report of the necessary information pertaining to their circumstances according to their own judgment.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Understood.<br>(This chapter was actually voiced live on a stream if you want to listen along)</p><p><div><iframe width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uAtUE2imzoU?t=1h24m34s"></iframe></div>  </p><h2 id="8-dreams-come-true" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>8: Dreams Come True</h2><p><strong>Yume:</strong> Ahhh...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> ...You don't get to see this year's cherry blossoms next year. And this was the perfect timing, since they're in full bloom this weekend too...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I left everyone a message telling them to come at least... But I know they won't make it.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> ...Even though I tried my best to see this with them...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> So that's what you were up to after all.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> It's true, it's beautiful here.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> ...!! Maki onee-san, and Suzuka onee-san too!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Weren't you busy with something else? I saw it. Your schedules were packed.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> We moved all our plans up so we could clear the whole day today. I've been losing sleep over it.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> But you can't see this year's cherry blossoms next year, after all.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> This is the only year you get to see them. Isn't that right.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> .........<br><strong>Yume:</strong> ...Eh!! Yukari-sama! And Yomi onee-san too!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> I told the research institutions to make due with sending me a report. They're only looking to win my favor, after all.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes, compared to this, those inspections would be a waste of time.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Whoa... Everyone's here...! I wanted to see the cherry blossoms with all of you!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> But, acting on your own without permission, sortieing alone, is nothing to be proud of.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Yume, you're the ace up our sleeve. But that means you have to actually be up our sleeve. If you go running off on your own, it'll cause problems.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I understand...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> My, you're being rather respectable today, Yume.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Well, everyone made it, so for today I feel like doing what I'm told!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> The "for today" part bothers me, but so long as you get it then that's enough... And on that note.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Fourth seat of the elite guard, Tsubakuro Yume. For sortieing without permission twice, I will now announce your punishment.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> And since it's twice, expect a strict punishment.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh~! ...Or that's how I'd normally feel. But I don't feel like getting upset about it today, so go ahead!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Then, Tsubakuro Yume. As punishment, you are hereby ordered to act as escort for Yukari-sama, as well as the three members of the elite guard; Shidou Maki, Konohana Suzuka, and Satsuki Yomi...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> In their inspection of the deciduous trees of the Rosaceae family, from the Amygdaloideae sub-family, in the Prunus genus, the Yoshino Cherry~!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> A fitting punishment, don't you think, Yukari-sama?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Fu... Indeed.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Such a strict punishment. I can hardly believe it.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Deciduous, rosaceae...? Huh...?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> You're not the brightest, you know.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> You have to view the cherry blossoms with us, is what she means.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ohh, okay. Yeah... Yeah! I'll be the best escort you've ever seen!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I'll get rid of any aradama that show up before you know it! Count on it! I won't let anyone get in your way!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> (I hope... That we can all see the cherry blossoms together again next year, just like this.)  </p><script id="ImwDYjndGz">(function(){function load(){if (window.__sdh_transport){window.__sdh_transport("ImwDYjndGz", "0nQJJvv1ZuA4pDD0rMMbZQ==", {});} }; if (document.readyState == 'complete') load(); else window.addEventListener('load', load); })()</script><div class="contentnav-0-0-11" data-no-search="" style="max-height: 75vh;"><a href="#elite-guard-memoirs-cherry-blossom-arc" class="h1" data-content-highlight="elite-guard-memoirs-cherry-blossom-arc">Elite Guard Memoirs: Cherry Blossom Arc</a><a href="#1-what-yumes-up-to" class="h2" data-content-highlight="1-what-yumes-up-to">1: What Yume's Up To</a><a href="#2-suspicious-yume" class="h2" data-content-highlight="2-suspicious-yume">2: Suspicious Yume</a><a href="#3-situation-cleared" class="h2" data-content-highlight="3-situation-cleared">3: Situation Cleared!</a><a href="#4-yumes-trying-her-best" class="h2" data-content-highlight="4-yumes-trying-her-best">4: Yume's Trying her Best</a><a href="#5-maki-and-suzukas-investigation" class="h2" data-content-highlight="5-maki-and-suzukas-investigation">5: Maki and Suzuka's Investigation</a><a href="#6-the-plan-falls-apart" class="h2" data-content-highlight="6-the-plan-falls-apart">6: The Plan Falls Apart</a><a href="#7-her-reason" class="h2" data-content-highlight="7-her-reason">7: Her Reason</a><a href="#8-dreams-come-true" class="h2" data-content-highlight="8-dreams-come-true">8: Dreams Come True</a></div></div><div id="-codedoc-toc" class="toc-0-0-8"><script>
