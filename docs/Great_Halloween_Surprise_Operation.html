That is correct.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> At the party, Tsubakuro-san had the idea to put a jack o' lantern on her head, and made that a part of our plan to scare Yukari-sama.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> To make that happen, Tsubakuro-san strongly insisted that we go get enough pumpkins for all of us.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Right, that's what I thought. ...So, does somebody want to explain to me what's going on?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> What do you mean, what's going on?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> I mean, why're we just marching off out into the quiet countryside!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Because there's a pumpkin patch out here.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Huh? You're not seriously planning on borrowing pumpkins from some farmer, are you?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> It's scary what goes through a middle schooler's head...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> You don't get it~! You sure are bad at listening. The STT made a request to exterminate the aradama out here!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> There's a pumpkin patch around here that aradama have been ruining, so we need to get rid of them.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Okay. But suppressing aradama won't make them give us pumpkins.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Fu fuu. You really don't get it, Onee-san.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Pumpkins come out of the aradama messing this place up.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Huh? ...The heck is she saying?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I'm telling the truth! They said it's okay if we take pumpkins that come from the aradama!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I've reviewed the same request. Whatever the reason, the aradama here seem to be consuming the field's pumpkins...<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> When the aradama are purified, the pumpkins can be recovered. However, they aren't fit for selling anymore, so we've been asked to discard of them if possible.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Huh... And you want to take those pumpkins and make jack o' lanterns to scare Origami Yukari, right?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> That's what I've been saying this whole time!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...You've really gotta work on your communication skills when it comes to not swinging an okatana around.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Eh~, what's that supposed to mean~?  
<strong>Aradama:</strong> KISHASHASHASHASHA!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Spotted one already! Tou-!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Wh-Whoa... Seriously? The aradama actually dropped a pumpkin.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> See! Just like I told you!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Nn? ...Hold up. There's something kinda wrong about this pumpkin, isn't there?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> What do you mean? Let me see too.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Oh! It looks just like an aradama!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> On top of that, it's faintly glowing. Did the noro cause this?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Well... They're definitely not gonna be selling these.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> But these creepy pumpkins just might do the trick in scaring Yukari-sama!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Probably. I like that it saves us the effort in making anything too.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I know, right! Let's get a whole bunch so we can scare Yukari-sama~!  </p><h2 id="2-great-halloween-surprise-operation-epilogue" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>2: Great Halloween Surprise Operation Epilogue</h2><p><strong>Yume:</strong> The pumpkin's... All sticky... It won't come off... C'mon...!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Yukari-sama won't be able to work in here with it covered in pumpkin guts! We should make sure her office is nice and tidy!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Sigh... Working my body outside of a mission... I feel like my guts are gonna come out too...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Quit complaining and come lend a hand! It's our duty as Team Scare!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Why does it seem like you're having a lot of fun with this.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I never would have thought things could turn out like this either.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Ahhh, my back... So after all that, did we actually scare Origami Yukari?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I can't say for certain. After all, the moment we jumped out from the mountain of aradama pumpkins wearing jack o' lanterns, she used dragonblade<em>. (the name of Yukari's ougi)<br>*</em>Ellen:** She didn't even let us finish shouting "Happy Halloween!"...!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Wasn't it right around the "llo" part that we ended up coated in pumpkin?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I got all the way to "wee"!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> But Yukari-sama didn't even twitch an eyebrow, did she? Awww, I really wanted to see her face all surprised...<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> However, regardless of how it turned out, we still had to do a great deal of apologizing.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> When it comes to Yukari-sama, maybe she shows her surprise by immediately leaping into action.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Maybe you're right. Well, so long as we surprised her, I got what I wanted. I'll gladly take this punishment in that case.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...You know, you didn't have to stay with us till the very end. I feel bad for dragging you along.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> You shouldn't be concerned with me. I was complicit ever since I was unable to stop Tsubakuro-san. And, besides...<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> (Besides, I mabbe was likin it......)<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Besides... What? Nn? Were you just smiling a little?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh-!? Yomi onee-san, did you smile just now!?  
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Yeah.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I did not smile.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Yomi onee-san's smiling is just as crazy rare as Yukari-sama looking surprised!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Seriously?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> It is not.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> It seriously is! Aww, I wish I'd seen it~. Next time, you have to tell me when you're going to smile, okay!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> That's an unreasonable thing to ask of me.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Pfft ahaha! Halloween sure is a lot of fun!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> For sure. Now if only this cleaning would be over...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> That's right. Let's give it one last push!  </p><h2 id="3-halloween-party-prequel" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>3: Halloween Party Prequel</h2><p>One week before the Halloween party took place...</p><p><strong>Yui:</strong> Found you, Kiyoka-chan! What're you two reading that's got you all excited?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Oh hey, it's Yui. Welcome back from your mission! Take a look at this!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> The Halloween party's coming up, and remember how we were all going to get costumes? Well this magazine just happened to be doing a special feature on them!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Ooh~, what have they got?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I was thinking, wouldn't I look cute in this Red Riding Hood outfit!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> ...Nice... That's nice, that's the best, Kiyoka-chan!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> The way you understand your own type just makes me want to squeeze you tight, I mean it!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ahaha...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> There sure are a lot of different kinds of costumes though, aren't there-! This one would look so good on Chii-nee! And Mirja-san could probably wear this nurse outfit...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Mihono-chan, a nurse outfit isn't going far enough. Mirja-san would really make you shiver in a doctor's uniform, wouldn't she?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I guess... You're right? I don't really get what you mean...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Ahh-! Hiyori-san has to wear this black cat costume!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> If I saw Hiyori-san with those cat ears, I'd bury her in a mountain of candy! Ahh~, it's just too much...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You sure have an active imagination...<br><strong>Academy Intercom:</strong> Aradama have been identified in the area of this academy. Toji, make preparations for emergency sortie. I repeat, aradama have been identified--<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Eh!? Right near here!? Kiyoka, Yui! We've gotta go!<br><strong>Kiyoka &amp; Yui:</strong> Right!<br><strong>Child:</strong> Mamaaaa--!!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> There's a kid on the battlefield!? Everyone was supposed to get to shelter!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Wh-What're we supposed to do...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> I'll draw the aradama after me while you two get them to safety! I'm going!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Got it! Be careful!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Ha... With all these after me, they should be able to get away...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Now I just have to... Alright. How bout I clean you up myself?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> <em>Inhale</em>...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> URYAAAAAAAAA!!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Mission complete. Though, I can't forget to call in noro recovery and make a suppression report.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yui-! We got them out of danger! -Wait, did you beat them all yourself!?  
<strong>Yui:</strong> Did I do good-? I've gotta try my best not to get left behind by everyone.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> And thanks for getting that kid out of harm's way, Mihono-chan!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> No way, that was all thanks to you distracting the aradama!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Besides, it's amazing you managed to beat them all like that by yourself!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Pant, pant... Sorry, I couldn't do anything to help again...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> You took care of that kid, didn't you? You helped out plenty, Kiyoka-chan!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> But...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Hmm, then, how about I ask you to do something for me, Kiyoka-chan?<br><strong>Kiyoka &amp; Mihono:</strong> Like what?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> You can wear that Red Riding Hood costume later, but first, you should be a mummy all wrapped up in bandages! And you'll have to take everything off! And I'll help you get changed, of course!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ehhhhhhh----!? I don't want to!!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Don't be like that, okay?
