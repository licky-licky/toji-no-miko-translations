## 1: Eternal Vacation - Prologue 
**Mihono:** Yaaay-! The sea! It's the sea~!!  
**Kaoru:** I seriously never thought I'd be sent to a beach resort instead of on another expedition...  
**Ellen:** It's too bad Hanahana and Yomiyomi couldn't come along, but I'm impressed with the manager's generosity; inviting all the toji who helped with the aradama at the wedding chapel to come here.  
**Kaoru:** Ahh, this feels great... Ah-! Hang on a sec, what if that's a flag...  
**Chie:** Ufufu, you're such a pessimist, Kaoru-san. There's nothing to worry about. We aren't here for a mission; this is a true and honest vacation.  
**Mirja:** As an apology for suspecting Yamashiro Yui, and out of gratitude at suppressing the aradama and returning the wedding rings, the manager made it very clear that would be the case.  
**Kaoru:** Yeah, that's true. Then, let's get this vacation started... Or I'd like to, but we ought to thank Yui first for all this. Where is she anyway?  
**Chie:** As soon as we arrived, Yui-chan went chasing off after some bride, so she could be anywhere.  
**Ellen:** They call this place a sacred spot for resort weddings, after all~. There's a lot of brides around!  
**Mirja:** I see Yamashiro Yui still hasn't learned her lesson. Though, I suppose it was thanks to that side of her that we were rewarded like this...  
**Kaoru:** Hang on? Where did everyone else go?  
**Chie:** They went to the resort's wedding hall, to see a wedding photo of Juujou-san's mother there.  
**Kaoru:** A resort wedding, huh? That's a pretty flashy thing to do for Hiyoyon's mama.  
**Mirja:** No, to be more precise, it doesn't sound as if she actually held her wedding ceremony at the resort.  
**Ellen:** But then why would there be a photo of her here?  
**Mirja:** I'm not sure of the details. Did you hear anything about it, Setouchi Chie?  
**Chie:** I don't know much myself, but the story of when that photo was taken is supposed to be what led to this resort becoming a popular wedding spot. It's amazing, isn't it?  
**Ellen:** I'd love to hear the full story-! I'm going to go check it out. Want to come with me, Kaoru?  
**Kaoru:** No thanks. Even if we aren't on duty, it's the fate of us wage slaves that anything could come up at any time. Gotta enjoy yourself while you can...  
**Kaoru:** Ugh... Right on schedule. And there's no way they're calling about good news.  
**Mirja:** Yes, this is Kitora... I see... Yes, we will move out at once.  
**Chie:** Is it aradama?  
**Mirja:** Yes, within the area of this resort, it seems there is an infestation of aradama. There is a great number of them too. Unfortunately, our vacation will have to be temporarily suspended. Let's gather everyone together.  
**Kaoru:** ...  
**Mihono:** Did aradama really show up?  
**Kanami:** We have to be ready to go on the double!  
**Mirja:** Before we do that, just as a precaution, will everyone please take out their airline tickets. It would be a serious issue if one were to get lost, so we should collect them and leave them in the valuables locker at the hotel.  
**Kiyoka:** Good idea, Mirja-san! It would be awful if anyone lost theirs.  
**Mihono:** Huhh-? No way! I lost my plane ticket!  
**Kanami:** You're so clumsy, Mihono-chan, losing something that important... Wait, hold on! Mine's gone too-!  
**Kaoru:** Ugh, mine too...  
**Mirja:** You should all put more consideration into managing yourselves. I have my ticket secured right here...  
**Kofuki:** Oi, Mirja! Isn't that case for your glasses? Why'd you put it in there?  
**Mirja:** Because it's a valuable item I cannot afford to lose... Oh, it seems my ticket is gone as well.  
**Chie:** If everyone's tickets all vanished at once, I can't imagine it was any ordinary thief that did it, can you?  
**Yui:** What if it's aradama taking things again?  
**Mirja:** That's highly plausible. As we are now, none of us will be able to return home. Let's defeat the aradama and recover our airline tickets.  

## 2: Eternal Vacation - Epilogue
**Mihono:** We suppressed all the aradama and got everyone's airplane tickets back, so now we're free to have our vacation!  
**Mirja:** Why... We should have defeated every one of the aradama, and yet, my airline ticket is the only one still missing...  
**Chie:** Eh? You weren't able to find yours, Mirja-san? Everyone else's were there though...  
**Kiyoka:** Ehh-, then that means, Mirja-san won't be able to come back home?  
**Mirja:** This is a problem. All of the aradama should have been suppressed... Sigh, just what should I do...  
**Mihono:** Oh yeah! I just thought of something. There was a flyer outside the wedding hall that said they were looking for helpers before.  
**Kanami:** If we all pitch in, we might be able to make enough for a ticket back home!  
**Ellen:** Good idea! Let's go check it out now!  
**Mirja:** I can't apologize enough. You should be having your vacation, and yet you're helping me...  
**Mai:** Don't feel bad about it. It wasn't your fault your ticket got lost, after all.  
**Sayaka:** Mm. I'll work hard with everyone.  
**Hiyori:** That wedding hall owes us for what my mom did for them too. I'm sure they'll let us work without any hassle. Let's go see.  
**Everyone:** Yeah!  
**Kaoru:** I finally get to come to a resort, and now I have to work...  
**Ellen:** No point in complaining about it. Come on, let's go!  
**Kaoru:** Sigh... Goodbye, blue skies, goodbye, blue sea...  
**Mirja:** Everyone, please wait. This is a rare opportunity, so you should enjoy your vacation as we planned.  
**Kaoru:** Are you fine with that...?  
**Mirja:** I can stay behind and work here long enough to purchase an airline ticket on my own.  
**Mirja:** You have a responsibility to make the best of your time here, recovering your strength so you can be ready for the next battle. Please, go on, and don't worry about me.  
**Kiyoka:** But, you must have been looking forward to this too, Mirja-san... Looking forward to having fun with everyone... It's a little heartbreaking.  
**Mihono:** Yeah, I know. Saying something like that, trying not to make us feel bad, you're being too nice. I can't take it...  
**Yui:** Mmhmm, and, on top of that, you have that nice hot body. These slender legs that go all the way up... Stare...  
**Kiyoka:** Hey, Yui-chan! Why are you looking up Mirja-san's skirt!?  
**Mirja:** Ya-Yamashiro Yui!? You're molesting me at a time like this!?  
**Yui:** I'm not molesting anybody~! Look what I found, Mirja-san! Here, on the inside of your skirt.  
**Mirja:** The inside of my skirt...? Ah---!!!!  
**Mihono:** No way-! The stolen airline ticket was sewn underneath her skirt all along!!  
**Mirja:** I of all people should have remembered...  
**Kofuki:** Nn? What's going on? Didn't the aradama-chan take it?  
**Mirja:** Everyone, I am incredibly sorry for the trouble I have caused. I completely forgot that I had decided to sew my ticket onto the underside of my skirt, thinking it wouldn't be lost that way.  
**Mihono:** Ehh-!? But, didn't you say yesterday that you put it in your glasses case so it wouldn't get lost?  
**Mirja:** Yes. I did put it there yesterday, but, for security reasons, I routinely changed its location.  
**Mirja:** From under the insole of my shoe, to inside my glasses case. After that, I transferred it to several other places...  
**Mirja:** And I had entirely forgotten I had moved it to the inside of my skirt.  
**Kaoru:** Even for a false alarm that's going a little far, don't you think.  
**Kanami:** It's fine, Kaoru-chan. I'm just glad we found it.  
**Tsugumi:** That's for sure. Still, short of x-ray vision, how did you realize it was there in the first place, Yamashiro-san?  
**Yui:** Welll, I just had a feeling her skirt wasn't swaying around the way it usually does~.  
**Mirja:** I see that perversion of yours has proved itself useful yet again. Regardless, thank you very much for your help here.  
**Kaoru:** Cool, we found the airplane ticket just fine, so before anything screws this up, let's get right to our vacation.  
**Ellen:** I'm all for it! Let's change into our swimsuits straight away!  
**Mirja:** Change into our swimsuits... That would cause trouble for me. I'll have to move the airline ticket to a more secure location first...  
**Kaoru:** Give it a rest already-!
