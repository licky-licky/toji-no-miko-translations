There's already so many stands set up! I can't wait for the festival to start~.  
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Tsubakuro-san. By running around like that, you're obstructing the people constructing stands and transporting goods.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Yomi's right, Yume. We came here with Yukari-sama to lead and the supervise the toji joining in the festival, as part of giving back to the community.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ehhh, but it's boring if that's all we get to do-.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Hey, Yukari-sama~? After the festival gets started, we can go around and check out whatever we want, right-?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> We aren't here to play, Yume. Our mission here is simply to patrol the area.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh~...<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> So long as you remember not to neglect your patrol, I don't mind if you enjoy the festivities.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Okay! Just leave the patrolling to me~. Which stand should I go eat at first~?  
<strong>Yume:</strong> Onee-sans, what do you want to go see?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> There's nothing I want to see in particular.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Can't we just go around seeing whatever you're interested in, Yume?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> But we're all here at a festival? You have to have a good time too! So think about it harder, okay?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ah, that one over there looks good-! I'll be right back!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> She's been caught up in the festival spirit before we even started.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> She said she had gone together with her parents when she was younger.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> ...I see. In that case... I guess there's no helping it then.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Hm? Something's causing a commotion over that way.<br><strong>Festival Prepping Toji:</strong> I-I have a report to make...!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> What is it?<br><strong>Festival Prepping Toji:</strong> Aradama seem to have stolen the paper lanterns we used as decorations! We ourselves spotted several aradama fleeing with lanterns caught on them...!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Aradama are taking the lanterns? What's the meaning of this?<br><strong>Festival Prepping Toji:</strong> I'm not sure, but... The aradama with the lanterns are just marching around the festival area, so it doesn't seem like there's been any serious damage caused yet.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Hm... It's a bizarre case, but we can hardly hold the festival if there are aradama here.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Yukari-sama, with the help of the toji on patrol, we will clear out these aradama and recover the stolen lanterns.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Good then; include investigating these aradama as part of your mission, and see it done.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Yes ma'am!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> We all came to the festival, so I don't want any aradama going and ruining it!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Though, won't it be really annoying getting the lanterns back?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Without the lanterns, the festival's atmosphere will be spoiled. The pleasant mood of the festival is its greatest charm.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Well, if Yomi-onee-san says so, then I'll try not to break the lanterns.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Come on, let's go take care of this fast.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> ...Wait, don't go on your own!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I'll guide the civilians away from here and reunite with you later. Yomi-san, please support the two of them.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Understood. Then, Yukari-sama... I will be going now.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Right, best of luck.  </p><h2 id="2-sharing-the-festival-with-everyone" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>2: Sharing the Festival with Everyone!</h2><p><strong>Yukari:</strong> Excellent work, not only with suppressing the aradama, but also with directing the other toji. With your efforts, the situation was put under control before much harm could be done.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> The paper lanterns were safely recovered as well. It may have been delayed half an hour, but the festival should be ready to open shortly.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> The festival~, the festival~.  
<strong>Yomi:</strong> It seems it's started.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Then, let's go-!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Wait, Yume.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh... But you said I could look around the festival before~.  
<strong>Yukari:</strong> I have here yukata for the four of you. Once you've changed, you may enjoy the festival to the fullest.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Wow! Now it really feels like a festival!! Thanks, Yukari-sama!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> That's right. You should thank Yuzuki... Ayanokouji's president. She's the one who prepared these.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Okay! Anyway, I'm gonna go change!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> We should follow along with her.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> We can't exactly ignore this offer, after all.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> This takoyaki is yummy! Yomi-onee-san, I'll give you a bite too, eat up.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Thank you... Ohm, mm, it's a little hot... Though it is tasty.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I told you~. I think it's even better than the takoyaki I usually have?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Fufu... On top of shaved ice and chocolate bananas, they're offering buttered potatoes as well.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Suzuka. This came up when you were looking at the food stalls around New Year's, but is buttered potato one of your favorites?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> That's right. I don't often get to sample them, so the moment I do see them, I always want to have a taste.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ah, you can scoop for goldfish there! Can I try that?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Fine, go on.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> You better watch, okay~? I'm gonna catch a whole bunch of them!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Geez, why can't I catch a single goldfish~!?  
<strong>Yomi:</strong> If you shout so loudly, you'll alert the goldfish.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> But they keep swimming away as soon as I try! Hey hey, onee-sans, show me how to do it-.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Do your best to show her how it's done, Maki-san, Yomi-san. I will cheer you on.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Hey... That's no fair, Suzuka.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Understood. I will give it a try.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Kh... So Yomi's taking this seriously. Mister, give me a scoop too. If I'm going to do this, I don't want to lose.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ...Then, prepare yourself.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Yomi-onee-san... How'd you get so good at scooping goldfish!? The old guy running the stall looked like he was gonna cry halfway through.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Indeed... That's quite the haul. I was surprised as well.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I may have overdone it. So I made sure to return some of them.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Why... couldn't I catch a single one...?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Everyone has their strengths and weaknesses. You excel at so many other things, Maki-san.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Suzuka...<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> You seemed to want these goldfish, Tsubakuro-san, but are you going to look after them?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Can I!?  
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Though, festival goldfish live very short lives. Will you keep them regardless?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Hmmm. Even if that's true, since you caught them for me, I'll let them live for a really long time!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> It seems the fireworks have begun.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Woww-, they're so pretty-!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yes, they truly are...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> TAMAYA-!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> What's that?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> It's something you're supposed to shout when fireworks are going off, though I'm not really sure why.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Huh, I didn't know!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> TA-MAYA-! This is kinda fun!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I hope we get to see the fireworks together again next year-.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ah! We can all set off fireworks together next time!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Fireworks, huh. It's been a while since I did them myself.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> It wouldn't have quite the same atmosphere as this, but it sounds highly entertaining.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> So long as you take proper caution with the fire, I'll allow it.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> You'll allow it... But you'll be doing it with us, Yukari-sama?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> I will?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> We're making a promise!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Pinky swear, and whoever lies, they get a needle in their eye~!<br><a href="https://youtu.be/jdKVXQRmnJ0">https://youtu.be/jdKVXQRmnJ0</a></p><h2 id="yukata-yomi-start-we-mustnt-get-lost" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Yukata Yomi: Start]: We Mustn't Get Lost</h2><p><strong>Yume:</strong> That yukata really matches you, Yomi-onee-san. It looks good-.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Thank you very much. I'm thankful for President Souraku's good judgment.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> You look very good in yours as well, Tsubakuro-san.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Don't I-? When I saw it, I thought, President Souraku knows her stuff! My yukata's so cute!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Yume.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Eh... Wah!?  
<strong>Maki:</strong> The crowd's thick. If you don't look where you're going, you'll bump into someone.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Actually, what's with this huge line!?  
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Business is booming. What could it be for?<br><strong>Stall Managing Toji:</strong> Ah, the elite guard, with Yukari-sama...! This line is for our yakisoba.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> ...!<br><strong>Stall Managing Toji:</strong> Yakisoba seemed popular at festivals in the past, so we tried copying that, but this was more than I imagined...<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> I see.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> ......<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Yukari-sama... If you'd like some, I could stand in line for you?<br><strong>Stall Managing Toji:</strong> Yukari-sama herself... Wants to try our yakisoba!?  
<strong>Stall Managing Toji:</strong> I-I'll bring you some straight away...!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> ...No, stop. The two of you needn't concern yourselves with me.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> With all these people in line, I shouldn't be the only one to receive special treatment.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Yomi, you have your duty to patrol and observe the area. As for the yakisoba... That's right. If any is left over, I will have some then.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> As you wish.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Don't let it bother you. Now then, we'll look around elsewhere. We have to ensure no one is hurt or in trouble.<br><strong>Stall Managing Toji:</strong> ...Y-Yes ma'am!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Is Yukari-sama okay with that-? With how long that line is, won't they run out quick for sure?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> If Yukari-sama insists, we shouldn't object any further.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh, but she looked like she wanted to have some-.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> We're going, you two. We can't allow Yukari-sama to go on ahead by herself.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> We can't afford to get lost either. Will you take my hand, Tsubakuro-san?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Guess I don't have a choice, huh~. We'd be in a lot of trouble if you got lost, Yomi-onee-san.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes, I'll feel better this way. Let's go join them.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Okay!  </p><h2 id="yukata-yomi-end-someday-in-memory" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Yukata Yomi: End]: Someday, in Memory</h2><p><strong>Yume:</strong> Ah, there's this thing with all these little balls floating in the water! Hey hey, what is this?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I'm not quite sure what all these balls are for...<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> They're for super ball scooping.<br><strong>Yume/Suzuka:</strong> ...Super ball?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Why are they super?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Their repulsive force is super. If you throw them against the wall or floor, they bounce off with great force. And also, the rugby ball shaped ones bounce unpredictably.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> They sound fun! I want some! I can try scooping them, can't I?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Fine by me; go ahead.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I'll get a whole lot, so I'll give you some too, Suzuka-onee-san!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Good. I'll look forward to it.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Allow me to offer some advice before you attempt it. It's a common misconception, but it's actually harder for the scoop to be broken if you let it fully soak in the water.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Wait, really!?  
<strong>Yomi:</strong> If only a part of it is wet, it will break more easily. Also, I suggest not aiming for larger ones and many at once.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Thanks for the tips, Yomi-onee-san.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> You did it, Tsubakuro-san.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Wasn't it way easier than the goldfish though, cause they aren't moving around on their own-?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Wait, where's Suzuka-onee-san and Maki-onee-san?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Over there, eating shaved ice.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> You can't go to a summer festival without trying this.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Strawberry, melon, lemon, blue hawaii... They had so many choices that I couldn't make my mind up.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> You went with blue hawaii, didn't you?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I couldn't imagine how it would taste. I only chose it on your recommendation. It's sweet and rather good.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> The only downside is it turns your tongue blue.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Fufu, and what's wrong with that? I find that sort of thing funny.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> I had a feeling you'd say something like that.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Hey...!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ah! Lucky-. We should get some shaved ice too!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I agree. What flavor would you like, Tsubakuro-san?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Strawberry!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Understood. I'll go buy it, so please wait here for a moment.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I'll just go with you!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> That reminds me, earlier, I saw an Ichigo Daifuku Neko mask in one of the stalls.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Wait, you did!?
