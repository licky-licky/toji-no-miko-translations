It's Yamashiro.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Things are kind of a mess right now, so I'm just leaving you a message.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> ............<br><strong>Yui:</strong> ...Mihono-chan... got put in confinement. They said, we won't get to see her again...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> What should I do, Hana-san...<br><strong>Hana:</strong> What do you mean, Mihono got put in confinement!?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Ah-- Hana-san...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> It's been some time, Suzumoto Hana. You finally came to see us.<br><strong>Hana:</strong> Mirja-senpai... I still don't know... how I'm supposed to face all of you...<br><strong>Hana:</strong> But still...!<br><strong>Hana:</strong> I heard that Mihono got put in confinement... Does it have to do with that great aradama!?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ...Did Yamashiro Yui tell you about that?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> ...I'm sorry. I felt like, I should let Hana-san know...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I don't mean to criticize you for it.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ...It makes this conversation quicker. Asakura Mihono is in a state where there's no telling when the great aradama's power will run rampant.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> You understand the danger of the situation... don't you?<br><strong>Hana:</strong> I do...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> When Asakura Mihono lost control of the great aradama's power, it was decided that she would be put in confinement.<br><strong>Hana:</strong> She lost control!? How's Mihono doing!?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ...She's fine, for now.<br><strong>Hana:</strong> Thank goodness...<br><strong>Hana:</strong> ...? By the way, where's the rest of the investigation team?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Ban Tsugumi is at her research lab.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Shichinosato Kofuki and Musumi Kiyoka... went to the Ministry of Defense. Setouchi Chie joined them, to make sure they didn't do anything unreasonable.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ...Though, as I see it, Setouchi Chie herself is the one most likely to be unreasonable...<br><strong>Hana:</strong> The Ministry of Defense?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Do you remember the facility where Takirihime was held in custody?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Asakura Mihono has been quarantined in that same facility.<br><strong>Hana:</strong> ...Alright. I'm going to the Ministry of Defense too.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> There's no point in going.<br><strong>Hana:</strong> Huh?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ...We're forbidden from meeting with her. The three of them know they can't see her... but I suppose they couldn't wait here.<br><strong>Hana:</strong> But, then... Mihono...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> We can't leave here unattended, so the two of us remained behind...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> ...To be honest, we don't know what to do. I went along with Kiyoka-chan and them at first, but they wouldn't listen to anything we said.<br><strong>Hana:</strong> ......!<br><strong>Hana:</strong> Let's see Mihono.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> If they'd let anybody in, we would... but...<br><strong>Hana:</strong> The investigation team can do it. The team's attached to the Origami family now, isn't it?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Ah!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ......<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I had considered that possibility myself, but...<br><strong>Hana:</strong> It might be mixing up private and official matters pretty badly... but that's not what matters most right now.<br><strong>Hana:</strong> Let's go and see Mihono!  </p><h2 id="2-visit-1" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>2: Visit (1)</h2><p><strong>Mirja:</strong> Thank you very much for hearing out our unreasonable request, Origami Yukari-sama.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> I was concerned for Asakura as well.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Though... This is likely the first and last meeting we'll get. I can't keep making this happen.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> I understand.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> ...Let's go.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Huh? The investigation team's here?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> What're you two doing here?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...It's our assignment.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> We had the two of them stationed here. There aren't many toji who would be able to respond to Asakura when she loses control.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Then, you two get to see Hono-chan...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> ...No, we don't get to visit her either.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> The only time we'd get to see her... is when we have to stop her from rampaging.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> But then... does that mean, you're only here for if you have to cut down Hono-chan...?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...... So, why are you...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...Oh, you came to see Mihono.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Good...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ever since Mihono-chan got locked up here, she probably hasn't gotten to see anybody...<br><strong>Hana:</strong> Is there anything... you want us to tell Mihono for you?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> ...Just tell her, I'm sorry.<br><strong>Hana:</strong> Eh?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Sorry, that I couldn't do anything for her...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ......<br><strong>Chie:</strong> We all... feel the same way... None of us could do anything...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Chie-san...<br><strong>Hana:</strong> I'll make sure... she knows.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...Thanks.  </p><h2 id="3-visit-2" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>3: Visit (2)</h2><p><strong>Chie:</strong> Mihono-chan!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah... Chii-nee... Guys...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Dang, Mihocchi. Haven't you been doing enough crying lately?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> But... they said... I'd never get to see anybody again...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> I know... I know...!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> This is too horrible! She's going to get all messed up, locked up in here by herself!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Is there any hope of improving her conditions, Origami Yukari-sama?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> I could arrange for a better environment... but anything more would be difficult.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> ...Asakura. What have they told you, in regards to your treatment?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> They said, I can't ever leave here again... that it was for the good of the world...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Huh!? Losing Mihono-chan is way worse for the world!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> If we could do something about Kanayamahime... then, could Hono-chan leave here?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> If the great aradama within Asakura could be suppressed or fully sealed... it could happen.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> But... with what we have now, that would be effectively impossible...<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> ...Then there's nothing else we can do. I'm going to pay a visit to Hitakami-san.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Tsugumi-chan!?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Hitakami-san is currently the one with the most information on Kanayamahime.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Yeah... maybe that's a good idea.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Kofuki-san! We don't need help from the kind of people who'd do those experiments! Let's save Hono-chan ourselves!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> The whole reason this happened is cause we can't do that!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That doesn't mean...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Don't fight!<br><strong>Kiyoka/Kofuki:</strong> ...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I don't want to have to see you guys fighting...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I'm fine, with staying here like this, so...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Mihono-chan...? What are you saying...?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> This whole time... I've been thinking by myself. Why all this had to happen.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...But, instead of being swallowed up by Kanayamahime, it'd be better if I just stayed locked up here...<br><strong>Hana:</strong> ...I can't stand seeing you that weak, Mihono.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Hana?<br><strong>Hana:</strong> ...It's been a while.<br><strong>Hana:</strong> I'm sorry... for not being there when you were going through so much.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> It's fine... I'm just glad you came to see me. I really am...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Hana-san's the one who came up with this, Mihono-chan. How, if we asked Yukari-sama, we could get special permission to see you.<br><strong>Hana:</strong> We just used how the investigation team is working for the Origami family. We did have to bend the rules for it.<br><strong>Hana:</strong> But, it was the right thing to do.<br><strong>Hana:</strong> ...Don't try to sacrifice yourself, Mihono. Nobody wants you to do that.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...<br><strong>Hana:</strong> You always looked best when you're saving somebody else... Whenever you're holding up your okatana as a toji.<br><strong>Hana:</strong> Way better than wallowing in self-sacrifice in this place.<br><strong>Hana:</strong> So... don't give up here. If the investigation team didn't have you... I couldn't take it.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Hana...<br><strong>Hana:</strong> All of us are wanting you to come back. Nobody thinks it'd be better if you stayed here, okay?<br><strong>Hanae:</strong> That goes for Kanami-san and Hiyori-san too.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Kanami and Juujou-san?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> They're both right outside.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> And, they're really depressed they couldn't do anything for you.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> I'm sure everybody else feels the same way!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ......<br><strong>Chie:</strong> So please, don't give up now... We want to have more time with you...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I mean... I want that too...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Is it okay... if I still keep hoping for that...? Can I still... keep wanting to be with you...?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> You shouldn't have to ask...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Chii-nee... I want to get out of here... Help me...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> I know... I will...!  </p><h2 id="4-i-want-to-be-with-my-friends-1" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>4: I Want to Be With My Friends (1)</h2><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> ......Sigh, they're all gone again.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> But...

She said she wouldn't give up..<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Mihono-chan...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...!!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Hey! What the hell did you do to Mihocchi!? This came out of nowhere... This is bullshit!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ...Get a hold of yourself, Shichinosato Kofuki. Origami Yukari-sama, could we have an explanation?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> If you want to know the specifics, you should hear it from them. ...Etou, Juujou.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> ...Okay.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Hiyori-chan and I were waiting on alert at the Ministry of Defense, in case Mihono-chan lost control...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Who gives a shit about that!?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Tell us what happened!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> ......<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ......Mihono attacked someone.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> .........Huh? You think this is a joke or what?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Oi, give me a real answer, Kanami!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> ......<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Say something!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> It's the truth!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> When Kanami and I heard Mihono went berserk, we went to see her.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> And when we got there... we saw toji on the floor and Mihono standing over them.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> ...Did Asakura-san really do it? Or did it just look that way?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...Who could have made it look like that?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> ......That's fair.<br><strong>Hana:</strong> ...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ...What condition are the toji she attacked in?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> It seems like it only went as far as them losing utsushi. Thankfully, it wasn't life threatening.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> At that point... was it already Kanayamahime?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> No...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> It was Mihono.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> There's no way Mihono-chan could have wanted to hurt anyone though...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> She was really panicked and afraid...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Seeing her like that...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> ...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> So Mihono-chan attacked them with her okatana?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Hey! She just said Mihocchi didn't want to hurt anybody!!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Stop, Kofuki.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Why should I!? They're the ones treating Mihocchi like she tried to kill somebody!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> It doesn't make sense...<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mai? What do you mean...?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Why would Mihono-chan have her okatana?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> ...Eh?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ...True, you're absolutely right.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> After being placed in confinement, Asakura Mihono should not have had Kashuu Kiyomitsu with her. Isn't that right?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Yes.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Kashuu Kiyomitsu was confiscated while Asakura-san was confined. It's currently in secure custody... or should have been. It seems that someone brought it out.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> ...On top of that, there's one other thing that caught my attention.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Kanamin and Hiyoyon, you two were stationed at the Ministry of Defense in case Mihomiho went berserk, right?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> So then, why did some other toji go up against Mihomiho before you two?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong>　...This whole thing's fishy.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> I don't who, but somebody's going around pulling the strings here.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Mai... did somebody frame Mihono?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> ...I think that's probably it.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> In order to make Kanayamahime awaken...<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> The Hitakami faction is already taking action.

I'll use my Hitotsu no Tachi.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> You can't do that, Hiyori-chan!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Even if it brings Mihono-chan back, there's no point if you're gone!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Still, we don't have any other options.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> No, Etou Kanami is correct here.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> If you were to use Hitotsu no Tachi to suppress Kanayamahime, there's the potential for it to repeat the effects of the Kamakura Special Hazardous Waste Leakage Issue.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> In the current state of things, with the rampant frequency of aradama appearances, using Hitotsu no Tachi poses too much of a risk.<br><strong>Friedman:</strong> Thinking about that won't do us much good now though.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Grandpa!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> What's the old man doing here?<br><strong>Friedman:</strong> I thought I might be some help.<br><strong>Friedman:</strong> Whether or not this could repeat the effects of the Special Hazardous Waste Leakage Issue, there's too little information on just what kind of aradama Kanayamahime is.<br><strong>Friedman:</strong> We could just as easily assume it would do the same thing as with Tagitsuhime, or that it wouldn't.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> So we're in the dark.<br><strong>Friedman:</strong> ...You all have the choice of three paths to commit to. The first: consider Mihono-kun as Kanayamahime and suppress her.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> We're not going to do that!<br><strong>Friedman:</strong> I know. The second: Hiyori-kun will use Hitotsu no Tachi, saving Mihono-kun.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> We're not doing that either.<br><strong>Friedman:</strong> Then, the third option: Mihono-kun is saved, without sacrificing Hiyori-kun.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> There's a way to make that happen...?<br><strong>Friedman:</strong> ...I'm sorry to say, we haven't found a means to doing that.<br><strong>Friedman:</strong> Still, there isn't very much time to mull it over.
