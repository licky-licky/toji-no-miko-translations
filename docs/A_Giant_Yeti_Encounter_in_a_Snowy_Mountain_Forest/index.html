That aradama is escaping; get after it at once!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> I know already! I&#x27;m trying, but... I can&#x27;t get anywhere with my feet getting stuck in this goddamn snow.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Aradama are capable of the same quick movements on both snow and even terrain. I see, this will be useful data.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Ban Tsugumi, record data later! And Asakura Mihono, Setouchi Chie! What&#x27;s the matter? You&#x27;re reacting too slowly!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Sorry, I can&#x27;t move so great, with how cold it is here...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> The same goes for me... You seem fine though, Kitora-san. Why is that?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> With the Scandanavian blood in my veins, cold of this degree is nothing unusual.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Musumi Kiyoka! There&#x27;s an aradama directly ahead of you!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Okay! Gh... Sorry. My hands are too numb for me to get a good grip...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> In that case, Shichinosato Kofuki! ...Doesn&#x27;t seem to be up to the task either.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Fuck! If it weren&#x27;t for all this snow, I&#x27;d get to enjoy myself with all these aradama-chan!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> An empty stomach and lack of calcium must be making you grumpy. I have something sweet for you after we&#x27;re done here, Shichinosato-san.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> I&#x27;m not eating anything until you tell me what you put in it!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Fufu, that&#x27;s a secret though. I&#x27;m sure the rest of you are like me and feel your body temperature and morale quickly dropping. In which case, this is the perfect chance to test these emergency rations...<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Though, I take that back. It seems one of you is doing fine...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Kiyoka-chan, if you&#x27;re cold, then I&#x27;ll warm you right up! Here, hop into my arms!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I&#x27;m cold, but... I&#x27;ll take care of myself...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ehh, don&#x27;t be shy! Come on! Kiyoka-chan!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> At any rate, it seems the only ones among us able to move normally are myself and Yamashiro Yui. Yamashiro Yui, we&#x27;ll have to manage this together.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Okaaay! Ah, I&#x27;ll try super hard on this mission, so when we&#x27;re done, can we all stop by the hot spring!?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> If I were to hypothetically agree to that, how much would &quot;super hard&quot; be?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I&#x27;ll go at it 5 times harder than I usually do!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> ...In that case, I&#x27;ll consider it.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Hooray-! If I get to see everyone bathing in the open under the snow, I&#x27;ll try super duper hard!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> DORYAAAAAAAAAA!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> All those aradama, taken out in seconds by one person... If only I could research some mechanism to reliably convert those dark thoughts to fighting energy.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Our mission is complete. Then, before you&#x27;re all frozen in place, let&#x27;s head down the mountain. Please follow after me.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ughhh, the snow turned into a blizzard.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> I can&#x27;t see in front of us thanks to it... Mihono-chan, Kiyoka-chan, take my hands so we don&#x27;t lose each other.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Thank you. But what should we do? We&#x27;re stuck here with all this snow...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Please remain calm. I will guide you all out of here, so do your best not to fall behind.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Shichinosato-san, are you feeling okay? Mirja-san has already moved quite far ahead.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> She&#x27;ll be fine on her own. I could do that too, if it weren&#x27;t snowing... Shit...<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> You&#x27;re awfully cranky today... At times like this, what would be best to cheer you up...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Kofuki-san, the cold is annoying you, right? Then don&#x27;t worry; at the bottom of the mountain is a hot spring we can get all heated up in together!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> I don&#x27;t wanna!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ehh, why not? A hot spring&#x27;ll get your heart and body feeling all warm and fluffy! It&#x27;ll pull you out of that bad mood in a second~.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> You&#x27;re wrong, Yamashiro-san. What Shichinosato-san is sulking about is that she didn&#x27;t get to play enough.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> &quot;Didn&#x27;t get to play enough&quot;, what am I, a little kid!?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> AH-!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> What is it, Mihono-chan?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> J-Just now...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> That was you shouting, wasn&#x27;t it, Asakura Mihono? What happened?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Just now, I saw a yeti over there in the woods!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="2-form-up-yeti-investigation-team"></a>2: Form Up! Yeti Investigation Team<a class="hash-link" href="#2-form-up-yeti-investigation-team" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> A yeti...? Over there in the woods you said, Asakura-san...<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> As if there&#x27;s something like that out here! You suck at making jokes, Mihocchi.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I have to agree. Creatures like yeti don&#x27;t actually exist.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> But I know I saw it for sure!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> If it really is out there, that&#x27;s scary... What if it tries to eat us...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Don&#x27;t be afraid, Kiyoka-chan. If something like that happens, I&#x27;ll protect you. And you never know, it could be a friendly yeti who&#x27;s come to help us.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> A friendly yeti? I hope it&#x27;s a yuki onna instead then. They&#x27;re meant to be hot.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> It must have been a fair distance away, so I doubt she was able to tell its sex. The weather has improved, so why don&#x27;t we go looking for this yeti?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Count me out. I&#x27;m not walking around through all this snow looking for something that&#x27;s not even an aradama-chan.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Shichinosato-san, we have to capture this yeti. If it turns out to be some new kind of aradama that doesn&#x27;t register on our spectrum finders... That could be a very useful sample.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> A new kind of aradama-chan!? You shouldn&#x27;t said that sooner! We&#x27;ve got plenty of time before the train back comes, right? Let&#x27;s go hunting!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Suddenly Kofuki-san&#x27;s more excited than anyone...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> It&#x27;s true that&#x27;s a possibility. The blizzard has ended and it&#x27;s become warmer, so why don&#x27;t we search the area?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I&#x27;m all for it!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Come on, come on, outta the way-! I&#x27;m gonna be the first one to meet this new aradama-chan! You guys just try to keep up!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> She&#x27;s very determined, that Shichinosato Kofuki. Now then, Asakura Mihono? Can you name any identifying features of the yeti you saw?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Umm... It was really big, like I think it was over two meters tall. And it had all this messy white fur...<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Two meters tall... By the way, this messy fur it had, could you be more specific about it?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Uhh... I know its head was all covered in fur, like PSHAAA, waving around all over...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Oh yeah, oh yeah! Its eyes were seriously glowing too! It was like someone glaring, but way too intense for a person! It was so scary...<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> (...I see, so that&#x27;s what happened. Well, I won&#x27;t spoil their fun.)<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> (Besides, if worst comes to worst, I have these emergency rations. We should be able to avoid disaster...)<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> The yeti... In some countries, it&#x27;s also known as &quot;bigfoot&quot;. It&#x27;s defined as... Living deep in the mountains, far from human civilization, its body covered in thick fur, bipedal and stands upright...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> It&#x27;s true that this unidentified animal you saw matches the definition on several points.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Was it really over this way, Mihocchi?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah. I saw it deep in the woods, so it should be over there.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Is it me, or is the sky getting darker?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> It is. They say the weather up on mountains is fickle, but... Oh no, the snow&#x27;s coming down again.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> We&#x27;ve been walking pretty far. Will we be able to find our way back?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I&#x27;ve got that covered! I left pebbles marking the way we came so we couldn&#x27;t get lost, see... Wait, huh?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Now we can&#x27;t see them due to the blizzard.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> This is a problem. Now we have no way of knowing the way back, do we?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Then, does that mean...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> We&#x27;re stranded up here!?  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="3-stranded"></a>3: Stranded?<a class="hash-link" href="#3-stranded" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> The blizzard&#x27;s grown even stronger than before, hasn&#x27;t it? At this rate we might actually be stranded up here.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> What&#x27;s going to happen to us...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> This is my fault. It&#x27;s all because I said something I shouldn&#x27;t have.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> No point in crying about it. Besides, I was the one who wanted to go hunting for that aradama-chan.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I&#x27;m also to blame. I shouldn&#x27;t have provoked Shichinosato-san. I&#x27;m sorry...<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Kitora-san, how do they resolve situations like this when they happen in Scandinavia?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve never experienced being stranded in Scandanavia, so I have no practical knowledge that would help...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> But it would be a good idea to move as little as necessary during the blizzard to preserve your stamina. I will search for a safe route out, so the rest of you should remain waiting here without wandering.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> She&#x27;s gone. Will Mirja-san be okay by herself...?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> We should just do as she told us and wait here.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Sorry... I&#x27;m feeling really hungry from all the exercise before.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> That reminds me. I made emergency rations just in case something like this happened. Would you all like some?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Eh... You made them, Tsugumi-san...?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Which means...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Tsugumi-san&#x27;s home cooking!? Nothing would make me happier up on this mountain than eating a girl&#x27;s home cooking~! Don&#x27;t mind if I do~! Chew chew...<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Oi, oi, do you have any idea what she put in those things!? Is it safe for her to dig in like that!?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> BWHA... Wh-What is this? I&#x27;ve never tasted anything like it? What&#x27;s in it, anyway!?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> A balanced assortment of meat and fish proteins, blended with various fruits, vegetables, and supplements, all processed for long term storage.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> As its purpose was to aid in survival in snowy mountain conditions, I paid no attention to the taste. Is there a problem with it?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I mean, it does taste like it&#x27;d be pretty nutritious, but my mouth is still all tingling and numb and mushy...<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> What kinda flavor is that! No matter what, there&#x27;s nooo way I&#x27;m eating that crappy food of yours!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Is the taste that bad? Chew chew... I think this is an acceptable level for food though...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Huh? I started feeling all funny. Like I&#x27;m getting all warmed up and energized!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Really!?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Yeah! I&#x27;m feeling way more lively now, like I&#x27;m bursting with strength-!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Could those rations actually be effective?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> In that case, it might better if we tried to ignore the taste and ate them anyway.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> No way! I&#x27;m not eating those... Achoo! Brrr. Dammit, is there anything we can do about this cold already?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> If that&#x27;s all you want, then I&#x27;ll warm you right up with my burning hot body, Kofuki-san!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Quit grabbing at me.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ehh, but you let Tsugumi-san get close, so what&#x27;s the difference?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Shichinosato-san is fundamentally a catlike person. If you chase her she&#x27;ll hiss at you, which is why it&#x27;s best to wait for her to come to you.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Really! That&#x27;s useful information! But I&#x27;m no good at waiting, you know~.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Aghh, that&#x27;s it~! I can&#x27;t take any more of this doing nothing waiting around for the blizzard to stop! Everyone, the time has come to use our last resort!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> A last resort in enduring the blizzard?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> That&#x27;s right, we&#x27;ll all get naked and hug each other for warmth!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I see, through direct physical contact and keeping the amount of skin exposed to open air at a minimum, such a method would allow us to preserve our body temperature.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> It&#x27;s a common technique brought up in romantic movies and the like...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> If we went along with that, there wouldn&#x27;t be any romance to it though...<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> You&#x27;re supposed to do that in a shack or something, not out in the middle of the mountain!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> The circumstances are so great that we can&#x27;t even find one of those! We have to do this, to save all your lives... Pant pant... Come on! I&#x27;ll start with Tsugumi-san-!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Wh-Why are you starting with me!?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> As the new member, don&#x27;t you think this is the fastest way to deepen our friendship?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> There&#x27;s no time to waste; please take your clothes off! Or are you the type who likes having them taken off? Pant pant pant...  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="4-yeti-discovery"></a>4: Yeti Discovery<a class="hash-link" href="#4-yeti-discovery" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Yui:</strong> Come on, Tsugumi-san! If you won&#x27;t take those clothes off, I&#x27;ll get them off for you~!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Th-That&#x27;s going a little too far...!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> AHH-! Yeti-!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> For real!? Where?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> There! Look, over behind that tree!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> It&#x27;s hard to see through the blizzard... But I saw something white moving around just now!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I think I see glowing eyes too... Eh... What should we do? It keeps coming closer to us...<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Ohhh, so it finally showed up! The new aradama-chan!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I won&#x27;t let it get away with interrupting my lovey dovey time with Tsugumi-san-!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Wah, while we were talking, it keeps getting closer...!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Somebody, help us-!<br>
<strong>Mihono/Kiyoka/Chie:</strong> KYAAA-!!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> (As I thought, &quot;fear makes fools of us all&quot;.)<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Did something happen? You were making an awful lot of noise. I found a way back down, so I came to show you all...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Say, Mihono-chan, was the yeti you saw...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I-I&#x27;m sorry... I mean, she&#x27;s white all over...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ehh? What do you mean? What happened to the yeti?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Hono-chan was seeing things... And thought Mirja-san was a yeti.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Asakura Mihono! Which means, the first sighting as well...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Sorry, I think it was because you were walking out ahead of us...<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Oi oi, Mihocchi! There&#x27;s a limit to crying wolf, you know!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Kitora-san did look like the real thing, though.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Oi, you... Don&#x27;t tell me you knew from the start?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I thought I&#x27;d be able to collect a fair amount of practical data by letting the misunderstanding go on.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> This is the problem with you...<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I came up with some good ideas for improving my emergency rations, so assist me in a few trials once we get back to the lab, okay?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Sigh... A two meter tall giant covered in shaggy hair...?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> So that&#x27;s how I appear in Asakura Mihono&#x27;s eyes...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I&#x27;m really sorry, Mirja-san! I&#x27;ve never thought that about you normally...!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> That innocent concern of yours doesn&#x27;t make this any better. A two meter tall hairy giant...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> A-Anyway, now that we know the way down the mountain, we should get going while the weather&#x27;s cleared up.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> That&#x27;s right! And when we get down the mountain, hot spring~ hot spring~.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I learned when I was searching for our route that this area of the mountain is actually directly behind a ski resort. It seems to be a popular location for snowboarding.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Snowboarding! That sounds fun.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> In that case, why don&#x27;t we try some snowboarding before heading home! Allow me to observe just how much stamina you all have left after being stranded in a blizzard.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Huh!? Why should we wear ourselves out for you!?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> This is valuable data!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...Sigh. Well, since it sounds like I don&#x27;t get a say in it, I&#x27;ll tag along.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Awesome-! Let&#x27;s all go snowboarding before we leave!<br>
<strong>Chie/Kiyoka:</strong> Lets!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Uuu, but the hot spring...  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="5-the-origami-family-joins-in"></a>5: The Origami Family Joins In<a class="hash-link" href="#5-the-origami-family-joins-in" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Everyone, the entrance is this way. There really was a ski resort up here after all.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Snowboarding&#x27;s whatever, but I guess I&#x27;ll give it a shot before we head back.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> You say that, but you&#x27;re a little excited for this, aren&#x27;t you.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Wha... As if!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> You all seem to have carried out your mission successfully. Good work.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Huh!? What&#x27;s Maki-senpai doing here?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Good to see you too... After reviewing your combat data, Yukari-sama decided to institute training for toji on further missions in snowy conditions.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> And so, bringing some available toji up here, we rented this ski resort as a space for snowy combat training exercises.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Thaaaat&#x27;s how it is! It&#x27;s training where a whole bunch of toji go around fighting each other in the snow~!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> So ready or not, here I come~!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Oi oi oi oi!!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Hey, hold it, Yume. These girls just got back from a mission, so they must be exhausted, aren&#x27;t they?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Yeah, we&#x27;re totally beat. We want to get out of here already, so you mind if we skip this?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> But we were all going to go snowboarding before we left.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Oi-! Just shut up about that!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Oh, so you still had the energy to fool around. Then I&#x27;ll have to ask you to join this training. You can share with the others what you learned fighting in the snow.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I like it, I like it! With you onee-sans around, this&#x27;ll get more fun~. Let&#x27;s fight already!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> You know... Would it kill you to read the mood a little...?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Now now, Shichinosato-san, there&#x27;s nothing to worry about. I thought something like this might happen and prepared these.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Huh? What&#x27;s that? I already don&#x27;t like where this is going.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Fufu. These are my prized &quot;special emergency rations&quot;, for warming your frozen body and restoring your energy before you know it.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Those&#x27;re gonna taste like garbage again, aren&#x27;t they!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> But I guess they do work pretty good... Dammit, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve got a choice this time...<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> About these &quot;special emergency rations&quot;, I&#x27;ll only offer them to anyone who beats me in a fight. If you want one, then go right ahead and challenge me.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Oi, quit screwing around. Just hand &#x27;em out!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> But I want more data on all of you fighting in the snow.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I have plenty to offer to anyone willing to help me out.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Whatever! I get it, so... I&#x27;ll play along.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> You seem more willing now, at least.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I should mention that Yukari-sama herself will also be overseeing this training. If you end up facing off against her, do your best not to disappoint.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> With that out of the way, let&#x27;s start the practice battles.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations/edit/docs/A_Giant_Yeti_Encounter_in_a_Snowy_Mountain_Forest.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_2_ui" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_3DPF"></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"></div></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_35-E thin-scrollbar"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#1-the-smell-of-trouble-on-a-snowy-mountain-mission" class="table-of-contents__link">1: The Smell of Trouble on a Snowy Mountain Mission...</a></li><li><a href="#2-form-up-yeti-investigation-team" class="table-of-contents__link">2: Form Up!
