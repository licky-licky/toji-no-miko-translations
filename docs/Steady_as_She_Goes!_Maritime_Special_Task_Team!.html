This is where the JMSDF ships are.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Sorry, you three. Did we keep you waiting?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah, Setouchi-san! And Shichinosato-san too!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> I heard we were getting backup, but I didn't think it was you, Sayaka. And Kanami and Kaoru too. Just so we're clear, don't get between me and my prey.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Yeah, actually, take as much as you want. Here's hoping I won't have to lift a finger.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Thank you for helping us on this mission. I know the Special Task Team has been shorthanded lately.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> You don't have to thank us! Defeating aradama is a toji's job, after all!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> It looks like there's another person here...<br><strong>Matsunaga Yurina:</strong> ...First year in high school at the Heijou Institute, Matsunaga Yurina. ...I'll be joining you on this mission.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> So they got 6 of us ready this time.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> No, there's more. The lacquerer from the mountings department, Terashimo-san, and Hashi-san, who's taking preparatory courses in engineering, are coming too. They should already be on the ship.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> If it's okay with everyone, we should get on board. The trip shouldn't be long.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Okay!<br><strong>Yurina:</strong> ......<br><strong>Terashimo Hoozuki:</strong> Ah, over here. We were waiting for you.<br><strong>Hashi Keiko:</strong> Um, nice to meet you...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Yes, it's nice to meet you two.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Terashimo-san. I hate to ask this right off the bat, but could you explain the details of today's mission? We haven't heard anything yet.<br><strong>Hoozuki:</strong> Sure, straight away. Our mission is to go around to lots of islands and get rid of the aradama there.<br><strong>Hoozuki:</strong> But it sounds like we also have to find the points where all these aradama came from.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> This mission sounds like it could drag on for a while...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Kuku... All those aradama-chan crowding about. Sounds like a good time waiting to happen.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> You're feeling motivated, aren't you, Shichinosato-san!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> You know it!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Kofuki likes fighting aradama.<br><strong>Yurina:</strong> .........<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Hm? What's wrong, Matsunaga-san? Is there something stuck to my face?<br><strong>Yurina:</strong> ...No, it's nothing.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> (Matsunaga-san... If I remember, she has extremely quick and beautiful swordsmanship. I can't wait to see her fighting up close.)<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Now then, that's the details of our mission. We should be leaving port soon.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> I've been appointed as leader here, so let's all get along.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Okay! I'll follow you, leader!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...It's been a while now since we set sail... Ugh... I'm not good with staying cramped like this for so long. My Nenekirimaru needs room to breathe.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> That's just because your okatana is so big. The blade of my Chidori is short, so I'm totally fine in here.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Small swords must be handy at times like this.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> You have a small body, Kaoru, so you shouldn't have a problem.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> What was that?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Everyone, we're about to arrive at the first island, so get ready to disembark. According to the investigation by STT members who got here before us, the aradama should have originated from the mountains on the island.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> There's mountains out here in the middle of the ocean? Well, I don't really care so long as there's aradama to hunt there!  </p><h2 id="2-troubles-brewing" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>2: Trouble's Brewing!</h2><p><strong>Chie:</strong> ...Mm, that should do it. Thank you, Itomi-san. I wouldn't have been able to put together this progress report before we left for the next island if it wasn't for your help.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> All I did was talk to all the people on the island. Chie, does this mean today's mission is going well?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> I think we're making good progress. Nothing worth mentioning has gone wrong so far...<br><strong>Hoozuki:</strong> S-S-Setouchi-san, we need help! Etou-san fell in the ocean!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Eh-!?  
<strong>Hoozuki:</strong> Mashiko-san's okatana wasn't long enough to reach down to the water from the deck either...<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Even for Kaoru's Nenekirimaru, that's too far...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> There should be a lifesaver on the deck! Use that!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Hoozuki-san, go tell the JMSDF personnel not to start the ship!<br><strong>Hoozuki:</strong> Yes ma'am, I'll go as fast as I can!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Man, what the hell were they doing?<br><strong>JMSDF Official:</strong> Is it alright if we get the ship moving now?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Yes. I'm very sorry we cost your time like this.<br><strong>JMSDF Official:</strong> Don't worry, all that matters is that Etou-san safely got back on board.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Achoo! Uuu, the air conditioning is making it feel even colder...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> I'm just glad that's the worst that came of it. If you'd fallen off after we'd departed, you could have gotten caught up in the propellers.<br><strong>Yurina:</strong> ...Sorry. It was my fault...<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> What do you mean...?<br><strong>Yurina:</strong> ...At the tournament, I saw Etou-san's swordfighting. She fought so well... So I wanted a to challenge her to a bout myself...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> And while they were fighting, Kanami lost her balance and splashed right in the water.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> It's my fault too, for accepting your challenge. And I'm the one who fell in...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> So that's what happened... At any rate, you're not allowed to fight each other up on the deck anymore. You caused trouble for the JSMDF officials, and we're meant to be on a mission right now.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Got it! I'm sorry.<br><strong>Yurina:</strong> ...Understood.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...Kanami, why did you fall in the water?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Huh?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Normally you would never lose your balance in the middle of a fight.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Oh... Well, actually... Ever since this mission started, I've been feeling a little off.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> You know how the ship's always swaying, right? I think it's throwing off my senses...<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> When you were fighting, the ship was still in port... You could still feel it swaying?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah. Even in port, I could still feel it a little, the effect of the waves on the ship.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> I can't feel it at all...<br><strong>Yurina:</strong> ...I don't feel it either.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Etou-san must have sharper senses than most people... That's why she's affected by it.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Kanami's got the senses of a wild beast, after all.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> A wild beast... You could have phrased that a little nicer.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Mmm... But, I hate that I couldn't fight at full strength while we were up on the deck. I might have to fight aradama at some point in a place that's swaying like that.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> You're taking it too seriously. Like you're ever going to end up fighting in such specific circumstances.<br><strong>Hoozuki:</strong> Ah, Kanami-san, your okatana is still dripping wet. Do you mind if I look after it? If we don't give it some maintenance soon, the guard and handle could be damaged.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Whoa, you're right. Then, can I leave it to you?<br><strong>Hoozuki:</strong> Sure, it won't take long.<br><strong>Hoozuki:</strong> There, Chidori's all taken care of.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> That's amazing! It's even easier to get a grip on than before! Thanks!<br><strong>Hoozuki:</strong> It's nothing, I was glad to help. I'm here on this mission in case something like this happened, after all.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I feel a lot better having a specialist like you around!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> ...Ah, that's it. Just like how I had you look at my okatana, I need an expert on fighting in unstable conditions... I just need a specialist with a lot of experience to give me some tips!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> A specialist...?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Everyone, we're about to arrive at the next island, so please get ready. According to reports, aradama have been appearing in caves in the mountains there.  </p><h2 id="3-sayakas-request" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>3: Sayaka's Request</h2><p><strong>Kaoru:</strong> There's just no end to this mission, is there. Though, when we're sailing around like this there's not much to do, so we get a bit of a break. And the curry they make is super good.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah, the curry's good, isn't it...<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Kanami, you sound sad. Is something wrong?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> That's because... I went to talk to Shichinosato-san earlier, to see if she'd teach me how to fight better without losing your footing. But she told me she's not the right person to be teaching anybody...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Shichinosato-san has a lot of experience in actual combat, and she's so light on her feet even though she's dual wielding, so she must have a great sense of balance. So I thought I'd ask her to teach me the hang of it...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Ahh, so Kofuki's the specialist you went for?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> You want to learn from Kofuki, Kanami?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah... But, it's no use. Aww, I thought it was a good idea too...<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...Okay, I understand. I'll ask her.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Eh? You will?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Kofuki and I go to Renpu Girls' Academy together, so we aren't strangers.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Kofuki, are you busy?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Huh? Oh, it's you, Sayaka. ...And what, you're back again, Kanami?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Sorry to bother you. But I really want to learn from you, Shichinosato-san.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Didn't I tell you last time? I'm no good at that teaching stuff.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Kofuki, will you say no even if I say please?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> What?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I want you to teach Kanami... Please.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Ugh, don't lower your head like that. If President Takatsu finds out you're doing this, she's gonna make a big stink about it later.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Kanami's in trouble right now. So... Kofuki, please.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...Seriously...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Tch... Okay, I get it already. You're really not giving me a choice here.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Eh, so you'll teach me...!?  
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Don't get the wrong idea. I can't teach anybody.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> So when we're on the next island, just stay close to me while I'm fighting. If you can pick up anything from the way I fight, go right ahead.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Shichinosato-san... Thanks! That's enough for me!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Ah, there you are. Etou-san, Itomi-san, Kofuki-chan. We're about to arrive at the next island. It seems like we could be fighting right away, so please get ready.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Alright, let's go, Kanami.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Okay! I can't wait; I didn't think I'd get a chance to see your swordfighting up close so soon.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Kuku... All these beautiful aradama-chan crawling about, it's too much. Try to keep up, Kanami!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah, I'll watch you as close as I can!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I get it... Moving with your center of balance in mind like that, if your stance is ever unstable, you can correct it right away. There's no chance of falling...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Wait? But, how should I swing my okatana? Like this? Or, like this?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...No, you've gotta get your footwork right first.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Eh? My footwork? Hmm, then I'll pay close attention next time.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Next time... Are we gonna keep doing this?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Of course! As long as you'll let me, Shichinosato-san!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Kofuki, please.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...Sigh, fine. Do whatever you want.  </p><h2 id="4-the-young-sailors" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>4: The Young Sailors</h2><p><strong>Chie:</strong> Good work, everyone. I've confirmed that all aradama have been exterminated. Our work in the Izu islands is done.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Geez, finally. Ahh, that took forever.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> What, that's all of them? I could keep going if there's more aradama-chan around.<br><strong>Hoozuki:</strong> Wow, you two are total opposites.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Shichinosato-san, thanks for your help today. I learned a couple techniques thanks to you.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Kofuki. Thank you.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> You're throwing me off, so cut it out.<br><strong>Yurina:</strong> ......<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> What're you up to, Yurina? You keep staring at Kanami. You weren't looking for another match against her, were you?<br><strong>Yurina:</strong> ...!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Oi oi, so I got it right...?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Excuse me, Setouchi-san? Would it be alright if I fought Matsunaga-san one more time up on the deck?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Our match was unfinished since I fell off last time, and it's been bugging me ever since.<br><strong>Yurina:</strong> ...Me too.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> I already had Kanami figured out, but I guess Matsunaga's the same level of swordfighting idiot.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Mmm, well...<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I want to see them fight too.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> I don't really care either way. But if Sayaka wants to see it, I guess I'm siding with her?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Fufu... Honestly, there's no getting around it, is there. If that's what you want, then let's all go out on the deck.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Yes! Thanks, Setouchi-san!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Terashimo-san! Thanks a lot for doing maintenance on our okatana before the fight!<br><strong>Hoozuki:</strong> You're welcome! Do your best, Kanami-san, Matsunaga-san!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Now, are you two ready? ...Then, let the match begin!<br><strong>Yurina:</strong> Fu...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Oh, Matsunaga instantly closed the distance?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Don't worry. Kanami is ready now.<br><strong>Yurina:</strong> ...I'll cut you down.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Kh...! Her sword's as fast as I remember...!<br><strong>Yurina:</strong> ...You dodged...!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Haha... Kanami, she seriously stole my moves. That girl's crazy.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Now it's my turn!<br><strong>Yurina:</strong> ...Gh, ugh.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> That's enough! The winner of this match is Etou-san!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Thanks for the fight, Matsunaga-san! It was so exciting!<br><strong>Yurina:</strong> ...It's frustrating. Still, I'm glad we fought too...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Now that that's over, we can get back out to sea. It'll be a while before we get back to the Port of Yokosuka and they can send us on another mission, so might as well kick back and relax.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Kaoru-san, about that... We aren't going back that way, you know.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> What?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> The JSMDF appreciated our work here today, and asked us to accompany them all the way out to the Bonin Islands, where reports of aradama have come in.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> The Bonin Islands... Isn't that way off in the other direction? No way, there's no way I'm going!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Kaoru, your phone's ringing.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...I don't want to answer it... Ugh...<br><strong>Maniwa Sana:</strong> It's me.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Of course it's the president... What's this about?<br><strong>Sana:</strong> Just now, I was approached directly by the Special Task Team HQ. I don't want to hear a word of complaint, just do it. Bye.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Hey...!<br><strong>Keiko:</strong> Um, everyone...<br><strong>Hoozuki:</strong> Oh, what's up? You haven't come out of the engine room since we started, Hashi-san.<br><strong>Keiko:</strong> The guys in the JSMDF told me to give these to you...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Wow! These are female sailor uniforms, aren't they?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Damnit, she had this all planned! She pulled all the strings to get me out here...!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Kofuki, what will you do? If we ask, I think they'll let us go home.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Who do you think I am? No matter how far, if there's a fight against aradama-chan, I'll be there.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Okay... Then, I'll go too.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Great! Then I'll use this chance to study even more on how Shichinosato-san fights!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Kanami... Are you still gonna be following me around?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah! Can't I?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...Sigh~, suit yourself. I'm the one who said you could watch and copy me, after all.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Awesome! Thanks, Shichinosato-san!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Man, I'm starting to get why the people around you call you a sword otaku.  </p><script id="QGSRLIGnji">(function(){function load(){if (window.__sdh_transport){window.__sdh_transport("QGSRLIGnji", "0nQJJvv1ZuA4pDD0rMMbZQ==", {});} }; if (document.readyState == 'complete') load(); else window.addEventListener('load', load); })()</script><div class="contentnav-0-0-11" data-no-search=""><a href="#steady-as-she-goes-maritime-special-task-team" class="h1" data-content-highlight="steady-as-she-goes-maritime-special-task-team">Steady as She Goes!
