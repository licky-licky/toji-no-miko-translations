There&#x27;s already so many stands set up! I can&#x27;t wait for the festival to start~.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Tsubakuro-san. By running around like that, you&#x27;re obstructing the people constructing stands and transporting goods.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Yomi&#x27;s right, Yume. We came here with Yukari-sama to lead and the supervise the toji joining in the festival, as part of giving back to the community.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ehhh, but it&#x27;s boring if that&#x27;s all we get to do-.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Hey, Yukari-sama~? After the festival gets started, we can go around and check out whatever we want, right-?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> We aren&#x27;t here to play, Yume. Our mission here is simply to patrol the area.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh~...<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> So long as you remember not to neglect your patrol, I don&#x27;t mind if you enjoy the festivities.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Okay! Just leave the patrolling to me~. Which stand should I go eat at first~?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Onee-sans, what do you want to go see?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> There&#x27;s nothing I want to see in particular.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Can&#x27;t we just go around seeing whatever you&#x27;re interested in, Yume?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> But we&#x27;re all here at a festival? You have to have a good time too! So think about it harder, okay?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ah, that one over there looks good-! I&#x27;ll be right back!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> She&#x27;s been caught up in the festival spirit before we even started.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> She said she had gone together with her parents when she was younger.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ...I see. In that case... I guess there&#x27;s no helping it then.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Hm? Something&#x27;s causing a commotion over that way.<br>
<strong>Festival Prepping Toji:</strong> I-I have a report to make...!<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> What is it?<br>
<strong>Festival Prepping Toji:</strong> Aradama seem to have stolen the paper lanterns we used as decorations! We ourselves spotted several aradama fleeing with lanterns caught on them...!<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Aradama are taking the lanterns? What&#x27;s the meaning of this?<br>
<strong>Festival Prepping Toji:</strong> I&#x27;m not sure, but... The aradama with the lanterns are just marching around the festival area, so it doesn&#x27;t seem like there&#x27;s been any serious damage caused yet.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Hm... It&#x27;s a bizarre case, but we can hardly hold the festival if there are aradama here.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Yukari-sama, with the help of the toji on patrol, we will clear out these aradama and recover the stolen lanterns.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Good then; include investigating these aradama as part of your mission, and see it done.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Yes ma&#x27;am!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> We all came to the festival, so I don&#x27;t want any aradama going and ruining it!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Though, won&#x27;t it be really annoying getting the lanterns back?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Without the lanterns, the festival&#x27;s atmosphere will be spoiled. The pleasant mood of the festival is its greatest charm.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Well, if Yomi-onee-san says so, then I&#x27;ll try not to break the lanterns.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Come on, let&#x27;s go take care of this fast.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ...Wait, don&#x27;t go on your own!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I&#x27;ll guide the civilians away from here and reunite with you later. Yomi-san, please support the two of them.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Understood. Then, Yukari-sama... I will be going now.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Right, best of luck.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="2-sharing-the-festival-with-everyone"></a>2: Sharing the Festival with Everyone!<a class="hash-link" href="#2-sharing-the-festival-with-everyone" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Yukari:</strong> Excellent work, not only with suppressing the aradama, but also with directing the other toji. With your efforts, the situation was put under control before much harm could be done.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> The paper lanterns were safely recovered as well. It may have been delayed half an hour, but the festival should be ready to open shortly.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> The festival~, the festival~.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> It seems it&#x27;s started.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Then, let&#x27;s go-!<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Wait, Yume.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh... But you said I could look around the festival before~.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> I have here yukata for the four of you. Once you&#x27;ve changed, you may enjoy the festival to the fullest.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Wow! Now it really feels like a festival!! Thanks, Yukari-sama!<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> That&#x27;s right. You should thank Yuzuki... Ayanokouji&#x27;s president. She&#x27;s the one who prepared these.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Okay! Anyway, I&#x27;m gonna go change!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> We should follow along with her.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> We can&#x27;t exactly ignore this offer, after all.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> This takoyaki is yummy! Yomi-onee-san, I&#x27;ll give you a bite too, eat up.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Thank you... Ohm, mm, it&#x27;s a little hot... Though it is tasty.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I told you~. I think it&#x27;s even better than the takoyaki I usually have?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Fufu... On top of shaved ice and chocolate bananas, they&#x27;re offering buttered potatoes as well.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Suzuka. This came up when you were looking at the food stalls around New Year&#x27;s, but is buttered potato one of your favorites?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> That&#x27;s right. I don&#x27;t often get to sample them, so the moment I do see them, I always want to have a taste.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ah, you can scoop for goldfish there! Can I try that?<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Fine, go on.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> You better watch, okay~? I&#x27;m gonna catch a whole bunch of them!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Geez, why can&#x27;t I catch a single goldfish~!?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> If you shout so loudly, you&#x27;ll alert the goldfish.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> But they keep swimming away as soon as I try! Hey hey, onee-sans, show me how to do it-.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Do your best to show her how it&#x27;s done, Maki-san, Yomi-san. I will cheer you on.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Hey... That&#x27;s no fair, Suzuka.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Understood. I will give it a try.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Kh... So Yomi&#x27;s taking this seriously. Mister, give me a scoop too. If I&#x27;m going to do this, I don&#x27;t want to lose.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ...Then, prepare yourself.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Yomi-onee-san... How&#x27;d you get so good at scooping goldfish!? The old guy running the stall looked like he was gonna cry halfway through.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Indeed... That&#x27;s quite the haul. I was surprised as well.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I may have overdone it. So I made sure to return some of them.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Why... couldn&#x27;t I catch a single one...?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Everyone has their strengths and weaknesses. You excel at so many other things, Maki-san.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Suzuka...<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> You seemed to want these goldfish, Tsubakuro-san, but are you going to look after them?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Can I!?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Though, festival goldfish live very short lives. Will you keep them regardless?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Hmmm. Even if that&#x27;s true, since you caught them for me, I&#x27;ll let them live for a really long time!<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> It seems the fireworks have begun.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Woww-, they&#x27;re so pretty-!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yes, they truly are...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> TAMAYA-!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> What&#x27;s that?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> It&#x27;s something you&#x27;re supposed to shout when fireworks are going off, though I&#x27;m not really sure why.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Huh, I didn&#x27;t know!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> TA-MAYA-! This is kinda fun!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I hope we get to see the fireworks together again next year-.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ah! We can all set off fireworks together next time!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Fireworks, huh. It&#x27;s been a while since I did them myself.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> It wouldn&#x27;t have quite the same atmosphere as this, but it sounds highly entertaining.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> So long as you take proper caution with the fire, I&#x27;ll allow it.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> You&#x27;ll allow it... But you&#x27;ll be doing it with us, Yukari-sama?<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> I will?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> We&#x27;re making a promise!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Pinky swear, and whoever lies, they get a needle in their eye~!  </p><div class="videoWrapper"><iframe width="640" height="480" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jdKVXQRmnJ0"></iframe></div><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="yukata-yomi-start-we-mustnt-get-lost"></a>[Yukata Yomi: Start]: We Mustn&#x27;t Get Lost<a class="hash-link" href="#yukata-yomi-start-we-mustnt-get-lost" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Yume:</strong> That yukata really matches you, Yomi-onee-san. It looks good-.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Thank you very much. I&#x27;m thankful for President Souraku&#x27;s good judgment.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> You look very good in yours as well, Tsubakuro-san.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Don&#x27;t I-? When I saw it, I thought, President Souraku knows her stuff! My yukata&#x27;s so cute!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Yume.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Eh... Wah!?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> The crowd&#x27;s thick. If you don&#x27;t look where you&#x27;re going, you&#x27;ll bump into someone.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Actually, what&#x27;s with this huge line!?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Business is booming. What could it be for?<br>
<strong>Stall Managing Toji:</strong> Ah, the elite guard, with Yukari-sama...! This line is for our yakisoba.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> ...!<br>
<strong>Stall Managing Toji:</strong> Yakisoba seemed popular at festivals in the past, so we tried copying that, but this was more than I imagined...<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> I see.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Yukari-sama... If you&#x27;d like some, I could stand in line for you?<br>
<strong>Stall Managing Toji:</strong> Yukari-sama herself... Wants to try our yakisoba!?<br>
<strong>Stall Managing Toji:</strong> I-I&#x27;ll bring you some straight away...!<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> ...No, stop. The two of you needn&#x27;t concern yourselves with me.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> With all these people in line, I shouldn&#x27;t be the only one to receive special treatment.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Yomi, you have your duty to patrol and observe the area. As for the yakisoba... That&#x27;s right. If any is left over, I will have some then.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> As you wish.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Don&#x27;t let it bother you. Now then, we&#x27;ll look around elsewhere. We have to ensure no one is hurt or in trouble.<br>
<strong>Stall Managing Toji:</strong> ...Y-Yes ma&#x27;am!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Is Yukari-sama okay with that-? With how long that line is, won&#x27;t they run out quick for sure?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> If Yukari-sama insists, we shouldn&#x27;t object any further.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh, but she looked like she wanted to have some-.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> We&#x27;re going, you two. We can&#x27;t allow Yukari-sama to go on ahead by herself.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> We can&#x27;t afford to get lost either. Will you take my hand, Tsubakuro-san?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Guess I don&#x27;t have a choice, huh~. We&#x27;d be in a lot of trouble if you got lost, Yomi-onee-san.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes, I&#x27;ll feel better this way. Let&#x27;s go join them.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Okay!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="yukata-yomi-end-someday-in-memory"></a>[Yukata Yomi: End]: Someday, in Memory<a class="hash-link" href="#yukata-yomi-end-someday-in-memory" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Yume:</strong> Ah, there&#x27;s this thing with all these little balls floating in the water! Hey hey, what is this?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I&#x27;m not quite sure what all these balls are for...<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> They&#x27;re for super ball scooping.<br>
<strong>Yume/Suzuka:</strong> ...Super ball?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Why are they super?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Their repulsive force is super. If you throw them against the wall or floor, they bounce off with great force. And also, the rugby ball shaped ones bounce unpredictably.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> They sound fun! I want some! I can try scooping them, can&#x27;t I?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Fine by me; go ahead.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I&#x27;ll get a whole lot, so I&#x27;ll give you some too, Suzuka-onee-san!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Good. I&#x27;ll look forward to it.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Allow me to offer some advice before you attempt it. It&#x27;s a common misconception, but it&#x27;s actually harder for the scoop to be broken if you let it fully soak in the water.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Wait, really!?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> If only a part of it is wet, it will break more easily. Also, I suggest not aiming for larger ones and many at once.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Thanks for the tips, Yomi-onee-san.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> You did it, Tsubakuro-san.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Wasn&#x27;t it way easier than the goldfish though, cause they aren&#x27;t moving around on their own-?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Wait, where&#x27;s Suzuka-onee-san and Maki-onee-san?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Over there, eating shaved ice.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> You can&#x27;t go to a summer festival without trying this.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Strawberry, melon, lemon, blue hawaii... They had so many choices that I couldn&#x27;t make my mind up.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> You went with blue hawaii, didn&#x27;t you?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I couldn&#x27;t imagine how it would taste. I only chose it on your recommendation. It&#x27;s sweet and rather good.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> The only downside is it turns your tongue blue.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Fufu, and what&#x27;s wrong with that? I find that sort of thing funny.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I had a feeling you&#x27;d say something like that.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Hey...!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ah! Lucky-. We should get some shaved ice too!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I agree. What flavor would you like, Tsubakuro-san?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Strawberry!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Understood. I&#x27;ll go buy it, so please wait here for a moment.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I&#x27;ll just go with you!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> That reminds me, earlier, I saw an Ichigo Daifuku Neko mask in one of the stalls.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Wait, you did!?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Should we go buy that first?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> ...Isn&#x27;t wearing masks sort of for kids-? I do like Ichigo Daifuku Neko though.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Do you think so? I think it would be cute if you wore it, Tsubakuro-san.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> W-Well... If you say so, Yomi-onee-san, then maybe we can go look around for it a little, after we get shaved ice.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I think that&#x27;s a good idea.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Festivals sure are fun, huh.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes, very much so.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations/edit/docs/On_a_Nice_Cool_Evening_Yukata_at_the_Summer_Festival.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_2_ui" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_3DPF"></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"></div></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_35-E thin-scrollbar"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#1-festival-excitement-floating-lanterns" class="table-of-contents__link">1: Festival Excitement, Floating Lanterns</a></li><li><a href="#2-sharing-the-festival-with-everyone" class="table-of-contents__link">2: Sharing the Festival with Everyone!</a></li><li><a href="#yukata-yomi-start-we-mustnt-get-lost" class="table-of-contents__link">Yukata Yomi: Start: We Mustn&#39;t Get Lost</a></li><li><a href="#yukata-yomi-end-someday-in-memory" class="table-of-contents__link">Yukata Yomi: End: Someday, in Memory</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Links</div><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://pastebin.com/LdyviZ8Z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Translator anon&#x27;s pastebin<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Site source code<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Built with Docusaurus.</div></div></div></footer></div>
