Is there any need for a unit like this...<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Currently, there is a mixed unit from all the Five Traditions on a mission to investigate the Akabane swords. If all goes well, the number of okatana in our possession should steadily rise from here.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> In which case, we may find that there aren't enough toji to pair with these okatana.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> In order to protect the people, the more toji we have, the better. If we use this unit wisely, there's a chance it will increase the number of toji applicants.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Still...<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Do you disapprove? Maki.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> ......<br><strong>Maki:</strong> No. If you make the order, Yukari-sama, I will use all the power given to the elite guard to fulfill it. I have no complaints.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Good. Then, begin at once.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Understood. I will prepare a unit capable of accomplishing this mission. The Special Ritual Riot Squad Distinguished Publicity Unit--<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Hereby known as, the Toji Cheer Squad!!<br><strong>Takatsu Yukina:</strong> Just now, Yukari-sama sent an order down to each of the Five Traditions. A toji from each school will undergo a selection exam to take part in a unit undergoing a special mission.<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> Sayaka, you are my masterpiece. This is a chance to prove the vast difference between you and these other toji.<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> Pass their selection, and be acknowledged by Yukari-sama.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I will. This special mission... What is it about?<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> Cheerleading.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ............Cheer leading?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Has everyone arrived?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Yes! Everyone's here!<br><strong>Naruse Miki:</strong> Though everyone is just the five of us, isn't it~?  
<strong>Yui:</strong> I'm here, I'm here! When I heard they wanted someone for such a delicious event, I threw both my hands up!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Ah, you're here too, Sayaka-chan?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm. President Takatsu ordered me to be here.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Osafune's Kohagura Ellen, Heijou's Naruse Miki, Ayanokouji's Yamashiro Yui, Minoseki's Yanase Mai, Renpu's Itomi Sayaka--<br><strong>Maki:</strong> So you five are each school's nominees.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Makimaki? What are the five of us going to be doing here? We came all the way to this inn out in the mountains.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> You should have heard; all of you are applicants nominated to join the Toji Cheer Squad.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> In order to advertise the position of toji, this squad will improve our image.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> As this is a direct proposal from Yukari-sama, I won't accept any half-hearted effort. You'll acquire the skills necessary to put on the perfect cheerleading performance.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> To make that happen, you'll now be participating in a special cheerleading training camp!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Camp! So I'll be camping under the same roof with all these cuties...!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Ahh, I-I'm not sure I'll be able to control myself! I'll apologize in advance! If anything happens, sorry!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> If anything happens... Like what, exactly?<br><strong>Miki:</strong> I think it's best not to pry into that. At least, that's what my intuition's telling me.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Hm... Well, fine.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> One week from now, Yukari-sama herself will be coming to inspect your performances.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> If she approves of you, only then will you be officially accepted into the Toji Cheer Squad.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> This sounds like fun. If we're going to do it, we might as well give it our best shot!<br><strong>Miki:</strong> Though, cheerleading doesn't exactly sound like a toji's work, does it...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Naruse Miki. This was a direct order from Yukari-sama herself. I won't allow you to take it lightly.<br><strong>Miki:</strong> I-I understand that~. So please stop glaring at me..<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...I'll do my best.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Good. Starting now, all of you should aim to become the ultimate cheerleaders!  </p><h2 id="2-cheerleaders-in-training" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>2: Cheerleaders, in Training!</h2><p><strong>Maki:</strong> We'll start with your stamina! Run for one hour through the mountains. Afterwards, we'll do squats, sit ups, and push ups.<br><strong>Miki:</strong> Pant~ pant~... Why... Are we doing something so sporty...?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Cheerleading works as a sort of endurance match too!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I'll do my best.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Next you'll be learning the fundamental techniques. Beginning with stunts, and then forming a pyramid!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Stunts...?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Stunts are a part of the act as a cheerleader. A pyramid is made up of a combination of stunts. Now, let's get started!<br><strong>Miki:</strong> Th-This got hard all of a sudden...<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I'll do my best.<br>And so their practicing continued... After several days passed...</p><p><strong>Maki:</strong> Jump, step, watch those feet! Focus!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Good, stop. You all seem like you're getting used to this.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I could do this much before breakfast!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Though-- Itomi Sayaka. Your movements are perfect, but there's still a stiffness that you can't get rid of.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Stiffness...?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> According to my cheerleading textbook, showing emotion through your expression is essential... You need to work on that from now on.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Who wants to get in the bath with me!? The bath! We should all take a bath, you know! Have to take one right away!<br><strong>Miki:</strong> Why are you still so worked up...?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> What's wrong, Sayaka-chan? You look down.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Shidou Maki told me before... I can't get rid of my stiffness.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I thought I was doing everything right. But, I'm missing something... I don't know what to do.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> We all only just started cheerleading. I don't think you should worry about it so much.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> But President Takatsu said I have to get Origami Yukari's acknowledgement and become a cheer toji. I have to do my best...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Sayaka-chan...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I know! In that case, why not get some pointers from someone more skilled? You might learn something useful.<br>The next day--</p><p><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Shidou Maki. Please teach me some pointers.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Sayaka-chan is worried... She wants to hear some advice from you.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> ...Sorry. I don't know anything about cheerleading myself, so I can't teach you anything that's not in the textbook...<br><strong>Miki:</strong> Eh-! Is that true!?  
<strong>Yui:</strong> That won't do~. If you want to teach someone, you have to be able to do it yourself!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Ahh, seeing Shidou-san dancing around cheerleading... I'd pay to see that! In fact, I need to see it, pant, pant...!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> No, I'm not going to be one of the cheer toji; I'm just your coach and judge... There's no need for a coach to master the sport.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Makimaki, there's a phone call for you.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> ...For some reason... I have a strong feeling that I shouldn't answer this...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Hello, Maki-san?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Yes. What's going on, Suzuka.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yukari-sama asked me to pass along a message to you just now.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> "I forgot to mention this, but you're also assigned to participate as a member of the cheer toji." ...Is the message she left me.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> What... Did you say...!?  
<strong>Yui:</strong> Hooray-! Now Shidou-san has no choice but to be a cheerleader with us!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Kh...!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...Shidou Maki wasn't a cheerleading expert... Who else knows how...?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> What about Naruse-san and Yamashiro-san?<br><strong>Miki:</strong> Eh, you want me to teach you? I'm hardly any better.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> I've been too busy watching the other girls cheering with all they've got, so I'm not that confident in my own skills.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Then that leaves... Ellen-chan?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Hm? You need me?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Yeah, yeah, yeah! Finish!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Wow, Ellen-chan, your cheering is so good!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Fu fu fu! America is the home of cheerleading, after all! Of course I'm good at it!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I don't think that's the reason though... But Ellen is the best.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Ellen, teach me the techniques for cheerleading.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> And I'll practice with you. If that's alright with you, Ellen-chan.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> It's okay! Just leave it to me!  </p><h2 id="3-final-exam" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>3: Final Exam</h2><p>And so, after several days--</p><p><strong>Ellen:</strong> Right, left, right, left, do a spin, and jump!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...I did it.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I think I did it right too.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Excellent! You two are in perfect sync.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> And you, Saaya, your stiffness from before is gone! Very good!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Thank you. It's because you taught me.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Non non, Saaya. I didn't do anything.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> But you're the one who taught me how to get better.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> You've always been so physically fit, Saaya, so your cheerleading techniques were already perfect.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> But your expression was too stiff. You looked like a beautiful doll, being puppeteered around...<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I did...?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> But when you were with Maimai, you were making such a happy face. So Maimai is actually the reason you're doing better!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> If you want to thank anyone, you should be thanking her.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I see... Mai, thank you.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Eh!? I-I didn't do anything though.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Ahaha, looks like Maimai's the perfect medicine for Saaya after all!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> When you two were cheering just now, you were so coordinated you looked like sisters!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> If Mai were my sister... That wouldn't be bad.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> S-Sayaka-chan!?  
<strong>Maki:</strong> Today marks the end of the training camp. Finally, Yukari-sama herself will be judging all of you. If she approves, you will be officially admitted into the Toji Cheer Squad.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> This is an official mission you have been assigned as toji. Show me your fullest potential, the same as you would if you were suppressing aradama.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Are you going to be cheering too, Makimaki?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> I've been practicing every waking moment since then... As a member of the elite guard, failure here isn't an option.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Now then, one by one, show me your performances as a cheerleader.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Good, Naruse Miki. You pass.<br><strong>Miki:</strong> Thank you very much.<br><strong>Miki:</strong> Phew~, thank goodness~. If you want to stand out, you can't wait for others to go ahead of you.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Yamashiro Yui, pass.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Yes, I did it! I had to make it into this unit to be around those cute cheerleaders, after all!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Kohagura Ellen, pass.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Of course!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Shidou Maki, pass. That was a good performance.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Thank you very much.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> ...If only I'd brought Suzuka here to see this.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> P-Please don't joke like that, Yukari-sama!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Yanase Mai, pass.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Phew... Thank you very much.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Lastly... Itomi Sayaka.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Yes.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> (Her expression is stiff. This type of role might not be suited for Itomi Sayaka...)<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Sayaka-chan, relax your shoulders. I'll be here with you.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mai... Mm, okay.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> (...Hm. She was able to relax herself when she needed to.)<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> --Finish.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Good. Itomi Sayaka, you pass.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Good...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> You did it, Sayaka-chan!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm. Thank you, Mai.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> All of you passed. You've done well, putting on these performances after such a short period of time.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Now then... In the coming days, you'll have your final practical test.  </p><h2 id="4-formation-of-the-toji-cheer-squad" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>4: Formation of the Toji Cheer Squad</h2><p><strong>Ellen:</strong> So our final test is putting us in actual combat!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Recently, there's been a number of reports of aradama appearing around this stadium.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> If aradama appear while a game is taking place, a significant number of people in the stadium could be in danger.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> If aradama do appear, we need to defeat them right away...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> That's how it is. For that reason, the Toji Cheer Squad will be standing by here in the stadium.<br><strong>Miki:</strong> On top of that, even though we're meant to be cheer toji, we're still wearing our ordinary uniforms, aren't we?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Sighhh~... What a letdown... I was so looking forward to everyone dressing up like cheerleaders.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Ahaha... Still, I'm sort of relieved. It would be a little embarrassing fighting wearing something like that...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> That's for sure...<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> --! The spectrum finder is detecting something...!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Looks like the aradama are already here. Let's go!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Stop right there!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Oh, Hanahana, are you our backup?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I'm only here to deliver these clothes. The finishing touches took longer than expected, but here you are: the official uniforms of the Special Ritual Riot Squad Distinguished Publicity Unit.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> What... Are these...!?  
<strong>Ellen:</strong> WOW! Real cheerleader uniforms!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> This is what cheerleaders have to wear, is it...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Yessssss!! Cheerleader uniforms for everyone! I can't believe my eyes!<br><strong>Miki:</strong> Don't get too excited...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> You'll carry out your mission while wearing these, everyone.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> And Yukari-sama has asked me to remind you to do your cheerleading performance after you're done fighting.<br>Several days later--</p><p><strong>Kanami:</strong> Check it out, Mai-chan, Sayaka-chan! They put up a video of the cheer toji on the internet!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> It's true.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> So they recorded it after all... When we were fighting wearing that.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> The number of views... Is a lot. It's over one million.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> They said cheerleading would improve our image and make others want to join... But is this really going to make more girls want to be toji...?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I'm sure it will! I mean, see how cute you all look!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Oh, see, this is the part where you and Sayaka-chan started cheering after beating that aradama.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...Mm, I get it.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> ? What do you mean, Sayaka-chan?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I... Had more fun than I thought.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> (I'm glad I was able to do what President Takatsu asked me to... But, doing it with my friends... Was a little fun too.)  </p><script id="WybEPlyFWM">(function(){function load(){if (window.__sdh_transport){window.__sdh_transport("WybEPlyFWM", "0nQJJvv1ZuA4pDD0rMMbZQ==", {});} }; if (document.readyState == 'complete') load(); else window.addEventListener('load', load); })()</script><div class="contentnav-0-0-11" data-no-search=""><a href="#assemble-toji-cheer-squad" class="h1" data-content-highlight="assemble-toji-cheer-squad">Assemble!
