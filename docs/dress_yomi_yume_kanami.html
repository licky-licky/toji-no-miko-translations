However, I think it would be a waste for us to be the only ones enjoying it...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> That's true, especially when there's a whole truck of them...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Hey, hey, what are you talking about? Enjoying what?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Plenty of flowers bloomed in a garden my family manages, so they were donated to the Origami family as a gift.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> We were just talking about how it would be wasteful for only the Origami family to appreciate them.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> What, that's it? Then just have a big flower party and invite everybody to come see!<br><strong>Akane:</strong> I see, that does sound nice. We might as well send invitations to every toji and person related to the Five Traditions then.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Wonderful. My father would be delighted to hear it too.<br><strong>Akane:</strong> Could I ask you all to help with preparing the party venue and sending invitations?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Sure thing! It's going to take some work.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> If toji onee-sans are coming from all around the country, I can't wait!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Then, how about we get right to dividing up our roles? We should have some in charge of creating and preparing the party venue, some in charge of getting in touch with all those invited, and...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> If there's anything you'd like to be in charge of, go ahead and volunteer.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Then, I'd like to volunteer...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> I didn't think you'd be the one to volunteer yourself... So, what'd you want to do?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> On the day of the party, everyone should be away, so I thought I could be in charge of staying behind here.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Huhh? Wait, so then, you're not coming to the party, Yomi-onee-san?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Right. I don't do very well with busy places.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ehhh; you can't do that! You have to go-!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> If we're throwing a party, all of us have to be there! Can't you just go?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Even if I did... I feel like it would be a problem if all of us were away from the Origami estate.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> You do have a point; it wouldn't be much of a way to thank the other toji for their efforts if we also left our posts...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> It's only right for some of us to stay behind.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Alright; I'll watch the place together with Yomi then.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Huhh!? There's no way the both of you can't go, Maki-onee-san!<br><strong>Akane:</strong> If you're worried about it, I have a good solution.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> You were listening in, Akane-sama? What'd you have in mind...?<br><strong>Akane:</strong> What if we held the party within the grounds of the Origami estate?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Within the Origami estate...?<br><strong>Akane:</strong> It doesn't see much use, but we do have a banquet hall we can decorate for the party.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> That'll do it! No matter what comes up, we can be right there to deal with it.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Good suggestion, Akane-sama. Yomi-san, you'll be there at the party as security for the Origami family, won't you?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ...It seems I'll have to. If it's my mission, I'll make sure everyone attending the party is protected.  </p><h2 id="dress-21---yomi-end-the-party-guards-outfits" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Dress '21 - Yomi: End]: The Party Guards' Outfits!?</h2><p>The day of the party.</p><p><strong>Yume:</strong> The guests'll be here soon! Yomi-onee-san, let's put our dresses on!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Our dresses...? Wasn't it my duty to be guarding the party today?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Everyone will be dressed up, so wouldn't you be all the more conspicuous if you were the only one in uniform?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> That's why they say, if you want to hide a leaf, do it in a forest.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I see; in that case...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> For the party today, I had lovely dresses with a flower motif prepared for us all. Come along, let's get changed.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> We put it on-! How's it look?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Wow; you all look fantastic!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Eheheh! It's nice getting to go to the party in these cute dresses, huh, Yomi-onee-san!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> It is. I shouldn't be surprised, since Konohana-san prepared them for us, but I'm relieved at how easy they are to move around in.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> It might be a little early, but since we've finished getting dressed, why don't we go to the banquet hall?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Sure! Y'know, you didn't want to come before, but you got excited for this too, didn't you, Yomi-onee-san!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> No, that's not it... I only wanted to give the area a full check before the guests arrived.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Boo-. Even though she's in such a cute dress, she still won't get out of work mode.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> That's one of Yomi-san's virtues.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Whoa-! Look, Yomi-onee-san! There's flowers put up everywhere!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I never expected them to send us this many flowers...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> It looks like there's a big flower stand out in the courtyard too! Let's go see!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Please slow down, Tsubakuro-san. You're going to trip over if you run that fast.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> But it's so pretty out here! Let's have a lot of fun at the party, Yomi-onee-san!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Alright. I'll be sure to keep on guard, so that you and all the other guests can enjoy it.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Boo-... You're still talking about that stuff? We're all at the party, so we'd all be missing out if we didn't have fun together.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Yume's right. Couldn't we trade off so we all have time to enjoy the party?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Still... If, by some chance, a suspicious person arrived...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> If that were to happen, they'd have all the toji from across the nation to contend with.<br><strong>Akane:</strong> With how many toji will be gathered here, this could be one of the safest places in Japan.<br><strong>Akane:</strong> So please, try to enjoy yourself tonight, Yomi-san.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Akane-sama... I understand. If that's part of my mission, I'll try to enjoy it as well.<br><a href="https://streamable.com/keti2l">https://streamable.com/keti2l</a></p><h2 id="dress-21---yume-start-you-excited-its-the-spring-flower-party" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Dress '21 - Yume: Start]: You Excited? It's the Spring Flower Party!</h2><p><strong>Yume:</strong> Hey, hey, Yomi-onee-san! All the people coming to the party today are toji, aren't they?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Not exactly all of them, but everyone from the Five Traditions was invited, so the majority should be toji.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> That's a lot though! So, who do you think's the strongest of them all?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I can't really tell, so I think I'll just challenge whoever I feel like!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yume, we're all here today to appreciate the flowers, not to fight amongst each other.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> That's right. And besides, our job here is to act as guards.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> We're keeping this up until late tonight, so you're going to wear yourself out if you're getting too excited first thing.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> We're doing this until night? Didn't they say we were just guarding during the day?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Oh yeah; you're only in charge of the day part, aren't you.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> The day part? So that means the party's still going on at night too?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Akane-sama proposed that we split the party into two parts, for the toji who couldn't arrive during the day due to their missions.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> She did? So wait, then, I can just be a normal guest for the night part, right?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Sure; but don't get too carried away with it.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Nice-!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ah-- There's some onee-sans over there! Heyyy!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Oh; Yume-chan! Come and look! They decorated this cake with flowers all over; isn't it cute?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Wow; it really is! --Wait, forget that, come out to the courtyard with me, Onee-san!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Huh? The courtyard? Did you want to look at the flowers together?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Not that-! There's a whole bunch of toji coming here today, so we're going to have a big match to see who's the strongest!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> That sounds cool! You'll come too, right, Hiyori-chan?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Hmm... If you say so, then I guess I have to.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> That'll be fun! Let me in too-!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Yayyy, more and more people are coming! I can fight anybody I want! So, who should I beat first-?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Hey, Yume! The moment I take my eyes off you, you're already starting something.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Our team's duty is to act as security for the venue today.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> You're meant to mingle naturally amongst the partygoers while keeping an eye on things...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Boo... But for me though, fighting with everybody's the most natural thing to do.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> You might be right, but you are on duty, at least during the day. Please bear with it.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Fiiine...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ahh, I'm so bored. They said just to enjoy the party normally, so I ate the food, and talked, and...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Yawwwn. Now I'm feeling tired cause I'm full.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Zzzzzzzzzzzz......<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Yawwwn... Huh? It's dark out...?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> It's sorta quiet too... Wait!? There was all those guests and now I don't see anybody!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Does that mean; did I sleep through the whole party!?  </p><h2 id="dress-21---yume-end-a-private-time-after-the-party" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Dress '21 - Yume: End]: A Private Time After the Party?</h2><p><strong>Yume:</strong> Wahhh! I don't believe it! The party's seriously over!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Oh, you're awake now, Tsubakuro-san.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Yeah, I'm awake now-! So why didn't you wake me up!?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> You just looked so peaceful sleeping, we'd feel bad waking you up.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> The way you were surrounded by flowers, you were as adorable as Sleeping Beauty.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> See, I took a photo; have a look.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Wow, I really do-! --Wait!! That's not the point!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Didn't you say how, after I was done guarding during the day, I could do what I wanted at night?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Did all the toji onee-sans really leave already?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Yeah. They all said they'd be busy with missions and training again first thing tomorrow morning.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Boo! I was supposed to have a bunch of fights with all the different toji onee-sans!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> What was even the point of having the party now!?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> To appreciate the flowers...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Hey, it's alright; if you want to spar with somebody, I'll do it with you tomorrow.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> You're no good, Maki-onee-san! I wanted to fight with a whole lot more people.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Sigh... I suppose we should have woken you up regardless.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> There's not much we can do now though. Right, Yomi?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Hm...? Where'd Yomi go? Did she go back to her room already?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> We should return as well. I'll have my father send more flowers next year, so we can look forward to having the party again.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Now they're all gone... Aww, and I thought this was going to be a lot of fun with everybody...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Sigh... It's just boring...<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Tsubakuro-san, you're still here. Good.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Yomi-onee-san? Didn't you go back to your room?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I thought about it, but I saw that the bar was still open.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> If you'd like, will you have a drink with me?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Whoa! This cocktail's so pretty! But, is it really okay for somebody young to drink this?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I had them make special non-alcoholic ones.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Neat! Then I'll have some!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> What's with this; it's super yummy! They didn't have this at the party, did they?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> They didn't. Since the orders had slowed down, it seems that they made extra flavorful ones for us.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> So this special cocktail's just for you and me? Thanks, Yomi-onee-san!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I'm glad to see you're feeling better now.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Next year, I want to invite even more toji, and then we can have a really exciting party!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> And then, everybody can have this cocktail there too!

What'd he send?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Fufu, you'll have to see for yourself. There's plenty to go around, so do you want to join us in the waiting room?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Sure we do! I can't to see what it is.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Th-These are all...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Look at all the lovely party dresses!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Go ahead and put on whichever one you like.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Can we!? Wow; they're all so cute, I can't pick just one. What about you, Hiyori-chan?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Hmm, it's tough narrowing it down. This one's nice, but, I don't want to let go of this one...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Oi oi, the party's going to be over before you make up your minds.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> But they're all too cute to settle on just one-.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> They really are. I can see some that'd look good on you, Kanami, but nothing I'd wear...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Same for me; all I keep finding are dresses I think'd look great on you.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> You two sure think a lot about each other. Why don't you just pick out each other's dresses then?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> We could do that. What do you think Kanami?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Let's go with that! I already found the dress that'll look best on you!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I'm a little excited to see what they pick...<br><a href="https://streamable.com/l2taom">https://streamable.com/l2taom</a></p><h2 id="dress-21---kanami-start-off-to-the-dress-up-party" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Dress '21 - Kanami: Start]: Off to the Dress Up Party!</h2><p><strong>Kanami:</strong> I'm going with this one! Here's your dress, Hiyori-chan!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Th-This one...!? Isn't it a little too flashy?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> No way. I know you'll look amazing in it!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> If you say so. Then, here's what I picked. Ever since I saw it, I thought you would look good in it.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Wow, it's so cute! Thanks, Hiyori-chan!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Okay, let's hurry and get you two changed before the party starts wrapping up!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Good, it took a little while to get changed, but we made it back in time.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Yeah, the party's in full swing. Now the real fun can start.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Whoa; Kanami, Juujou-san where'd you get those? Those dresses look super pretty!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> I guess it's a bit too flashy for me after all...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Not at all! You and Etou-san both look so cute.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Mmhm, you're like flower fairies!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> F-Fairies...?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> A flower fairy blushing bright red! Nnnn-- I can't get enough! This is what spring's all about! Spring Has Come!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> H-Hey... Who said you could start taking pictures?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> The model's just too cute; my fingers won't stop-!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Control yourself, Yamashiro Yui. You're being very rude.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Everyone, spring is when perverts start becoming more active. Please be on the lookout. Now, if you'll excuse us.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Ehh-- Mirja-san, let me go-! You don't have to get jealous; you know I love you-!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> She comes and goes like a storm.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> That's one way to put it... I hope we can get those pictures from her later.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Sorry about her... I'll be sure to ask Yui-chan for you.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Sure, thanks. But, I wasn't ready to have my picture taken yet.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> If we're going to take pictures, I'd want a little more time to get mentally ready first.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Then we can take a whole bunch more! There's tons of places in here and the courtyard where we could get good photos!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> If you want, I know a great spot nearby to have your photo taken!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Oh, you mean that place with the sparkling pool?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Yeah! The flowers should be blooming there too, and it's really close by, so why don't you go take your pictures there?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> A sparkling pool? That sounds neat-! Hiyori-chan, let's check it out!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Hey, hang on, Kanami! Don't run so fast!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Let's see, from the map Musumi-san gave me, I think it's around here...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Isn't this place a wedding chapel? Can we just walk on in?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah! They said it's open to the public today. Looks like it's right through this door.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Whoa-! Look, Hiyori-chan, look! There's a pool right in the middle of the garden!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> I didn't think it'd be like this... There's flowers blooming everywhere too; it's amazing.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Wahh-! The petals are all blowing around! Now's our chance!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> H-Hey! I'm still not prepared yet...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Sorry, sorry. Hey, let's take the next shots in front of the pool where all the petals are floating!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> That should be nice too. Seems like we'll get a lot of good pictures today.  </p><script id="zzlTW_IqvN">(function(){function load(){if (window.__sdh_transport){window.__sdh_transport("zzlTW_IqvN", "0nQJJvv1ZuA4pDD0rMMbZQ==", {});} }; if (document.readyState == 'complete') load(); else window.addEventListener('load', load); })()</script><div class="contentnav-0-0-10" data-no-search=""><a href="#dress-yomiyumekanami" class="h1" data-content-highlight="dress-yomiyumekanami">dress yomi/yume/kanami</a><a href="#dress-21---yomi-start-staying-home-during-the-party" class="h2" data-content-highlight="dress-21---yomi-start-staying-home-during-the-party">[Dress '21 - Yomi: Start]: Staying Home During the Party?</a><a href="#dress-21---yomi-end-the-party-guards-outfits" class="h2" data-content-highlight="dress-21---yomi-end-the-party-guards-outfits">[Dress '21 - Yomi: End]: The Party Guards' Outfits!?</a><a href="#dress-21---yume-start-you-excited-its-the-spring-flower-party" class="h2" data-content-highlight="dress-21---yume-start-you-excited-its-the-spring-flower-party">[Dress '21 - Yume: Start]: You Excited?
