I just couldn't take my life full of lies anymore.<br><strong>Hana:</strong> Living as a spy meant telling one lie to bury another.

Even someone who was "just there" like me, the imperial guard accepted.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Tagitsuhime-sama is our savior goddess. I feel sorry for all of you, not understanding how blessed it feels to fight for that goddess.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Savior...? Yui, she saved you from something?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Mm... But, even if I told you about it, it wouldn't do any good.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> You're cute, Mihono-chan, but you can't save me. You can't do anything.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> But...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Is this what the noro did to you? It's clearly different from what they gave to the elite guard, though. This is just brainwashing.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Shouldn't we get started already? If you go easy on us, you're going to die. So take this seriously. Okay, everyone?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Isn't there any other way?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> They're more than happy to fight.

They gave the order to retreat.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Ehh~, but things are finally heating up over here? How am I supposed to turn down something this delicious~!<br><strong>Hana:</strong> One last thing, Mirja-senpai. Some advice for you.<br><strong>Hana:</strong> As an Ayanokouji toji, you should join the imperial guard.
