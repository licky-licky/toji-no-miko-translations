The school pool is finally opening up tomorrow!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Swimming's annoying... Hopefully they'll let me set up a beach chair and just lounge by the poolside.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Then it wouldn't be much of a lesson anymore...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Anyway, since you always get in the bath first, have you heard about "First in the Pool?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Never heard of it. Is it about getting in the pool before anyone else?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> That's half right! Actually, "First in the Pool" is a secret event passed down through generations of toji!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> The way it goes is, the day before the pool opens, you sneak in and swim in it!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Isn't that breaking school rules?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> That's why it's a secret tradition, silly! So, Kaoru, want to sneak into the pool with me after class?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Ehh... It sounds like a lot of trouble...<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Ne-! Ne-!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Look! Nene wants to do it too! He says we can't let the toji tradition end here!<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Ne-! Ne-!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Oi, Nene, cut it out. Quit yanking my hair.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...Fine. I'll tag along for this first pool thing. So give it a rest already.<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Ne-!!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Awesome! I'm glad to hear it! Then, let's meet at 4:00 in front of the pool! I'll get the pool key by then!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> I feel like you just casually said something crazy... About getting the key... By the way, did you tell anyone else?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Just you, me, and Nene is all we need!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> The title of first in the pool can only go to one person after all, so the less rivals the better!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...Hang on. If only one person gets to be first, why'd you invite me?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Isn't it obvious? It's lonely sneaking in by yourself!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Besides, I knew you wouldn't care about being first, so you'd let me have all the glory!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> You're so self-centered. Well, I will let you keep the glory though.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Thank you very much! With the two of us together, no one's going to stop us from getting in there!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...The way you said that has me curious. There won't actually be anything trying to stop us from getting in the pool, will there?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> That's a secret! But make sure you don't forget to bring your okatana, okay!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Something's gonna happen for sure... I should have thought this through before agreeing...  </p><h2 id="2-mihonos-headed-for-the-pool-too" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>2: Mihono's Headed for the Pool Too!</h2><p>During lunch break--</p><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> Hey, guys! Did you know about "First in the Pool"!?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> The day before the pool opens, the first person to go swimming after school gets crowned the first in the pool!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> So who wants to sneak into the pool with me?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Mihono-chan, you shouldn't be breaking into the pool like that.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That's right. If the teachers found out, they'd be really mad at you. And won't we have plenty of swimming lessons after the pool opens tomorrow?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> You're not wrong, but this is supposed to be a tradition passed down by toji for generations, you know!?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I have training after school.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> I'm not interested if there's no aradama-chan involved, so I'll pass.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ughhh... Is nobody gonna come with me...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ahaha... You're hopeless, Mihono-chan. I'd feel bad if you had to go alone, so I'll join you.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Wait, really!? Thanks, Kanami!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> That reminds me, I heard something about this first in the pool thing. There's meant to be some kind of secret organization stopping toji from getting in the pool.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ehh!? There is!?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Yep. They pick up members from active toji, and they call themselves the Pool Police.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> They'd really get police for something this specific...!?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> It's just a nickname. You really think they'd send actual police for this?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Now it's getting interesting! So whoever can win in a fight against them wins the right to be first in the pool, right!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> We can't waste any time! Mihono-chan! To prepare to fight the Pool Police, we should start practicing together right now!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Huh!? Right now!?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Okay! We'll spend the rest of our lunch break warming up-!<br><strong>Koike Saaya:</strong> Okay, okay. So Mihono-chan's trying to be "First in the Pool". Sounds like the Pool Police are in for a rough time again this year.<br><strong>Saaya:</strong> Now then. I should leave the suspects for now and report this to the others straight away.  </p><h2 id="3-24-hour-pool-police" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>3: 24 Hour Pool Police</h2><p>After school, before the entrance to the pool facility--</p><p><strong>Saaya:</strong> --From what I've found, it seems like Etou Kanami-san and Asakura Mihono-san are aiming to be first in the pool.<br><strong>Naeba Wakako:</strong> Really? According to the information Tamaki-san gathered, Mashiko Kaoru-san and Kohagura Ellen-san will attempt to break into the pool as well, won't they?<br><strong>Tamaki Marie:</strong> Yes. The four of them will be tough to stop. I wonder if we can manage it...<br><strong>Wakako:</strong> What are you losing your nerve for? Since we were appointed as Pool Police, we need to stop them no matter what it takes.<br><strong>Wakako:</strong> Besides, we aren't the only members of the Pool Police. We have a strong toji aiding us too, don't we?<br><strong>Marie:</strong> ...Ah, it looks like the last member's here.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> --Thank you for your efforts, everyone.<br><strong>Wakako:</strong> So all four members of this year's Pool Police are now present. Satsuki-san, we'll be counting on you today.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I'll carry out the mission I was given, as a member of the Pool Police.<br><strong>Marie:</strong> It's reassuring, having a member of the elite guard fighting with us.<br><strong>Saaya:</strong> But from what I've heard, for as long as this tradition's been going on, the Pool Police have only won 3 times and lost 22 times. We're on a big losing streak.<br><strong>Wakako:</strong> It's up to the Pool Police to prevent every single toji from getting in.<br><strong>Wakako:</strong> Yet on the other side, only one person needs to make it into the pool. They have quite the advantage against us.<br><strong>Wakako:</strong> However, I believe we can overcome that disadvantage, and show them how strong we really are!<br><strong>Marie:</strong> Right!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...Oi, Ellen. It looks like four people beat us here?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> They must be members of the Pool Police, here to guard the pool.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> The what?<br><strong>Marie:</strong> --Ah! There's Mashiko Kaoru-san and Kohagura Ellen-san!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> They found us out! Kaoru! Get ready to fight!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I'll strike down anyone who attempts to enter the pool.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Are they for real...? I definitely should have thought this one through...  </p><h2 id="4-the-battles-outcome" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>4: The Battle's Outcome</h2><p><strong>Wakako:</strong> Kh... Impressive... You might have worked your way into the facility, but I promise you, you won't even put a toe in the water!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> If you don't want to get hurt, Pool Police, then I suggest you step aside.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I won't let you through. You'll be the ones getting hurt.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> There's no talking our way out of this, huh... I wanted to avoid using force if possible...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> First year from Osafune Girls' Academy high school, Kohagura Ellen, will fight you!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Third seat of the Origami family's elite guard, Satsuki Yomi, will accept your challenge.<br><strong>Saaya:</strong> A-Amazing, they're seriously hacking away at each other, though they are using utsushi...!<br><strong>Marie:</strong> It's a fight between two people with top class skills... There's no room for anyone else to get involved.<br><strong>Wakako:</strong> Everyone! While Satsuki-san takes care of Kohagura-san, let's all stop Mashiko-san!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Wait, hang on a sec. Isn't it insane to seriously fight over getting in a pool of all things?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> I mean, I don't even care about this first pool stuff--<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Oh-! Mihono-chan, they already got started!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> What do we do, Kanami? Wanna fight the Pool Police first?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Let's do it! Ellen-chan! Kaoru-chan! The cavalry's here!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Ah, the ones who are only going to make the situation worse showed up.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Ugh... Do we really have to fight? You could also just let me leave, you know...<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Ne-ne-, nene-!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Ah-! Nene!<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Ne-!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Ahh...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Nene... He just had to pick the worst time to jump in the pool.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> So what happens now? Isn't Nene-chan the first in the pool?<br><strong>Wakako:</strong> I'm not sure... Our objective was to prevent any toji from getting in the pool, but I don't know where an aradama fits in...<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Ne-! Ne-!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Nene wants the rest of us to get in too.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...It kinda makes everything seem silly now.<br><strong>Wakako:</strong> That's true... Since the title of first in the pool was already taken, why don't we call it a truce?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Aww... I never expected Nene would beat me to it.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Mission failed... I was careless...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Anyway, why don't you Pool Police change into swimsuits too and come swimming with us!<br><strong>Saaya:</strong> Yesterday's enemies are today's friends; that's how it goes!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Alright! Everybody get in, we'll see who can swim 25 meters the fastest!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> I mean, we're just going to be doing that in class, so we don't actually have to go swimming now...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Kaoru! Quit being a stick in the mud and put on your swimsuit! Or do I have to take your clothes off for you?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> D-Dumbass! Don't go taking off my clothes in front of everyone!<br><strong>Wakako:</strong> This marks the Pool Police's 23rd loss, doesn't it?<br><strong>Saaya:</strong> When the water looks that nice, you can't help but want to swim.<br><strong>Saaya:</strong> Maybe most generations of Pool Police just couldn't resist the temptation.  </p><script id="kxQACTTMsf">(function(){function load(){if (window.__sdh_transport){window.__sdh_transport("kxQACTTMsf", "0nQJJvv1ZuA4pDD0rMMbZQ==", {});} }; if (document.readyState == 'complete') load(); else window.addEventListener('load', load); })()</script><div class="contentnav-0-0-11" data-no-search="" style="max-height: 75vh;"><a href="#battle-for-the-first-in-the-pool" class="h1" data-content-highlight="battle-for-the-first-in-the-pool">Battle for the First in the Pool!</a><a href="#1-the-secret-school-event-first-in-the-pool" class="h2" data-content-highlight="1-the-secret-school-event-first-in-the-pool">1:　The Secret School Event: "First in the Pool"</a><a href="#2-mihonos-headed-for-the-pool-too" class="h2" data-content-highlight="2-mihonos-headed-for-the-pool-too">2: Mihono's Headed for the Pool Too!</a><a href="#3-24-hour-pool-police" class="h2" data-content-highlight="3-24-hour-pool-police">3: 24 Hour Pool Police</a><a href="#4-the-battles-outcome" class="h2" data-content-highlight="4-the-battles-outcome">4: The Battle's Outcome</a></div></div><div id="-codedoc-toc" class="toc-0-0-8"><script>
