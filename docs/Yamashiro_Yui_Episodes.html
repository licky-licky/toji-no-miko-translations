Hiyori-san! Morning! You're looking as lovely as ever today!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> .........<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Huhh? Why are you glaring at me like that?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> I can't stand that kind of empty flattery.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> I'm not lying to you! I think you're beautiful, Hiyori-san! I mean it!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> You go around telling that to everyone, don't you.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> W-Well, I mean... That's because every toji is good looking!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> And I have a disease that'll kill me if I don't compliment every girl I think is cute!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ......That's some disease. Well, it doesn't matter to me either way.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> You're so cold to me, Hiyori-san!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> But you know, I kind of like it when you treat me like that!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...If you don't have anything more to say, I'm going back to my room.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Ehh-! Stay and talk with me for a while! I was thinking you and I could get closer--<br><strong>Academy Intercom:</strong> Aradama have been identified in the area of this academy. Toji, make preparations for emergency sortie. I repeat, aradama have been identified--<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Oh no, Hiyori-san! We should go together and help out!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> And on our way there, we can talk about all kinds of things and deepen our bond with each other!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...Third layer jin'i!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Hey!? Hiyori-san-!? Please don't leave me behind!! Is that how badly you don't want to talk to me!?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Phew... Looks like that's mission complete!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Hiyori-saaaan~, I was so lonely~. Why did you run away and leave me all by myself on the way here~?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...Oh, you were here too?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> You didn't even recognize me!?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Hey, Hiyori-chan! Even if you're joking, you can't be that rude!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Uuuu, not just cute, but kind on top of that. You're my angel, Kanami-chan...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Eh-? U-Uh, thanks...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Anyway, since we worked up a sweat here, why don't we head for the baths! You've gotta come with us, Hiyori-san!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...I know you have an ulterior motive, so I'm not going anywhere with you.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> What's wrong with you, Hiyori-chan! Yui-chan just wants to hang out together; she doesn't have any ulterior motive!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> --Uh, yes I do?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> I mean, for me, taking a bath together after a mission is the best part about being a toji.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> ...Huh? What do you mean...? Wait, then what's your ulterior motive...?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Kanami. In this world, there exist perverts beyond human understanding. This is one of them.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> That's me, the pervert beyond human understanding~! Nice to meet you!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Wh-Why do you look so happy being called a pervert...? I don't get it...  </p><h2 id="2-yuis-little-sister" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>2: Yui's Little Sister</h2><p><strong>Ellen:</strong> Ah-! Yuiyui! I didn't think I'd run into you here!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Ellen-san! You're looking good again today!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Oh! Thank you so much!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I'm meeting Kaoru to get some parfaits from the coffee shop by the station. Do you want to join us, Yuiyui?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Ahh, sorry... I really want to go with you two, but my wallet's running tight this month...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Your wallet...?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> You are getting your salary, right? Since us toji are civil servants, after all.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Or did you spend it all on something big this month; is that what you mean?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> No... I get my salary, but it's not like that...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> ? Do you have some kind of special circumstances?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> .........I-I do...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> --Oh, sorry about that. If you don't want to talk about it, I don't want you to feel forced to.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> ...No, I don't want to have to hide this from you, so I'll tell you about it, Ellen-san.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> To tell the truth... My little sister has a serious illness, and the medical bills are really high...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> So... Um...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> It's hard getting by on just what my parents make, so whatever I get from my salary is gone right away too...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Sorry, you probably didn't expect me to bring up something so serious, did you...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I had no idea...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> It's my fault for prying into it. I'm sorry about that.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Don't blame yourself. You didn't do anything wrong.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> ...That settles it! In that case, forget about the coffee!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> We'll go to my room instead, and we can all hang out and talk!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I don't have a lot to offer, but I can make you some tea and sweets!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Ehh-!? You don't have to go that far; I'd feel bad if you changed your plans because of me.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Don't worry about a thing! I didn't know your sister was sick!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> But I think it's incredible the way you're already helping to support your family, Yuiyui!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> And also, I'm really glad you felt like sharing that with me!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> So I want to know more and more about you, so we can get even closer!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Ellen-san... Thanks a lot!!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> I want to get a lot closer with you too, Ellen-san!!  </p><h2 id="3-yuis-grades" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>3: Yui's Grades</h2><p><strong>Mirja:</strong> Final exams will be starting soon. Asakura Mihono, have you been preparing yourself?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Mirja-san... I've been thinking. I've been working hard as a toji, so I shouldn't really have to study, right?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> We carry the duties of both a civil servant and a student, so neglecting your studies is out of the question.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Uuuuuuuu... I thought I could get you on my side if I tried to pass it off as seriously asking for advice, but it's no use...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> By the way, what kind of grades do you get, Yui?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> My grades? Aside from math, they're catastrophically bad!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Really-! Thank goodness-! We're in this together-!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I don't know that that's something to be happy about...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> But hey, why are you only good at math then?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Mmm, well, I use math all the time doing everyday things, so I guess I just picked it up naturally?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Back when I was in elementary school, I liked finding the discount stickers they use in supermarkets. I'd do the math for the prices in my head, and I just got better and better at it.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Really? I like finding discounted stuff too, but I just bring them to the checkout without figuring out the price.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Math is useful, and it can really make life easier!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> For example, if you're at a festival stall and they ask if you want to try the raffle, you can judge the price against the theoretical value of the prizes left over and decide if you should draw or not!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Th-Theoretical...?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> To put it simply, it means calculating how much you stand to gain before deciding whether you should gamble.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Are you good at math too, Mirja-san?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I am. I like to think all the scientific subjects are my forte.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> You mean it!? If you're good at math too, it must really have been fate that brought us together!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I saw Mirja's test results before, and it's not just math. She gets good grades in every science subject...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> That doesn't change the fact that she's good at math though! The minor details don't matter here!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Let's cut right to the chase, Mirja-san! Why don't you come back to my room, and we can passionately talk about math alone together!?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I have the feeling I'm in danger, so I refuse.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Th-This can't be happening... I managed to ruin my big chance because of the way I'm always acting...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yui-chan... So you know how bad you act, huh...  </p><h2 id="4-protective-handkerchief" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>4: Protective Handkerchief</h2><p><strong>Mai:</strong> I've thought this for a while, but that handkerchief with the little chicks on it you always have on your arm is so cute, Yui-chan.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Thanks! Actually, my little sister, Miku, made it for me!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Wow, that's so nice! The stitching is so well done...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Ehehehe. Miku's been in the hospital ever since she was little, but she's really good at sewing~.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> She even left a message on it, "Onee-chan, thank you for everything"!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> You love your sister a lot, don't you, Yui-chan. Whenever you talk about her, your eyes light up.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Of course! She's my lovable little sister.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> ...Miku loves to study, so every time I go to her hospital room there's always piles of thick books lying around.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Every one of them is just words words words, with no pictures anywhere. I give up on the first page whenever I try reading one.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> ...I only heard this from the nurses, but Miku's dream is to someday be a schoolteacher.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Apparently, a few times a week, she gathers up the other kids who stay at the hospital like her and helps them with their studies.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> She sounds like such a good girl.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> And even though she's been hospitalized since she was young, she has all kinds of dreams for the future.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> ...If her sickness gets better, she'll study a lot, then get into a good college, and fulfill her dream of becoming a schoolteacher.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> And then she'll meet someone nice, get married, and become a good mother.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> --But, her sickness is taking all of that away from her.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> It's too unfair. Why'd that have to happen to such a good kid... If I could take her place, I would, but...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> ......<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Ah... Sorry! You were only asking about my handkerchief, but then all I could think about was Miku.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> You know, I think aradama and illness are a lot alike. They both come out of nowhere, and they both take the futures from people who've done nothing wrong.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> That's why I have to fight it!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> I might not be able to make Miku better, but I can save people getting unfairly attacked by aradama!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> To tell the truth, sometimes when I run into a big aradama, I feel so scared I want to run away.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> But when that happens, I look at the handkerchief Miku gave me. And I imagine Miku with me, telling me to do what's right!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Like, "Onee-chan, help save those people from the pain of losing their future".<br><strong>Yui:</strong> And then, all the people getting attacked by aradama look like Miku to me. And for Miku's sake, I'll fight off any aradama!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> All my fears vanish, and when I swing my okatana, I feel like I could chop through every aradama in my way, like, URYAAAAA!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Really? So to you, that handkerchief is the ultimate protective charm.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I'm sure your sister is also feeling better, knowing how hard you're working as a toji for her.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Ehehe, I hope so!  </p><h2 id="5-whats-always-in-my-bag" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>5: What's Always in My Bag</h2><p><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Ahh-! Practice's finally over-! Man, I'm starving now.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Kiyoka, you got anything to eat?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I don't. We at the last of my gummies this morning...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Kofuki-san! If you're hungry, I've got just the thing in my bag!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Like what?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Tadah-! It's tako wasabi!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> --Ehhh!?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Nn? What's wrong, Kiyoka-chan?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> W-Why did you have tako wasabi in your bag...?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Well of course, that's because if I ever feel like having some, I can pull it out right away!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> B-But you're supposed to keep it refrigerated, aren't you...?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> I keep an ice pack in there too, so it's nice and cold! Don't worry!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You keep an ice pack in your bag!? Just for the tako wasabi!?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Hang on, it's already evening. If you put that in there before we started practice, isn't it all melted by now?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I feel like there's bigger things to worry about than that, Kofuki-san...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> It's fine! When we went back, I swapped it out for a new one!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Well, fine by me.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You're okay with that...!?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> In the first place, why would you got that far to keep tako wasabi with you at all times...?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Do you really feel like you have to eat some that often...?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Nn? What's weird about that? You keep gummies in your bag too, Kiyoka.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Right? It's the same thing!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ehhhh...? Tako wasabi and gummies aren't at all alike though...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> But they feel the same in your mouth, don't they?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Even if they do, everything else is completely different, isn't it...?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Anyway, Kofuki-san! Please try the tako wasabi I made!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You made it yourself!?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Why's that surprise you? Mai gives out the cookies she makes all the time, doesn't she?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> She does, but making tako wasabi is on a whole different level from baking cookies...!?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Uuu... When it comes to food, I can't get through to these two at all... Hono-chan, Chie-san, Mirja-san, help me...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> --Ohh. This stuff's pretty good.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Isn't it! Here, you have some too, Kiyoka-chan!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Open wide and say ahh-!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...I-I'll just try one bite...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> (bite)<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...! It's good! The octopus is fun to chew, and the wasabi gives it a nice flavor.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I always thought of tako wasabi as something adults eat when they're drinking, but this is really tasty!!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> See-? Now do you get why I like to have tako wasabi with me when I'm out?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I do. Or at least, I can tell why you like it so much!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I've never really had it before, so I had no idea it tasted so good...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Fu fu fu. I'm happy to turn you into a tako wasabi fan too, Kiyoka-chan-!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> If you ever want some, come ask me anytime!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Okay, thanks for offering! Then... Could I have another bite?<br><div><iframe width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a6wLA2_IHTA"></iframe></div><br><strong>New Year's 1:</strong> To Fulfill a Great Ambition<br><strong>Yui:</strong> ...Pant, pant...

I just know you'd look great in a kimono...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Why aren't you wearing a kimonooo!!?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Cause putting one on's too annoying.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> But I've been waiting so long for this...

You look way too cute in that!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ehehe, thanks. Chii-nee helped put it on me.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Really, stop running around, Mihono-chan. What will you do if it starts coming loose?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ahh, oh yeah! Sorry, Chii-nee!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I think it would be best if you remembered how to put it on yourself, so you can fix it if that happens.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I-I can try, but... I'm not sure I can remember...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> ......<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> What is it, Yamashiro Yui?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Bravo-! Bravo, everyone! Could anyone else out there wear a kimono so well, nay, they couldn't!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> ...Wait, hold on? Where's Kiyoka-chan?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> She's still getting changed. She said she can't get it to fit right or something.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> She was still like that when we were done changing too.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> That's true. She said she might need a little more time.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Hmm... So that means, Kiyoka-chan's still getting dressed all alone right now...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> That's how it is.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Guhe, guhehe. My big chance has arrived. It's time to make my dream come true!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Your dream?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Yes, my dream! The humble Yamashiro Yui will go help Kiyoka-chan as she's getting changed!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Kiyoka and Yui are pretty close, huh. Maybe I should go help her too.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> She's not a little kid. One person's enough.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> But still, is it really alright letting her go?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> KI-YO-KA-CHWAAAN-!　I'M- HERE- TO- HELP-, WITH YOUR KIMONO!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> GYAAAAAAAAAAAA!!<br><strong>New Year's 2:</strong> It's Fine, Isn't It!<br>[This needs a TL note.

You're so adventurous, Tsugumi-san-!!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I am not. Besides, wouldn't it be boring going to the pool with someone like myself?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Seriously-! I don't get it; how could a date at the pool all alone with a cute girl ever be boring?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> It's impossible to predict what will set you off, Yamashiro-san.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> ...Will anyone else be coming?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Uhh, as far as I've heard, there's Kanami-chan, Mai-chan, Mihono-chan, Kiyoka-chan...<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> ...That's enough. I get the gist of it now.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> So anyway, come to the pool with us! Or, is there some research you have to do?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> No, on Sunday, I'll be available.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Hooray-! Be sure to get an extra cute swimsuit ready for it, okay-!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> What kind of swimsuit did you buy, Tsugumi-san?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Just an ordinary one.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Did you really get a swimsuit just for this!? I'm so glad to hear it!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> There's nothing wrong with having a swimsuit handy.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> How much swimming do you plan on doing, Yamashiro-san?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> You think we're going swimming!?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> No wait, since we're going to the pool together, we should have fun with each other!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> But, isn't the purpose of a pool facility to let you swim?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> That's what school pools are for. But we're here to enjoy the pool today!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Enjoy it? ...I see, that is another way of looking at it.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> That's right! And to that end, I, Yamashiro Yui! Have studied the pool to perfection!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> What I recommend trying at this pool we're going to is the floating island attraction, Tsugumi-san!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> The "floating island attraction"?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> That's right! It's an attraction featuring floating platforms in the pool that you try to cross over while dodging obstacles!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> They have water slides and stuff too, but that sounded like the most fun to me!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> So you should look forward to it, okay?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> It does sound like fun, doesn't it-.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Of course it does! I was getting so excited about it last night that I could barely sleep.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> From the sound of things, Kanami-chan and Mai-chan got there ahead of us, so we should race on over there too!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> I just can't calm down anymore~.

I will now explain the rules!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> The rules?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> The difficulty of this attraction is designed for normal people, but we're toji!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> That's why; don't you think we ought to make it more challenging?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> You have a point. If it's too easy, it won't be very fun.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> I knew you'd understand, Mai-chan!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> How exactly do you plan on making it more challenging though?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Are we going to cross it while doing a handstand?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> A handstand!?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Going upside down in swimsuits on the floating islands... Everybody's bodies wobbling around... Tsugumi-san, are you a genius...?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Hang on, wouldn't doing a handstand on it be dangerous? We have to set a good moral standard.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Ugh... If that's what your conscience as a toji says, then we'll just have to go along...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> So, like I originally planned, we'll cross the floating islands in pairs while holding each other's hands!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> We have to hold hands... That sounds like it would really restrict our movements.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Not to mention, if one person lost their balance, it would be easy for both to fall in.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> That should make for a nice adjustment to the difficulty, Yamashiro-san.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Sure it does; I racked my brain coming up with it. Tsugumi-san, you and I should be the first pair to go!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> ...This takes an even greater sense of balance than I realized... Whoops.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Watch out, Tsugumi-san! Come and lean your body into me!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Thanks for supporting me, Yamashiro-san.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> I should be the one thanking you hereee.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> (The perfectly legitimate reason I invented to press up against girls on the floating islands is a huge success!)<br><strong>Yui:</strong> (Ahh, this is bad. I'm enjoying this so much it hurts! I wish time could stop here forever!)<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Uhehe, uheheheheh!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> What's the matter, Yamashiro-san?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Nothing at all, just that the wonderfulness of the pool is getting to mee.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> True, I'm having a better time than I thought I would.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> ...Yamashiro-san, thank you for asking me to come with you.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Tsugumi-san smiled...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> (Wait? The mood here... If I confessed to her right now, doesn't it seem like she'd accept?)<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Tsugumi-san, I-- PHWAGH!?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> The water hoses have started up.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Did you really have to give me a cold shower nowwwwww!?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Yamashiro-san!?

It's so precious I can't get enough!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Only you could describe aradama management as precious, Yamashiro-san.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> The reason I do this is because, if there are no aradama around, Shichinosato-san starts to get cranky.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Oh come onnn, isn't that what makes it so precious~?

I realize it's a little late to ask, but, why are you helping with my research?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Putting it bluntly, I'm doing it for the money.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> I get to be together with a real beauty, and I get paid to do it. Working as a toji is seriously the best job there is!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Your expression was different before and after you said that... Was there something about it you found hard to tell me?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Ahaha, not at all; I love a girl who's perceptive like that.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> ...My little sister, she's sick. That's why I need as much money as I can get.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> But, don't you think a reason like that's sort of too heavy to bring up? I mean, when you're fooling around with girls, it's best to keep things a little lighthearted and all!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> She's sick?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Ahaha, I shouldn't have told you all that. Please just forget it.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> No, it's good that I was able to see a new side of you.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> And also, Yamashiro-san. The experiments you're assisting us with...

Research is progressing on whether or not noro can be used to cure diseases.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> In fact, there have been rumors of a successful test case...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> This research can... But, how does it work?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> It's only a rumor, so I'm not very clear on the details. At most, it should still only be at the fundamental research stage.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> But still! It's possible that it could save my sister... It might be able to save Miku, wouldn't it?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> ...Hearing something like that, there's no way I can sit still about it!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Then... You might want to go and ask the elite guard about it.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> The elite guard?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Yukari-sama herself is involved with this research, so the people in the elite guard may know something more.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Though, it's considered top secret, so I'm not sure if they will tell you...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> That's enough for me!

But, someone who knows a lot about that treatment told me I shouldn't place my faith in it...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> It's true that they say progress in the field of medical research is fierce going. However... Is that the only method that can cure your sister?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> No... It's going bit by bit, but she really is getting better now.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Is that research something that will soon be available for use?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Umm... I think they said, it was still at the stage of fundamental research?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Then, that well informed person was right in what they said. You can't be certain of when a medical treatment still in the stage of fundamental research will be made available.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> This is only in regards to new forms of medicine, but... I've heard new medicines can take over a decade of research before they are made for general use.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> It can take that long!?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> (If that's true, then... Going the slow and steady way might actually be faster...)<br><strong>Yui:</strong> (I can't be getting all torn up over it now; I've got to keep going at it the best I can, for Miku's sake!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Thanks a lot, Mirja-san! I'm past it now!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> The girls of the investigation team really are the best there is!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ...A crying child will soon be laughing, I suppose. Well, if you've recovered your spirit, then let's leave it at that.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Right! Yamashiro Yui's going at it in full spirit for another day!<br><div><iframe width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wuef7y1z6Q4"></iframe></div>  </p><h2 id="china---yui-start-the-chinatown-date-ive-longed-for" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[China - Yui: Start]: The Chinatown Date I've Longed For!?</h2><p><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> We've safely eliminated the aradama, so while we're here, why don't we take a stroll around Chinatown until the sun starts setting?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I'm all for it~! There's still a lot more shops I haven't been to yet. Do you two wanna come with me?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Of course I do!　It's a Chinatown date with two good looking girls at my side! This makes fighting off those aradama all worth it~.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Date~! Date~! Chinatown date~!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> You're sure in a good mood, Yui.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> You know I am! Taking a beauty like you on a date through Chinatown; that's the kind of classic date course I've been dreaming of!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> ...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Hm? What's up, Tsugumi-san? Ah-- Don't tell me, you're getting jealous I'm giving Mihono-chan all the attention?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> No, not once this whole time have I ever felt anything like that...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Then, what's that uneasy look on your face for?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Sorry, it might be senseless of me to ask, but... I was just wondering, what is the definition of a "date" to begin with?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Tsugumi-san, you're such a serious going girl. When it comes to things like this, it's all about "Don't think; feel!"<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Go with your feelings without thinking... Is that it. Then, coming up with feelings regarding dating... How exactly do you do that?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> That's easy! Right now, I'll swap between taking you and Mihono-chan on a Chinatown date with me, to give you the dating experience!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> The dating experience?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Yeah! I've spent a lot of time mentally rehearsing for the ultimate heart-pounding Chinatown date, so I'll show you a good time for sure!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> If you're that sure then, Yamashiro-san... It might not be so bad to get an experience of the real thing.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> That's the spirit! So then, to start us off... I think I'll take out Mihono-chan!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ehh-- Starting with me!? If you just tell me we're going on a date like that, I don't have time to get my heart ready...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Don't you worry about that, Honey. I'll escort you around just right. Why don't we find somewhere to get some delicious sweets first?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> This place sells the apricot seed soft serve that's the talk of Chinatown! I don't have much pocket money on me today, so let's share one between us. Here, open wide.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ahhn. [chew chew]... It's yummy-!!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Alright, now it's your turn, Mihono-chan! I'll say "ahh", and you...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah, look, look! In that general store next door! They've got cute panda things you can wear!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Ah, wait, Mihono-chaaan!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Tadahhh! Check it out! See this panda hat I got! Does it look good?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Mmm~! It's good; so good~! Next up, let's try this Chinese hat~! Uwah~! This one looks good too~.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> ...<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Um, would it be alright if we stopped for a moment?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Hmmm? What's the matter, Tsugumi-san? Hahahn~, now are you feeling jealous of me with Mihono-chan...<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> That's not it. It's just that, I've started to have my doubts about all this. Eating sweets together, and excitedly shopping. It's true that it does seem like you two are having lots of fun, but...<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> It also seems as if nothing has changed from when the three of us were going around together before. Can you really call this an example of a date...?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> You're right. It was a lot of fun, but if I had to say either way, this isn't any different from everyone hanging out together, is it-?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Yamashiro-san, is it really fine to classify this under the definition of a date?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Uuu~, when you put it like that, I'm losing confidence. Could I have a little time to think this over?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Get ahold of yourself, Yui. Remember the strongest Chinatown fantasy date plan you fantasized about over and over day after day. Chinatown... Chinatown... When I think of an ideal date in Chinatown, it's gotta be...  </p><h2 id="china---yui-end-a-practice-run-yuis-fantasy-chinatown-date" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[China - Yui: End]: A Practice Run!? Yui's Fantasy Chinatown Date!</h2><p><strong>Yui:</strong> Chinatown date... Chinatown date... When I think of situations for the Chinatown date I've been dreaming of, there's...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> That'll do~!!!!!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> You look like a lightbulb went off in your head, Yui.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> She does. And, it's somewhat unsettling...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Anyway, let's get back into it, and swap partners! I'll need you to be play my girlfriend now, Tsugumi-san!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> (Sigh, of course it would come to this. Though, I was the one who asked what a date was to start, so I can't back out now, can I...)<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Understood. Then, please go easy on me.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Just leave that to me! Anyway, let's start right off by holding hands! [squeeze~]. Woww, Tsugumi-san, your hands are so soft and warm~!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Y-Yamashiro-san! What are you doing? You got too close all of a sudden!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> See, I remembered. When you think of a date, it means the two of you are closer than friends! That means, the two of us need to have a closeness deeper than friendship.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Deeper than friendship... Is that so.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> That's right! For example, if, while everyone's watching, I gave you a deep kiss!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> And then, and then, if I took you someplace where no one's around, like a park or back alley, and when it's just the two of us, we... Ehehe... Ehehe...<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I-Is that what it means...  I think I understand the gist of it now, so don't you think we can end our fake date here?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Y-Yeah. I think so too... The sun's going to go down soon too, so why don't we head home for today...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Ehh-, just hang on! We were only just getting started-!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Uuuu... Just when it was looking like we were going to get into the juicy stuff; I'm such an idiot! I should have way more stuff in my stock of fantasies that'll make girl's hearts pound-!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Ah-! I know! I have the strongest Chinatown date plan in history here! Hey, you two-, wait for me-!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> I thought up the strongest Chinatown date plan! So please! Will you at least hear me walk you through it? If this doesn't make your hearts throb, then I'll take this as my loss!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> We weren't competing to see if you won or lost in the first place... But, if you're that adamant about it, we can at least hear you out.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah. It's fine if you're only going to talk... And plus, I'm a little curious what the strongest date plan is like!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Thanks so much, you two! It's that kind side of you that I love so much! Anyway, I'll get right to my presentation!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Our date starts off at a China dress shop in Chinatown! We put on matching dresses, and head out on the town!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Matching China dresses... We're sticking to the assumption that this is a same sex female couple then...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Still, this sounds exciting! You'd be happy to wear a cute dress, wouldn't you!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Right? So then, we eat some tasty food in Chinatown, and have a good time going around to all the cute general stores...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> That'd be fun~! But...<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Things have gone back to playing out exactly the same as before, haven't they...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Hold your horses-! The main event starts right here!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> While the two of us are having a good time on our date, a group of burly thugs shows up and surrounds us, then tells you this:<br><strong>Yui:</strong> "Hey, pretty little thing, want to come have a good time with us..."<br><strong>Yui:</strong> That's when the thugs try to take you away by force. But then, I shout, "Get your hands off my girlfriend-!" and give the guys a high kick while I'm still in my China dress!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> To protect the girl I love, I start pumping out stylish moves, taking down the punks one after another. And, completely captivated by me, my girlfriend says:<br><strong>Yui:</strong> "Thank you! I owe you my life. To make it up to you... You. Can. Have. Me..."<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Kyaa-! Y'know, you're a lot bolder than I thought... But, what kind of woman turns down a woman's advances! Now's not the time to hold ourselves back! And then, the two of us spend our sweet time together... Eheheheh...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> So, what do you think? Don't you want to go on a date like that?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ummm... I want to wear a China dress, but... Everything after that is a little...<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> To begin with, it's hard to imagine such a convenient group of thugs would appear at such convenient timing...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Come onnn... But I came up with the strongest, most exciting Chinatown fantasy date plan in history...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Wawah, Yui's all depressed now...<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> If we were to leave her like this, it would weigh on our conscience, wouldn't it. We have to come up with something to support her...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yui, I think everybody has their own different kind of date they dream about, but I got to have a lot of fun today because you were with us! So thanks.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> That's right. And, I was able to mostly understand what the definition of a date is too...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> You mean it!? I'm so glad~! I should be the one thanking you two! Getting to go on a three girl date through Chinatown made me the happiest girl in the world!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> A three girl date...? Can you really call an outing with three people a date? Sigh... I'm understanding the definition less and less.<br><div><iframe width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mM0jQ11E1pE"></iframe></div>  </p><h2 id="pirate---yui-start-after-the-mission-were-pirates" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Pirate - Yui: Start]: After the Mission, We're Pirates!</h2><p><strong>Aradama:</strong> GGGII...!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> --YAAH!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Great work as always, Ellen-san!

Please, for our sakes, don't encourage Yui-chan too much...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> It would be a good idea though, if you didn't have to worry about Yuiyui's own health and safety. But there wouldn't be any time for Yuiyui herself to rest.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Keeping an eye on good looking girls would fill me up with power, so I think it has a chance to work!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> There isn't one, okay? You don't have a chance.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> You don't miss a beat playing off each other. It's perfect.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Kiyoka~, Yui~, Ellen-saaan~!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Hono-chan? Are you done over there too?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah! Akira-san was with me and all. And Satsuki-san knew just where the aradama would be going, so it made fighting easy.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> --But hey, that wasn't what I wanted to talk about. The person in charge of the amusement park asked, after we're done clearing out the aradama, if we wanted to play around in the park a little!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> And also, with this new attraction they just started!
