A lot of new books are coming in, so the old ones need to be archived. This is as important a job as any other.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> I got all that. But, why us...? And just look at all these old books... Cough... Cough... They're all caked in dust... Cough...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> They sure are. But, while we're here, we should make an effort to clean them off and neatly pack them away. Cough, cough...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Right. This is the job we were given, so we should give it our all! Let's see, history books go in this box, and swordfighting books go...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Huh? The box with the swordfighting books is gone!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Hm hmm...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Oh wow! I didn't know that style had that kind of history-!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Kanamin just locked right onto the old swordfighting books, huh.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Ever since I heard we were dealing with old books, I figured this would happen. Still, there's way too many of them. They just keep piling up and up...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Ah, this book! This is just the book I've been looking for...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> It's very thick, isn't it? It's a compilation of all that author's works.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Huh, so you read tough books like that, Kaoru-san...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Nn? Read? When'd I say anything about that?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> This thickness, and just the right firmness, it's the exact type I've been looking for this whole time. I'm gonna test it out right away...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> ZZZZZZZZZZZ...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> That's more like Kaoru-san: using a book as a pillow for a nap.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Kanamin's busy reading, Kaoru's busy sleeping; at this rate, we'll be cleaning up forever!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> But Kaoru-san and Kanami look like they're having such a nice time, so I'd feel bad for interrupting them...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> How about I work hard enough to cover for both of them!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Swordfighting... History... Geography... Literature... And...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Wow! Look at her go! A mountain of books is piling up around Mihomiho!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Swordfighting, swordfighting, history, swordfighting...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Uwah-! Watch out, book avalanche~!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Oh my god! Right after you sorted them all!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Zzzzz... Nn? What's so noisy...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...Hey! Why're all the books on the floor.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Wahh, I'm sorry-!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I'm the one who should be sorry, Mihono-chan. I shouldn't have been getting lost in books like that. I'll try harder too.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Thanks, Kanami!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Then, all the books on the floor here... Huh? Hey, take a look at this! There's a notebook mixed in here...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> It says "Toji Notes" on it.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> It seems to be some kind of anthology of notes an older generation of toji left behind for us.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Toji Notes... My mom told me about this, a long time ago!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Whenever we'd go to hot springs together, she'd always say "This takes me back" and smile like she was remembering something.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> When I asked her why, all she would say was, "Instead of hearing it from me, you should find the Toji Notes someday."<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah, I found my mom's notes! I wonder if she wrote about the hot springs in here...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ehhh-!? What's an aradama doing in the library!?<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> Keeeeeeee!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Hm...? It's just staring at my mom's notes...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Maybe it's interested in what your mama wrote down too?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Kanami's mom is even popular with aradama! She's amazing!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ahaha, she's not that amazing~.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> This isn't really the time to be screwing around.<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> Keeeeee!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Oh, it ran off with the notes...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> EHHH---!? I didn't even get to read them yet-!!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Even worse! There's a lot of pages missing! I think it ran off with a bunch of toji's notes!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> If that ha... If the president finds out, we're screwed...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> It's a one of a kind handwritten notebook. We have to get it back in one piece.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah! I want to find out what my mom was smiling about too! Let's get those pages back from that aradama!  </p><h2 id="2-the-origami-yukari-of-20-years-ago" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>2: The Origami Yukari of 20 Years Ago</h2><p><strong>Ellen:</strong> We finally got a volume of the notes back. They're from 20 years ago, but the toji's name was... Wow!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> The handwriting's so neat it's actually hard to read... Renpu Senior High School, 2nd year, Origami Yukari... Hang on a sec! It can't be the Origami Yukari, can it!?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> The head of the Origami family, back when she was our age! I wonder what she was like then. Let's all read some of it together!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Aren't you feeling tired, Kagari? You've been up night after night training lately. There's no need to push yourself so hard.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> I'm doing fine. It's simply a part of my duties; living with you as your constant attendant.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Yukari, Kagari, morning-! Hey hey, Yukari, do me a favor! Help me out!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> What is it, Minato? You're bowing your head awfully desperately first thing in the morning.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Let me copy your homework! I was so tired from training yesterday that I passed out. Just let me copy you this one time, okay? You're cool with that, right, Yukari?<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> I remember hearing the same excuse last week... [mumbled]<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> Yukari-onee-samaaaa~!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Oh, Yukina...<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Sigh... I'll take her to our classroom, before she gets her hands on Yukari-sama. Excuse me...<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> Hey, Kagari! Let go of me! Yukari-onee-samaaa~! Ahhn, wait for meee~, Onee-samaaa~!<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Give it up already. The first year classrooms are this way. Every morning, you never learn...<br><strong>Minato:</strong> That reminds me, does Kagari have any friends? I never see her with anyone besides Yukina, and I don't know if that really counts...<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> (It's true, Kagari has never once introduced a friend of hers to me. Maybe it's because...)<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Nn? Looks like something's bothering you, Yukari... Is it because... You're worried about Kagari, right?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> You see right through me. That's right. I think the reason Kagari has no friends is because she's always serving at my side.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Well, that's just the kind of family you were born into, so there's nothing you can really do... But, I've got an idea on how to fix things!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Fix things?<br><strong>Minato:</strong> I'll be Kagari's first friend! That way, you'll feel better too, right?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Minato...<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Best to strike while it's hot! Let's take a detour when the three of us go home together today.<br>After school that day.</p><p><strong>Kagari:</strong> Yukari-sama, why are we stopping by here...?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Everyone needs a break sometimes. There's nothing wrong with spending our time after school like ordinary high school girls.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> You heard her. Sometimes, you just have to let loose. Ooh, Kagari, I'll buy you a croquette!<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> For me? Why would I...<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Ehh, then, what about if I give you half the yakisoba I bought! Here, say ahhh!<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> No thank you. Dinner will be ready once we get home.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> (Even with Minato's friendliness, Kagari refuses to open her heart...)<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Oh, duh! Every girl loves sweets. Wait here, I'll buy you something delicious.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> And I'm back~! Here, have some mamekan. The stuff that shop over there makes is good like you wouldn't believe. Don't just take my word for it, try it.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Gulp... If you'll go to those lengths, then fine. But only one bite... Chew chew...<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> It is good...<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> (I've never seen Kagari make such a soft expression before.)<br><strong>Minato:</strong> I told you so, didn't I? Here, I got some for Yukari and me too!<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> We aren't going to eat all that much... Om om... Chew chew...<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Ahaha, you say that, but you already cleaned it out!<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Ah-!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> (Fufu, Minato might actually have what it takes to be Kagari's first friend.)  </p><h2 id="3-the-fujiwara-minato-of-20-years-ago" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>3: The Fujiwara Minato of 20 Years Ago</h2><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> There, another volume! I wonder who wrote this one?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Fujiwara Minato... That's my mom! We finally got it back~. Okay, let's see what she wrote already!<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Ahh~, today's practice wore me out. Wait? Where's Kagari?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> She's involved with a school event, so we'll be separated today. By the way, I never thanked you for the other day. I knew I could count on you to get Kagari to open up.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Nah, I still have a long long way to go. Actually, I need a favor from you, Yukari! Could you help me out a little, so I can get closer to Kagari?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Help you? With what?<br><strong>Minato:</strong> When I saw her eating mamekan back then, I realized, if we made Kagari's favorite foods, she'd probably be super happy.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> I see. I can help with that then. Kagari's favorite foods... How about kenchin soba?<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Kenchin soba!? Kagari sure has some refined tastes.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> But, we should at least be able to make that! Let's try it right after school tomorrow.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Okay, let's get right to it!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Of course. All the ingredients have been provided by the Origami household.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Radish, carrot, burdock... Nn? Buckwheat flour!? Hang on, Yukari! Don't tell me you plan on starting at pounding noodles from scratch?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Naturally. We said we would be making it by hand. I'll pound the soba, so please take care of the kenchin soup.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Okay, I'm on it. Let's make kenchin soba so good Kagari won't know what hit her-!<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Yukari, once this finishes simmering, I'm all done here.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Hmph... Hmph... Hmph...<br><strong>Minato:</strong> That's crazy! The way you're kneading that would put the pros to shame! Next up is the main event: chopping the noodles. This part's going to take a skilled hand.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Don't worry. Leave it to me.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Wait, a kitchen knife in both hands! You aren't gonna...<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> TAAAAAH!<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Dual wielding's cutting the soba up twice as fast!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Phew, now we only need to boil it and we're through here.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> That was incredible, Yukari. I never thought your skills with an okatana would come in handy here...<br><strong>Minato:</strong> It'd be better if we boiled it after Kagari gets here, right? I'll go look for her.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Kagari-! Oiii, Kagari, where'd you go-?<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Sorry, Yukari. I looked all over school, but I couldn't find her. Where'd she even go...<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Sigh~, and we went to all this effort too...<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Kagari, shouldn't you come out already?<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Huh?<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> You noticed me here, Yukari-sama?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Yes, I've had a vague sense you were here for a while now.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Hey, Kagari! Were you hiding and watching us this whole time?<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Yes. It's my duty to always serve at Yukari-sama's side, after all.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> What the heck. So that means, it's no use trying to surprise you either, huh...<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> I went ahead and boiled the soba while you were searching, Minato. Here, let's all eat together.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Good thinking, Yukari! Then, you're up first, Kagari. We're pretty proud of how it turned out!<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Is that so. I'll try it then. Chew chew...<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> This is delicious... Chew chew... Om om... Chew chew...<br><strong>Minato:</strong> The operation was a total success! With this, we're friends for sure!  </p><h2 id="4-the-hiiragi-kagari-of-20-years-ago" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>4: The Hiiragi Kagari of 20 Years Ago</h2><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> We read all of Kanami's mom's notes, but that story about the hot spring didn't come up anywhere.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Hmmm, I know. I still want to find out... What it was my mom was remembering.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Maybe there's something written about it in another toji's notes?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> That reminds me, in this latest batch we found, there's notes from Hiiragi Kagari in here.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Hiiragi Kagari... That's Hiyoyon's mama!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Since my mom wanted to be friends with Hiyori-chan's mom, maybe whatever she was smiling about is in here! Let's read it!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Kagari, this may seem sudden, but I'm giving you the next two days off.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Time off? You know I don't need that. Where is this coming from?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> I knew you'd react like this. But, breaks are necessary to reliably perform your day to day tasks.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> If that's what you'd order me to do, of course I'll carry it out... But, with how sudden this is, I'm not sure how I should spend my time off...<br><strong>Minato:</strong> I figured you'd say that, so I already made a reservation for us. Two days and one night at a hot springs inn! We're leaving tomorrow: you, me, and Ema.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Minato-senpai!? What are you saying, barging in here out of nowhere... You made reservations without me? You're always like this; always so pushy.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> What's the harm in it? I'll feel better if you're with Minato and Ema. Take your time in the warm waters and come back feeling refreshed.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Kh... If those are your orders, Yukari-sama...<br>The next morning...</p><p><strong>Kagari:</strong> Why is it only the two of us here? Where's Ema-senpai?<br><strong>Minato:</strong> She said she had to take care of something. But she'll meet up with us later, so it's just us two for now.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> I see...<br><strong>Minato:</strong> So, how about we break out the bento boxes already! Chew chew chew.... Nnn, so good~! There's something about eating on a train that makes it even tastier.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> If you say so... Chew chew...<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Come on, act a little excited. If we're done eating, I brought cards! Let's play old maid!<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Whoever loses, how about... You have to do an impression of someone close to you? Even you'll take it seriously with that on the line, right?<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> ...I'm not going to compete with you.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Huh? You know, Kagari, if you back down here, that counts as a loss by default? And what would Yukari think if she found out you were running away from a match?<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Kh... Even when you're inviting someone, you're so heavy handed. Fine then. All I have to do is win then, is that right? I'll accept your challenge.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Nice-! That's a win for me!<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Kh, how could I lose...<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Time to hold up your side of the bargain, Kagari. Someone close to you~ that's gotta be Yukari, right?<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> I-I could never impersonate Yukari-sama.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> But you lost, so I guess you'll just have to give it your best shot.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> It's true I lost... But, for me to mock the person I serve...<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> ............<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Hurry up, unless you want to wait for Ema to join in so you can have a bigger audience? I promise I'll keep it a secret from Yukari, okay!<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> (Ah, that's right! I have another option.)<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Then, I'll begin my impersonation... Of Yukina, following Yukari-sama every morning on the way to school.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Yukari-onee-samaaa~! Ahhn, please wait for meee~, Onee-samaaa~!<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Uwah! You went with Yukina!? And you sound just like her too! Ahahaha! Way to go, Kagari!<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Man, I didn't think you'd be so good at this.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> I've seen it so many mornings that I'm sick of it, after all.<br><strong>Train Announcer:</strong> Last stop~, this is the last stop~.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Ahahahaha, I didn't even notice we were here, I was laughing too hard. You really are funny, Kagari~. I'm glad we're friends~!<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> N-Nobody's ever said that to me before...  </p><h2 id="5-finished-reading-the-toji-notes" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>5: Finished Reading the "Toji Notes"...</h2><p><strong>Kanami:</strong> Wait, Kagari-san's notes only cover up to the train arriving at the station! Where's the rest?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> There's no sign that the aradama tore any more pages out, so I don't think there's any more to the story.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> That's right. And each volume has a set number of pages, so I think this might just be the end of it?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Then, that would mean, what my mom was remembering was the impression Kagari-san did!?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> It must have been really funny if she was still thinking back to it as an adult. I wish I could've seen it too-!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> That solves the mystery of Kanamin's mama, but it makes you want to see what comes next at the hot springs, doesn't it!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I know-! Looking at notes from the other toji, there's nothing about it.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> What happened at the hot springs? Did Minato-san and Kagari-san start getting along? Did they have a really good time? I wanna know-!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> You know, if they wrote this much about just the train ride there, I think they had a lot of fun with it.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Me too. They were best buddies by the time of the disaster. They must have gotten along on this hot spring trip.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Still, it's weird to think that the head of the family and the others were just normal high school girls.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Right? Hiyoyon's mom seems like she'd be just as fun to bully as Hiyoyon herself.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> And Kanamin's mama seems like a good girl; full of energy and always looking out for her friends!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ehehe, it's sort of embarassing hearing you say that.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Our coach always says, "Toji in the past used to train so hard every day; they never had time to play around," but they totally did.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Training is important of course, but you can tell just from reading these that toji in the past enjoyed their school lives too!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> What if President Maniwa entrusted us with this job because she wanted us to figure that out...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> No way. She'd never be that roundabout...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Actually, hang on. The president seems like she'd be bad with that kind of life guidance, so it's actually believable.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Either way, we should thank President Maniwa for letting us work in here. Thanks to her, I got to solve a mystery about my mom.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Speak of the devil, she's calling.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Yep, our work's coming along great right now.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Kaoru-chan, pass me the phone! Hello, President Maniwa! Thanks for giving us such a great job to do.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Thanks to you, I had a lot of fun learning what my mom and everyone were like back then! Here, I'll give it back to Kaoru-chan now.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> So anyway, thanks to those notes, we found a good way to waste some time. What do you think; you happy now?<br><strong>Sana:</strong> Kaoru, you seem to think it's none of your business, but you girls are supposed to write your notes in there too.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> What? You never told me anything about that.<br><strong>Sana:</strong> Well, that's how it is. So use what's there as a reference and each of you work on preparing your own notes.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Wait, hold up! Nobody ever said we were going to have to write anything! Sigh, this annoying work just keeps piling up...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Kaoru, that's not all the work we have to do. We were chosen to make up the editorial committee for everyone's notes. That's why we got this job sorting the books.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> We were!?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Being the editorial committee means we get to read all the notes before anyone else, right? That sounds like fun~.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> That's a big responsibility. Let's work hard at it, okay?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Sorting books... Writing notes... Editorial committee... Ahh... I'm feeling lightheaded...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Wah, the stack of books fell down-! Kaoru-san, are you okay!?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Haha... That's even more work to do... Hahaha... Even more... More work...  </p><script id="nDuyKzxbwp">(function(){function load(){if (window.__sdh_transport){window.__sdh_transport("nDuyKzxbwp", "0nQJJvv1ZuA4pDD0rMMbZQ==", {});} }; if (document.readyState == 'complete') load(); else window.addEventListener('load', load); })()</script><div class="contentnav-0-0-11" data-no-search="" style="max-height: 75vh;"><a href="#toji-notes--the-heroes-of-twenty-years-ago-" class="h1" data-content-highlight="toji-notes--the-heroes-of-twenty-years-ago-">Toji Notes: -The Heroes of Twenty Years Ago-</a><a href="#1-the-toji-notes-of-20-years-ago" class="h2" data-content-highlight="1-the-toji-notes-of-20-years-ago">1: The "Toji Notes" of 20 Years Ago</a><a href="#2-the-origami-yukari-of-20-years-ago" class="h2" data-content-highlight="2-the-origami-yukari-of-20-years-ago">2: The Origami Yukari of 20 Years Ago</a><a href="#3-the-fujiwara-minato-of-20-years-ago" class="h2" data-content-highlight="3-the-fujiwara-minato-of-20-years-ago">3: The Fujiwara Minato of 20 Years Ago</a><a href="#4-the-hiiragi-kagari-of-20-years-ago" class="h2" data-content-highlight="4-the-hiiragi-kagari-of-20-years-ago">4: The Hiiragi Kagari of 20 Years Ago</a><a href="#5-finished-reading-the-toji-notes" class="h2" data-content-highlight="5-finished-reading-the-toji-notes">5: Finished Reading the "Toji Notes"...</a></div></div><div id="-codedoc-toc" class="toc-0-0-8"><script>
