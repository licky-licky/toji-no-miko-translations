I could really go for some ice cream...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...If you're dying to eat it, I don't mind joining you.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Mm... I don't think I'll die, so let's just pass.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Eh...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ahaha, just kidding! Let's go!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> By the way, do you like any flavors besides chocomint, Hiyori-chan?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> I've never thought about it.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Then, wanna taste some of what I'm ordering?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Excuse me! I'll have a triple scoop with strawberry, cheesecake, and cream soda flavor!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> I'll have a triple as well. Make all three chocolate mint.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> You always take it to the extremes... Here, Hiyori-chan. Try this.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Mm... This cream soda flavor is actually good.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Can I have some of the strawberry and cheesecake too?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Go ahead.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> This one, it's good too. Mixing cheesecake and ice cream sounded like heresy, but this is actually a real winner.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I know, right?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...By the way, Kanami. Why are you aiming your phone at me?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Welll, you just looked so cute eating ice cream that I wanted to take a video of it.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> --Huh!?  
<strong>Kanami:</strong> When you smile like that, it looks like your face is melting. And now, that smile's all mine~.  
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ---!? Stop messing around!! Delete that right now!!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ehehe, no way~. I bet if I uploaded it to a video site, I'd get tons of likes too!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Don't do that!!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> For the title, how about... "Black Haired Beauty Caught on Hidden Camera Eating Ice Cream"?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...Fine. If that's how you're going to be, I'll eat all of your ice cream!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ahhh! My ice cream!

I was re-reading my favorite book, but I can't remember where I left it...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> The only place I haven't looked yet... Is this classroom...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah, someone's in there...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> (If I remember right, that's the third year, Juujou-senpai...? She always seems so hard to approach... I wonder what she's reading...)<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> (Ahh! That's my book! Why is Juujou-senpai reading it though... Wh-What should I do...)<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> (Actually, I want to know what she thinks of it... But it's no ordinary love story, so I'd be embarrassed if she kept reading...)<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> (Two teenage girls share such a lovely bond, but they have to fight against the destiny their parents left them, and things start heating up... I really recommend it...!)  
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ......<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> (S-So what does she think of it... I love that book so much, but... Ahh, if only I had a little more confidence...)<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> (? Huh...?)<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ......sniffle...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> (S-She's crying...! Juujou-senpai is crying...!?)<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ! Who's there?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Hya! S-S-S-S-Sorry! I didn't mean to spy on you...!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I just came to get back the book I left behind...!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...This is your book? Sorry for reading it.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> D-Don't worry about it! Do you like reading?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> I don't normally read many books, but... This was interesting. I suddenly found myself getting sucked into it.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Th-Then, I'll... I'll lend it to you! Please read it to the end!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> No, I couldn't...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I don't know any other girls who've read that book! I want to talk about it with someone! So please, read it!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ......<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah, sorry...! I'm imposing on you too much, aren't I...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> If you insist, then I'll borrow it.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ! Th-Thank you so much!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> What's your name?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I'm Musumi, in my second year. And you're Juujou-senpai, aren't you? You're participating in the upcoming tournament...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...Right. I'll be sure to give this back to you before then.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> No, you don't have to rush yourself.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> I'm in a hurry.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...After the tournament's over, I'd like it if you could recommend some books for me.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> S-Sure! I'd love to!  </p><h2 id="3-hiyoris-long-held-desire" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>3: Hiyori's Long Held Desire</h2><p><strong>Bodyguard Toji:</strong> There they are! The ones who attacked the head of the family! Just make this easy and surrender!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Tch. They caught up to us.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> But if we just beat these guards, we should be able to get away!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...Do you really plan on fighting beside me? You'll make yourself an enemy of everyone.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I made up my mind to run away with you!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...Then I hope you don't regret this.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> ...Phew. Since we've made it this far, we should be safe for a while.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ......<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Hm? What's wrong, Hiyori-chan? You keep staring at me.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...No, it's nothing.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Okay.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...Why aren't you asking me any questions?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> ...I can tell there's a strong determination behind your sword. A desire that won't let up until you reach your goal.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> No matter what your reason is, I've made up my mind to help you. You can share the rest with me when you feel ready.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...Oh.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...Then I'll tell you why... The reason why I'm after Origami Yukari.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Okay...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> You know about the great aradama incident, "The Great Disaster of Sagami Bay", that happened 20 years ago, don't you?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> They said it's the worst aradama incident in history. Origami Yukari-sama led a special force of the current presidents of the Five Traditions into Enoshima to suppress it.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> That's right.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> But to say they suppressed it was a lie. Origami Yukari, who they called a hero...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Is nothing more than the great aradama they claimed to have destroyed.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> The disaster that threatened the world. That despicable being. An utter stain on humanity. That's what she is.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Huh...!?  
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> My mother was one of the toji there at Enoshima. She should have had the power to destroy it, but she failed.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Now that aradama lives on, pretending to be Origami Yukari.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> My mother's power as a toji faded, and I watched her waste away over the years. And, last year, as I stayed by her side, she passed on.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...The night my mother died, I swore I would finish the duty she left undone.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...Well?

She's been looking upset for a while now...<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...... "Eternally flat chested woman"...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> No matter how I think about it, it seems like it has to be an insult...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> But I'd never thought of there being some kind of value related to chest size before. Is it really that bad mine are this small...?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> In the first place, Kaoru herself is older than me, but she doesn't seem any better...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Considering that, I don't think my flatness is too strange...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...... .........!?  
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Ellen must be some kind of special case... The difference in size is too disturbing...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...That's actually somewhat relieving. There's no way she can be considered the standard.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> No... Wait, that reminds me...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> I hadn't considered her until now, but Mai and Ellen together make a convincing argument...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> And Mai is even younger than I am...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Is that it? Does this mean my chest should have been at least that size by now...!?  
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> And... What rule defines how large they are to begin with...!?  
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> What do Kaoru and I lack...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> What do Ellen and Mai have...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ......Cheerfulness...? Kindness...?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Is their size a symbol representing the depths of a person's generosity...!?  
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ......<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ! Kanami! That's right, I still have Kanami!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> She's fairly cheery and considerate. Much more than Kaoru and I at least; more on Mai and Ellen's level!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> But her chest...!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> It seems like there's no relationship between chest size and human nature after all. Fufu... It's simply individual differences.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> ......What's wrong with her?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> She's been staring hard at everyone's boobs. But her face suddenly lit up when she settled on Kanamin's!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Hiyoyon really loves Kanamin, after all!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Boobs? ...Hehee. So that's what this is about.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Kukuku...

I already knew about Mai-chan, but I didn't think you were so good at studying too...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> You're both such strong toji, so don't you think it's unfair you get good grades too?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Shut up. I bet you only think about swordfighting in the middle of lectures. You should pay more attention.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Wait, how'd you know? Did you peek in one day!?  
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Sigh... We're getting sidetracked, so just forget it.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> In the time we've wasted now, you could have finished at least one page. Work on catching up.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Fiiine...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ......<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> ......<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> ...... (Peek).<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> It's such a nice day outside too... Hey, Hiyori-chan, after this is over, want to have a practice bat-<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...Are you actually bored already? It hasn't even been a full minute.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> S-Sorry... I'll study.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> ......<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> ......! ......~!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> (She's finally quieted down. I started doubting her ability to concentrate, but it looks like she's resigned to take this seriously...)<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Hey, what are you doodling in your textbook for!?  
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Because, I feel like I could come up with a better method than the one they're teaching in here.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> See, look~ With the stance they're teaching, you lose awareness around here~ But... How about this!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> The tactics in there have been tested countless times through history. You won't just come up with something better like that...<br><em>Hiyori leans over</em></p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Hm? Actually... This might work too...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Right!?

Ah, what about...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Rather than that, you could...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ......Ah!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Hey! Now you're getting me distracted too!!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Calm down, Hiyori-chan. Even if you slack off here, you'll still get good grades.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> What's with that condescending attitude!? In the first place, you're the one who asked me to help you study for your test!<br><strong>Mai (who was here the whole time):</strong> Fufu... You're actually pretty good at taking care of people, aren't you, Hiyori-chan?<br><em>Hiyori leans over to Mai</em></p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Hey, Mai! Isn't she your responsibility!? Don't laugh like it's my problem; help me out with her!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Hmmm, I don't know about that? Lately, it feels more and more like you're the one on Kanami-chan duty...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> And I'm busy with my own studying too. Take good care of Kanami-chan for me, Hiyori-chan~.  
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> M-Mai...? That smile of yours looks strangely forced... Are you mad about something...?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I'm not mad. Maybe just a little jealous.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Huh...!?

Sure, you can look forward to it!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...Sorry, I didn't mean to raise my voice just now.<br><strong>Karin:</strong> Hiyori... You love chocolate mint a lot, don't you.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> I-I won't deny that. Anyway, let's go look for the rest of the aradama.<br><strong>Karin:</strong> This one is a bit bigger and more of a handful... But, with Hiyori and I, we can manage!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> --This is the finish!<br><strong>Karin:</strong> Was that the last one?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Yeah. We finished suppressing the aradama sooner than scheduled. Thanks; it's because I had your help.<br><strong>Karin:</strong> It wasn't any trouble for me to come along.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> This one's only chocolate mint flavor convenience store ice cream, but it's pretty good.<br><strong>Karin:</strong> I'll have some then. ...Nn!<br><strong>Karin:</strong> No wonder you recommended this; this is great.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> That's good to hear... Sometimes, you get someone making senseless comments like "chocolate mint is toothpaste".<br><strong>Karin:</strong> Isn't that because toothpaste is just mint flavored, and not that chocolate mint tastes like toothpaste?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> You got it, you really get it. It's such a relief you're one of the ones who understands, Karin.<br><strong>Karin:</strong> It's not that big a deal. Come on, we should head back soon.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> That's true. I still have plenty more to recommend you. I'll give you the rest of them on the train.<br><strong>Karin:</strong> Hey... They aren't all chocolate mint, are they?<br><a href="https://youtu.be/FUwv5IZDyA4">https://youtu.be/FUwv5IZDyA4</a></p><h2 id="fantasy---hiyori-start-welcome-to-the-world-of-fantasy" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Fantasy - Hiyori: Start]: Welcome to the World of Fantasy</h2><p><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Thank you for participating in today's test of our new training simulation system, Juujou-san, Morishita-san.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> I don't mind helping, but... Why is Morishita-san here? She's from the equipment department, isn't she?<br><strong>Kihiro:</strong> That would be to seek out inspiration, Miss Juujou!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Miss Juujou...?<br><strong>Kihiro:</strong> I may be a gen~ius, but constant output runs the well of my talents dry!<br><strong>Kihiro:</strong> Sometimes I like to get myself in harm's way~!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> I-Is that right...<br><strong>Kihiro:</strong> Now then, Miss Juujou! Let's go on our grand adventure!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Morishita-san, I hadn't finished explaining for Juujou-san yet.<br><strong>Kihiro:</strong> Whoops, how rude of me! I was getting ahead of myself!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Juujou-san?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> I-I'm fine. Just, getting a little overwhelmed by Morishita-san...<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Please keep up as best you can.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> This VR based combat training will be using a fantasy theme.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Fantasy?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> The enemies are still aradama, of course.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Though, since we can make use of VR, there were requests for us to make it more fun to train in.<br><strong>Kihiro:</strong> And so we're able to take a great journey across the world of fantasy~!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> I got it. So long as I can still fight aradama like usual, there won't be an issue.<br><strong>Kihiro:</strong> You're very reliable, Miss Juujou! I'll do all I can to support you too~!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Support me? What are you going to be doing in VR, Morishita-san?<br><strong>Kihiro:</strong> The character I'm playing is a support type! I can use simple attack magic of course, but giving support from the rear is my specialty!<br><strong>Kihiro:</strong> I'll give you just the support you need, Miss Juujou!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Y-You will then...<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> With that, let's start setting things up.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Data from your training will be collected automatically, so, once you've decided you've done enough, go and defeat the final boss. The simulation will end then.<br><strong>Kihiro:</strong> Understood, Miss Ban! Let's bring down the final boss together, buddy!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Y-Yeah...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> (......I'm not so sure about this.)  </p><h2 id="fantasy---hiyori-end-cheering-drone" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Fantasy - Hiyori: End]: Cheering Drone!</h2><p><strong>Aradama:</strong> GYAAGYAA!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Gh... Their attack power keeps going up...!<br><strong>Kihiro:</strong> At times like these, leave it to me! Activate magic: Cheering Drone!<br><strong>Kihiro:</strong> Go now, Miss Juujou! Bring down the aradama while your defense is boosted!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> GYAAAAAAA...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Thanks, Morishita-san.<br><strong>Kihiro:</strong> It's only reasonable I'd do this much!<br><strong>Kihiro:</strong> By the way, along with boosting defenses, Cheering Drone has one more hidden effect...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> D-Does it...?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> (I wasn't sure how this would turn out, but things are going well so far.)<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> (...Though, it's hard keeping up with Morishita-san.)<br><strong>Kihiro:</strong> You know, this was more intriguing than I was expecting! Miss Ban and her team have done a good job!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> She's right that this feels more like a game than usual training. This should make it easy for toji who don't like practicing to get into.<br><strong>Kihiro:</strong> And it would be even more fun forming a party with friends~!<br><strong>Kihiro:</strong> If I could request something, I'd want for it to be enhanced into a fully open world style VR game.<br><strong>Kihiro:</strong> Add in a plethora of skills, and it would fly off shelves if put out for sale. Then research funds would come pouring in!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...Leaving that aside, did you get any inspiration for making equipment?<br><strong>Kihiro:</strong> I certainly did! The spark of inspiration's shining bright! My plan is to shut myself in the laboratory as soon as we return!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Alright. We've fought enough battles, so we should be ready.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> She told us the training ends when we beat the final boss...<br><strong>Kihiro:</strong> We can travel through the map to the final boss room at any time. Are you prepared to go?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Yeah, let's go.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Thank you for going through the training. This allowed me to get some nice data.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> That's good.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> You can do it some other day, but I want you to submit a report on your personal experience with it.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Got it. Though, it was pretty incredible.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> It was like we really were on a fantasy adventure.<br><strong>Kihiro:</strong> Miss Ban! Whenever you're going to update this game, please let me know!<br><strong>Kihiro:</strong> I'd like to make equipment for it~!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> That... does sound interesting.<br><strong>Kihiro:</strong> Some equipment might be too dangerous to use in the real world, but, inside there, woohoo!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Fufu, I could get some good data from that.<br><strong>Kihiro:</strong> Miss Ban!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Morishita-san!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> (I get the feeling two people who should never team up just got put together...)<br><a href="https://youtu.be/61uP0-QaIpA">https://youtu.be/61uP0-QaIpA</a></p><h2 id="pirate---hiyori-start-inami-and-shichinosato-and" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Pirate - Hiyori: Start]: Inami and Shichinosato and...</h2><p><strong>Aradama:</strong> KSHAAAAAA...!!<br><strong>Suu:</strong> ...I-It's here!?  
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> (There's no way she'll beat it hunched over in fear like that--)<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Uwah!? Uwahh!?  
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> HAAH...!<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> GUOOooo...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Honestly... What are you even doing? Calm down and hold your okatana properly. Are you trying to get yourself hurt?<br><strong>Suu:</strong> ...G-Got it! Thank you so much, Juujou-san!<br><strong>Suu:</strong> You really did help me out back there...! I wasn't sure what would happen for a minute...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> I get that you're scared, but... If you keep acting like that on missions, you're going to get hurt someday. You and your--<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Hiyoyon, Inamin! Good news, I have a surprise for you-.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Nn? What do you mean, Ellen?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Get this. The amusement park people asked if we wanted to try playing with their new attraction.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> It's a special service, since us toji are always working so hard.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> You don't mean... "Treasures of the Pirates"...!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> You sure do know your stuff, Inamin.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Everyone else can't wait to try it, so, will you two be joining in?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Sure. Can't exactly... be the only one going back early.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Fufu, thanks for that~.  
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> What's this attraction like?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> From the sound of it, we're all pirates searching for treasure. You can steal maps from other pirates too... the other people competing to get the treasure, so there's different ways to play.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> You can steal maps from the other players?<br><strong>Suu:</strong> It's sort of a team battle treasure hunt, but all the maps each team gets are different, and some of them are supposed to be fakes.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> I see. It sounds a bit tough. How about let Kofuki know and head over for now.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> U-Um... I'll let you two tell Shichinosato-san about this by yourselves.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Sure thing. Don't worry. I'll break it to Fukki so she'll join us for sure-!<br><strong>Suu:</strong> I-I leave it to you...!<br><strong>Suu:</strong> ...So then, we'll be aiming to clear "Treasures of the Pirates" with the teams we were in fighting aradama before...<br><strong>Suu:</strong> But, what should we do? Juujou-san, Shichinosato-san...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> I don't really have a choice, so I'll do this with you; at least till we get to the X on the map.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Are we fine with not going after the other team's maps?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Mihocchi was all, "Let's plunder-!" but if the map you steal's no good, there's no point.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> ...I think that's fine! It's important to clear the game fast too!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> There is a time limit; they were saying it goes until the cannons fire 3 times.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> It should be just about thirty minutes.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> We might be hard on time if we get in fights.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> There's a drawing like a cave on our treasure map, so we should go there first...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> You can hold onto the map.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> You know I'm just here to make the team's even, right?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Suu's... not the most reliable.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> ......<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Tch... Guess if I've gotta.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Ehh...

This has to be it--<br><strong>Suu:</strong> --HYAUU!?  
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Don't shout like that outta nowhere... You made me jump.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> But some water dripped on me! They made this way too real in some weird places...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Anyway, you were just saying you thought this was it; why's that?<br><strong>Suu:</strong> They put a lot of effort into making this place, so I don't think they'd go this far if the right treasure wasn't here.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Putting it pretty straight out there. Though, this does feel like the kinda place that'd have a pirate treasure.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> So that's another way of looking for it. Then, there's a good chance the treasure's up ahead.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> The old pirates' treasured pendants should be here. Finding that is the best way to get points in this game.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Oi... Look! Over there.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Wow... That's a super realistic looking skeleton!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> This must be it. Hey you, go and get the thing.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Roger that-. Inami Suu is setting off-.<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> GYUUU...!<br><strong>Suu:</strong> GYAAH!? Something came out!?  
<strong>Suu:</strong> ...A-A-A-Aradamaaa!?  
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...What!? After it!<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> ......<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> You're running around all over the place, but this is it!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> It was so small it hardly showed up on the spectrum finder, so it's a good thing we found it.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> There might be others around; let's look.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Should we message Ellen and Kiyoka and them?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Shouldn't have to. The two of us are enough. Well, I could do it myself though.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Maybe you could, but you shouldn't go alone.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...What about Suu?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> There was just one of them, so she'll be fine back there. Let's get this done as fast as we can.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Even if... I don't want to fight aradama... I thought it was really mean the way you left me behind!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> We still came back fast enough.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> I think that place might have been starting to give me a fear of the dark too...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Though from the looks of it, it didn't.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> And anyway, thanks to you, we got the pendant.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Juujou-san, are you... trying really poorly to make me feel better?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...Urgh. I do feel a little bad.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Next time something happens, I'll beat some aradama-chan for you to make up for it.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> And you... You just want to hunt aradama yourself, am I wrong?<br><strong>Suu:</strong> That's right, tell her some more!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Oh! Mihocchi and Kiyoka are headed over. Go shove this pendant in their faces, Hunchback.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Hunchback!? Could you please not call me weird names...
