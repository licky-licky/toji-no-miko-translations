What do you need, Yume?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Is it true you're going on a trip alone together with Suzuka-onee-san? Why am I the only one who has to stay behind! It's boring here!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Who told you something that misleading... We're not going on a trip; we're suppressing aradama.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> That sounds even funner! You two get to do all the good stuff!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Don't act so spoiled, Yume. With us having only just been reorganized into the Special Defense Team, we're short on hands.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> We can't afford to neglect our duty to guard the Origami family and escort Akane-sama. Do you understand what I'm saying?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> ...Well, if I have to-.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> But you better buy me a souvenir!! Get me an Ichigo Daifuku Neko they sell there!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Got it. I'll buy you one, so long as I don't forget.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> ......<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Why the troubled face? How about you have a drink of tea and relax?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> I'll take it...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> You don't have to be so nervous. This will go fine. We only have to do it like we normally do.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> I'm not feeling nervous. It's just...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Just?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> It's just a little hard to calm down.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Doesn't that mean you're getting nervous?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> ...Maybe. I guess you're right.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> That's how you are, Maki-san.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> It's because we can't stop for anything until we atone for the past.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> You aren't entirely wrong to think that way, but... If you obsess over it, you'll only be making yourself suffer, alright?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> I know that, but, still.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> You're very serious, Maki-san.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> That's just how I am; I can't help it.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> By the way... Do you think they sell Ichigo Daifuku Nekos where the mission is taking place?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Did Yume ask about it?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Seems like she wants a souvenir.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Of course she would.

These numbers may be too much after all.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I should regroup with Maki-san for now...<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> OOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Kh... For me to have let my guard down here...!!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> So I'm surrounded then...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...What a mess I've put myself in.

<strong>Mirja:</strong> Calm yourself, Yamashiro Yui. Do you remember before, when Itomi Sayaka appeared in that film?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Oh yeah, that happened, didn't it. It was that time with the historical drama thing, right?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> If you mean that, I remember it too! Sayaka-chan was extra cute back then, wasn't she!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> It seems the director from then has made another offer.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> So they've had their eyes on Mirja-san ever since then... They sure know their stuff.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> What's she talking about now.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> No, that isn't entirely wrong... It seems that, somehow, they remember me from then, and made an offer.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> See!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> What're you looking all smug for!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Anyway, I'm 100% going to go see it, Mirja-san! I'll see it 7 million 7 hundred and 70 thousand times!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Actually, when are they filming it! I want to go watch!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> On Halloween day.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Halloween day!?  
<strong>Yui:</strong> That's when I was supposed to go with Kanami-chan and them to their Halloween event...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Gununu... Do I go see Kanami-chan and Hiyori-chan in their costumes, or do I go see Mirja-san...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I should mention, along with myself, Itomi Sayaka and Iwakura Sanae will also be performing.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Sayaka-chan and Sanae-san too!? B-Both of them are hard to pass up...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> You're making a pretty funny face now, y'know?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> How can I choose though!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> No matter how much you puzzle over it, I won't bring you with me. This is work.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> I understand...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> I'll wait with bated breath to see the precious sight of Mirja-san when the movie opens, and prioritize the event where I'll only have one chance to see Kanami-chan and everyone!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> That isn't what I meant... Though, if you can accept that, then it's fine.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Well, if that's how it is, then you'd better get your body in shape for it.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Here, eat these niboshi. Want some milk with that too?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ...Why niboshi and milk?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> If they're asking for you, it's cause they want you to play a kaiju, right? You've gotta be at least two meters for it then.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Of course I wouldn't receive an offer to play a kaiju. ...I will be playing a nun.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> A nun? That'll be a laugh.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> That's not true! She'd look just perfect as one!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Well, either way, give it your best shot.

Since this is my first time doing something like this, I'm so nervous my hands won't stop shaking...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Nervousness brought on by apprehension?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Though, knowing you, you must have prepared extensively in advance, didn't you?<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> I did; I made sure to practice, and I memorized how to say all my lines right!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> In that case, there should be nothing for you to worry about. You'll do just fine.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Thank you, Kitora-san... But, if I don't double check, I'll be too nervous...<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...The script.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Th-Thanks, Itomi-san!<br><strong>Staff:</strong> We're starting-.

Ready-, start!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> That sound... From upstairs...?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> (...Suspcious of the sounds coming from the second floor, I go to investigate.

For you to be so shocked, my mischief was a big sucess nya!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> J-Just what are you!<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> What am I?

I-I'll destroy you here!<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> You can go ahead and try, nya!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> (Iwakura Sanae comes rushing in... I fight back with the candlestick I'm holding.)<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Unyaa!?  
<strong>Mirja:</strong> It's afraid of the flames...? Then!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> (Throwing the candlestick, while she's frightened by the flames, I take the knife I had hidden...!)

It ran away? ...What is happening in this mansion...?<br><strong>Staff:</strong> Okaaay, that's good.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Phew, nicely done, Iwakura Sanae. Thanks to your performance, we were able to make a fine action scene.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Not at all! It's because of you, Mirja-san, that I think I was able to act so well!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Then, why don't we say it's because of the both of us?<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Alright! Ahh... Now that that's over, I'm feeling kind of hungry.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> In that case, once Itomi Sayaka's scene is finished, how about we go to eat together?<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Sure thing! There's a delicious mizusawa udon place close by!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Mizusawa udon is the udon of Gunma, isn't it? This isn't Gunma, though?<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> I looked it up beforehand, thinking it could come in handy!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I-I see...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> (What exactly was she expecting to need it for...

You have lots of similar jackets you can go back and get.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Doesn't matter; what pisses me off pisses me off!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Then, how about next day we have off, we go clothes shopping together?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Clothes shopping? I haven't been in a while, so that sounds good.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Nice! You should come too, Tsugumi-san! It's a date!  </p><h2 id="aradama-hoodie---kofuki-end-on-to-the-shopping" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Aradama Hoodie - Kofuki: End]: On To the Shopping!</h2><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> And with that, we're here, Harajuku!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Yawwn... I'm tired.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> That's because you were asleep on the train. Here, have some of this and you'll be wide awake.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Oh-... Thanks...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> BFWOO-!?  
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Oi, what'd you feed me!!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Just something simple to eliminate drowsiness.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Don't pass me toxic crap like it's no big deal! You're freaky.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Am I?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Fukki's looking wide awake now at least, so let's go buy some clothes!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> By the way, how do you pick out your clothes, Fukki?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I remember Kiyoka saying, "Fukki's got a great sense of style!", so I've been curious ever since.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> I just pick out whatever. Cruise around the shops and buy stuff...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> See, like that? Ohm.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> You say, "like that", but... Where'd you find these hoodies?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> They were in the middle of the store, remember? [chew chew]<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I didn't see it... Nnn, this kind of thing's pretty cute too.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> It looks good on you, Mihocchi. This's good.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Thanks, Fukki.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> It's somewhat embarrassing the way we all match though, isn't it?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> You think so? [chew chew] Mm-!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...That crepe must be yummy, huh.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...[grin] Mihocchi, you want a bite?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Can I?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Sure, but you get one bite, alright? Here... Open wide.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ahh-... Nngh!?  
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Hey, Fukki! Weren't you gonna let me have some!?  
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Ahahahahaha! If you wanted to eat some, then go buy it yourself, Mihocchi.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Ohm. ...[chew chew] I see, it is fairly good.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Hey, don't you go eating it!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Now's my chance... Mmm-, so good!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Mihocchi too!? Ahh, damnit! Gimme back the bits you ate!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> How am I supposed to do that when I ate it!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> You could just go buy another one, Shichinosato-san.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Like you can talk when you're the one who went and ate it-!<br><a href="https://youtu.be/bUqlN1QeE1o">https://youtu.be/bUqlN1QeE1o</a></p><h2 id="stage-girl---kanami-start-somebody-i-want-to-spar-with" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Stage Girl - Kanami: Start]: Somebody I Want to Spar With!</h2><p><strong>Maya:</strong> Now then, I'll have you leave the stage. --HAAH!<br><strong>Karen:</strong> YAH!<br><strong>Karen:</strong> Nice!

They fight differently from a toji, but I'm enjoying myself just watching them go!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Ahh... You can't help but be captivated by them, can you~.  
<strong>Yui:</strong> Would you call it their posturing? Every one of the motions they go through grabs hold tight of my heart... It's so good!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah, I know just what you mean! Ahh, even if only for a little bit, I want to spar with all the stage girls!<br><strong>Karen:</strong> Kanami-chan, Kanami-chan, what's "spar" mean?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah, sparring is when you face off... It's a practice match!<br><strong>Karen:</strong> A practice match, huh~. I think I might wanna have one too!<br><strong>Futaba:</strong> It'd be useful reference material for sword fights on stage, wouldn't it.<br><strong>Kaoruko:</strong> Sure would. Though, I'm not about to join you.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Sure! You only have to join in if you want to! I don't think it's good to force training in.<br>Hikari Slipping through my firmly raised hands, the vow we made that day fell into the abyss. I once again climb towards my stage of destiny. Even if it must end in tragedy... 99th generation, Kagura Hikari. It is all for the sake of Starlight!</p><p><strong>Kanami:</strong> Wow-, being able to recite a line like that so smoothly; people training to be pros sure are something else.<br><strong>Hikari:</strong> I am a stage girl, so this much is natural.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Even still, it's pretty amazing.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Oh yeah, thanks, Hikari-chan.<br><strong>Hikari:</strong> What? Why are you thanking me suddenly?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> For sparring with me. I'm really happy you agreed!<br><strong>Hikari:</strong> I just thought this experience might be useful on the stage. Are you ready?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I'm ready to go anytime!<br><strong>Hikari:</strong> Then... --YAH!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> That was a nice thrust, Hikari-chan! Now I'll go! HAAH!<br><strong>Hikari:</strong> ...Kh! Then, I'll--!<br><strong>Hikari:</strong> ...You're watching my movements closely.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> That's good!

That was a little risky just now!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> You're using the spring in your body to get even sharper with your strikes! That was a great thrust!<br><strong>Hikari:</strong> ...You were able to dodge that just now? Toji really do have great physical performance.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> It's important to be able to avoid taking hits in battle, after all. That's a part of training too.<br><strong>Hikari:</strong> Then, what will you do if I do this?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Eh!? You threw your weapon!?  
<strong>Hikari:</strong> Thank you. You deflected it just how I wanted you to.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Wawah!? ...She's flying with a wire!?  
<strong>Hikari:</strong> And now--!!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Seeing that attack just now you did with the wire sent a chill up my spine-. You were right up in front of me all of a sudden.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> So you can fight like that too, huh!<br><strong>Hikari:</strong> ...You blocked it so easily though.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I mean, if I didn't block that right, I'd be done for. It wasn't easy for me at all.<br><strong>Hikari:</strong> There's something I want to ask you... Why did you decide to have a match with me?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Because I saw you not even flinching as you were fighting aradama, I guess.<br><strong>Hikari:</strong> That should be the same for the other stage girls too. We all want the auditions to resume soon.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> You're right, but you were still a little different after all. I think it would be scary to fight with that short sword-like dagger, Hikari-chan.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> But still, you have a strong determination to fight. That's the feeling I got. So that's why I wanted to spar with you.<br><strong>Hikari:</strong> ......<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> And once we got down to it, it was super exciting!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah! I wish I could try moving around with wires like you did, Hikari-chan-.<br><strong>Hikari:</strong> You can't; I won't give it to you.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I can't-? That's a bit of a shame!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Hey. Hikari-chan, what did you think of sparring with me?<br><strong>Hikari:</strong> Hm, real swordfighting was incredible. Teach me. Even if it's only the basic movements.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Sure thing! I'll welcome anybody interested in swordfighting with open arms! We'll start with your stance, okay?<br><strong>Hikari:</strong> This kind of seems like it could take a while...
