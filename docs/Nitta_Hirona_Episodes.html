Come play with Mimi-!<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ......Sigh, this again. [muttered]<br><strong>Mimi:</strong> Huh? Maybe she didn't hear me? Are your ears feeling stuffed up? Hey, Hirona-onee-san?<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ...I can hear youuu.<br><strong>Mimi:</strong> I'm glad you can hear me then!<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> (.........Sigh. Because of Kagami-san, I haven't been able to do things according to plan lately.)<br><strong>Mimi:</strong> Hey hey hey hey! Come play with Mimi, Hirona-onee-san!<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> .........<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> (Why exactly is she so attached to me... It's not like I did anything with her... Hmm.)<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ...I have an aradama suppression mission today, so we can't play.<br><strong>Mimi:</strong> Really? That's too bad...<br><strong>Mimi:</strong> Then, when'll we get to play, Hirona-onee-san!<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ...It's hard to sayyy.<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> (...Though, I don't think that day is ever cominggg.)<br><strong>Mimi:</strong> Hirona-onee-san, let's make sure to play tomorrow!<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> (......She's even doing this in the dormmms?)<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ...Kagami-san, do you not have friends?<br><strong>Mimi:</strong> Huh? I do?<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ...Then I think it would be better if you left me alone and played with them.<br><strong>Mimi:</strong> You're my friend too, Hirona-onee-san, so it's all alright!<br><strong>Mimi:</strong> And anyway, you can just call me Mimi, Hirona-onee-san!<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ......No thank youuu.<br><strong>Mimi:</strong> Why not!?  
<strong>Hirona:</strong> (...Because if I'm looking after you, my efficiency will go down.)<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> (I don't want to get any less efficient... I'll alter my routine tomorrow so I won't run into Kagami-san.)<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> Yawn............<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> I might have woken up too early after allll.<br><strong>Mimi:</strong> But it feels great waking up early, doesn't it!<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> .........<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> Do you normally eat breakfast at this time, Kagami-san?<br><strong>Mimi:</strong> Nope.<br><strong>Mimi:</strong> I just had a feeling you'd be here right now, Hirona-onee-san!<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> Ugh...<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> (Is it on instinnnct...? I have a sort of bad feeling about this...)<br><strong>Mimi:</strong> Fooound you, Hirona-onee-san!<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ...Kagami-san, your voice is too loud.<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> (I thought that I wouldn't see her if I adjusted my time in the library...)<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> Why did you think I would be here?<br><strong>Mimi:</strong> When you weren't in the classroom, I just looked everywhere around school.<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ...Didn't you think I could have gone home early?<br><strong>Mimi:</strong> Nope! Cause, you're Hirona-onee-san after all!<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> (......That's not a reasonnn.)<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> (Still... Kagami-san's impulsiveness is completely outside my ability to plan around.)<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> (......Instead of being indirect, it might be faster to to say it straight here.)<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ...Kagami-san. Please don't come up to me anymore. You're bothering me.<br><strong>Mimi:</strong> Yeah, I hear that a lot! Like, Mimi, you're a little troublemaker!<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ......Didn't I say you were bothering me?<br><strong>Mimi:</strong> But, I still like you, Hirona-onee-san, so I'm gonna come see you!<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ......<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> (Calling it "innocence" sounds better, but... this girl just doesn't listen to people...)<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ...Sigh. Fine then, do what you want.<br><strong>Mimi:</strong> You mean it!?  
<strong>Hirona:</strong> ...Trying to get rid of you was less efficient.<br><strong>Mimi:</strong> Hooray! Then, starting today, call me Mimi!<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ......<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ......No thank youuu.  </p><h2 id="2-the-four-of-us-shopping" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>2: The Four of Us Shopping</h2><p>On a day off...</p><p><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Our goal today is... to pick out clothes for Nitta-san!<br><strong>Mihono/Yui:</strong> Yeah-!<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ......Yeah-.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> What kind of clothes do you think would look good on Hirona?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I get the feeling anything would work on her. She could wear something cool or something cute just fine.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> The more lightly dressed the better!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That's rejected.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> ...Awww.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ahaha!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Hmm, which would look good on Hirona... Ah, I bet Kohime'd like this one!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I'm going to go buy it real quick!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> You're totally in love with Kohime-chan, aren't you, Mihono-chan! It's so precious it hurts though!<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ......It sure is.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I'm back-. Okay, so what should we do?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I want to have a short strategy meeting first, so how about we find something to eat?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Like crepes?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Crepes...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> What's wrong, Kiyoka-chan?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I've been a little worried about my waistline recently... You know, it'll be summer soon, and then...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ahh, cause of swimsuits.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> But I'd still like you if your belly's a little soft, Kiyoka-chan.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I don't care if you'd like it...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> That's so mean!? But I like that too!!<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah, sorry, Hirona! We sort of got off-topic, didn't we.<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ...No, it's fun just listening to you three talk.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Is it though?<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> It is.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (Still, we came to hang out with the four of us, so I want Hirona to be having a good time too.)<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (Okay, I'll come up with something for Hirona to talk about!)  
<strong>Hirona:</strong> ...<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ...Ah, Musumi-san. I really like that outfit thereee.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Oh, it's so cute. I think I like it a lot too.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> You two should try it on! I'll be waiting for you!<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ...But you're planning on peeping, aren't youuu?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> She found me out!?  
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Wait, huh!? Hirona naturally worked her way into the conversation!?  
<strong>Hirona:</strong> ...What do you take me for? I know the flow of your conversations, so I can join in.<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ...Actually, Asakura-san, were you thinking of looking out for meee?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...You noticed?<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> It seemed like something you'd dooo. But changing the flow of the conversation would leave odd pauses, so isn't that less efficient?<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> That's why I tried joining in now and thennn.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Then you could've just joined in from the start!?  
<strong>Hirona:</strong> Sorrrry about that. Even when I wasn't talking, the conversation was still moving smoothly, sooo.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Does anybody ever tell you you're strange, Hirona?<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ...How did you knowww? For some reason, I get told that sometimes.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> No, I think the reason's pretty clear!  </p><h2 id="3-my-hero" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>3: My Hero</h2><p><strong>Yuuki:</strong> Hirona-san, are you busy later?<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ......I'm availableee.<br><strong>Yuuki:</strong> Then, let's make an appointment to go shopping in half an hour!<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> Okaaay.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> ...<br>That evening...</p><p><strong>Akira:</strong> Yo, Hirona.<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> .........Oh, Akira-san. Did you need somethiiing?<br><strong>Akira:</strong> You go along with whatever Yuuki asks you, don't you.<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> I do?<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Yeah.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> But you're all about efficiency. And you actually had some plans today, didn't you?<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> I did, but Yuuki-san took higher priority.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Hmm.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> I never asked, but, did something happen between you and Yuuki?<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> Something with... Yuuki-saaan?<br><strong>Hitakami Toji 1:</strong> Huh!? Nitta-san's in the same unit as us for this mission!?  
<strong>Hitakami Toji 2:</strong> Didn't the last unit Nitta-san was part of break up after she stabbed them in the back?<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> .........<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> (......It's not like I turned on them because I wanted to stab them in the back.)<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> (It was just more efficient that way... Though I doubt they would listen if I explained that.)<br><strong>Hitakami Toji 1:</strong> Hey, Nitta-san.<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> .........Yes?<br><strong>Hitakami Toji 2:</strong> Do you think we could work separate from each other? So long as we suppress the aradama, it doesn't matter.<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> .........<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> Alriiight. That would be more efficient, wouldn't ittt.<br><strong>Hitakami Toji 1:</strong> Thanks.<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> (You don't have to sound so relieved... I wouldn't turn on anyone in a normal suppression assignment.)<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ...Well, I can do this more efficiently on my own thoughhh.<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> [pant pant]...<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> GYAAAAAAAAAAA!<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> --! HAAHH!!<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> GYOHHHHHHHHHH!<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> .........More of them, againnn.<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> (This is as hard as you'd expect... I wonder how those two are doing...)<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> OOOOOOOOO!<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> Kgh!?  
<strong>Hirona:</strong> [pant pant]...<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> This isn't the time to worry about others, is ittt..<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> (I really won't be able to keep fighting any longer... I'd like to find some way of escaping, but...)<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ...The problem is, which do I go withhh.<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> (If I stay here, things will only get worse...)<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> All or nothing... Is that what it comes down tooo. Sigh, how inefficient...<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> GUOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ...This was a bust, wasn't it.<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> GAOOOOOOOOOOO!<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> Grgh...!?  
<strong>Aradama:</strong> GYAAAAAAAAAAAA!!<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> (Is this it...!?)<br><strong>Yuuki:</strong> HAAAAAAAAAAH!!<br><strong>Yuuki:</strong> Are you okay!?  
<strong>Hirona:</strong> ...Yuuki-san? Why are you here...?<br><strong>Yuuki:</strong> When you were the only one who didn't come back, I asked the other two what happened, and they said you were acting on your own.<br><strong>Yuuki:</strong> So I came looking for you.<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ...Thank you very much.<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ...And that's how it happened.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Huh, way to go, Yuuki.<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> (......Well, that story should be enough to satisfy Akira-san-.)<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> (Though, the truth is I owe her something much harder to repay... But that's not something I'd tell anyone.)  </p><h2 id="4-determination" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>4: Determination</h2><p><strong>Aradama:</strong> GYAOOOOOOOOOOO!!<br><strong>Toji A:</strong> The aradama are attacking!!<br><strong>Toji B:</strong> Why're there so many aradama!?

Who are youuu?<br><strong>Miyako:</strong> Sasano Miyako, from the research course. Good to meet you, Nitta-san.<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> .........It's nice to meet you.<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ...Oh? Am I wrong, or is your left arm...<br><strong>Miyako:</strong> It is. It happened... a long time ago.<br><strong>Miyako:</strong> Your mission this time, it was difficult for you all, wasn't it.<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ......It was.<br><strong>Miyako:</strong> The kind of thing you'd call inefficient, right?<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> .........Yes. Actually, it's because nothing about that mission was efficient.<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ...Ah. Does that count as criticizing the head of the Origami family?<br><strong>Miyako:</strong> Maybe. I think it'd be best not to say much about that.<br><strong>Miyako:</strong> Though... It was interesting talking to you. Anyway, I'll see you around.<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ...Goodbye.<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ......What was that about, anyway?<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ...After being away from school for so long, I get called right away by the president.

In that case, it's alllright.<br><strong>Sana:</strong> She's a funny one.<br><strong>Miyako:</strong> I thought you might like her. ...What do you think?<br><strong>Sana:</strong> Sure, I don't see why not.<br><strong>Sana:</strong> I'm going to get straight to the point... Nitta, do you want to join Mokusa?<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> Mokusa?<br><strong>Sana:</strong> Mokusa opposes Origami Yukari... It's an organization formed to oppose the revisionists led by Origami Yukari, with the intent of restoring okatana and toji to the state they should be.<br><strong>Sana:</strong> Nobody's going to force you, but... You want to change the way things are now too, don't you, Nitta?<br><strong>Sana:</strong> What do you say?<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ............<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> Alright thennn.<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> Toji being injured is inefficient, sooo. If it improves our situation, I'll joiiin.<br><strong>Sana:</strong> ...I had a feeling you'd say that.<br><strong>Sana:</strong> Nitta, there's somebody out there with similar opinions to yours. Do you want to go meet them now?<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> With similar opinions to mine... I want to meet them. Could you tell me their name for nowww?<br><strong>Sana:</strong> Sure. Her name is... Hitakami Makoto.  </p><h2 id="5-an-inefficient-method" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>5: An Inefficient Method</h2><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> Have you finished preparing for your trip to Okinawa?<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ......Yeeep, I'm ready to go-. I have my summer clothes and swimsuit with meee.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Your swimsuit? You know you're not going there for fun, right?<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ...I know thaaat.<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> But, I won't know what I'll need, and couldn't the target I'm observing say she wants to go to the beach?<br><strong>Yuuki:</strong> This great aradama the Sword Administration Bureau is safeguarding... Her name was Kohime? Would great aradamas really be interested in things like going to the beach?<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> If it were Tagitsuhime, surely she wouldn't.<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ...I think she might because of Asakura-san's influence. She became attached to Asakura-san.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Cause of Mihono then...<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Damnit, now that Mihono's started showing those powers, I really don't want to be giving up somebody trustworthy.<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> This observation mission in Okinawa is also something we could only leave to someone we can trust.<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ......<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ...Please leave Okinawa to meee.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> I get all that, okay.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Ahh, fuck it! Things just can't go our way, can they!<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> Akira-chan?<br><strong>Akira:</strong> I'm going for a ride to clear my head!<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> I suppose that's the end of that.<br><strong>Yuuki:</strong> What are you going to do now, Makoto-nee-sama?<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> I'm sure that Akira-chan will be back in time for dinner, so I'll get the food ready.<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> Hirona-san, you should stay and eat with us today.<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ...Thank you very muuuch.<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> It's the two of us now. What will you do, Yuuki-san?<br><strong>Yuuki:</strong> I'm going to do my secret training. You should join me, Hirona-san!<br><strong>Yuuki:</strong> HAAAAAAAAAAH!!<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ...<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> (Once I'm in Okinawa... I won't be able to join Yuuki-san for a while.)<br><strong>Yuuki:</strong> YAAAAAH!<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ...Oh, I lost, didn't I.<br><strong>Yuuki:</strong> Hirona-san! Please stay focused! I have to... I have to train to be even stronger!<br><strong>Yuuki:</strong> Please go another round with me!<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ...Okaaay.<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> (If Yuuki-san wants to be stronger... Becoming a tamayori toji would be the efficient thing to do.)<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> (But...)<br><strong>Yuuki:</strong> YAAAAAAAAAAAA!<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> Nh...<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> That was a good strike just now.<br><strong>Yuuki:</strong> You mean it!?  
<strong>Hirona:</strong> ...I wouldn't want that, would I.<br><strong>Yuuki:</strong> Hirona-san?<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ...Just talking to myseeelf.<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ...More importantly, let's go another round, before you forget the feeling of that strike.<br><strong>Yuuki:</strong> Okay!
