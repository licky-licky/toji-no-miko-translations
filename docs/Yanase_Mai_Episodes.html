Today's special guest is... Mihono-chan!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Umm. Hi, Yanase-san. Sorry if I'm being a bother.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I ran into Kanami before, and she said I should tag along, so...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Don't worry, it's fine. Sorry I invited you here so abruptly, Asakura-san, Kanami-chan.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah, something smells really good!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Mai-chan, you made that, didn't you! The stuff that's all sticky and smooth~.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> That's right. I can't believe you figured it out already, Kanami-chan. I made pudding, but actually...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Ah, you should try some first! I just hope it turned out alright.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Everything you make turns out great, Mai-chan!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> ...R-Right.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Yanase-san? What's wrong? You look upset about something.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Sorry, it's nothing! Here, come on inside!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Whoa, it looks delicious. You sure I can eat this!?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Of course. If you're sure you want some, go right ahead.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> No one in the world wouldn't want your cooking, Mai-chan! Anyway, I'm digging in-!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Me too! Down the hatch-!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Mhmmm, ahh...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> It's... It's too yummy!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Thank goodness. But, um... Was there anything else that you noticed about it?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> It's just really tasty.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah, it's so tasty!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Th-Thank you. But, let's see, for example, if it tastes like anything you've tried before...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Like, maybe, a certain shop's pudding...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Anything I've tried? Umm... Mihono-chan, what do you think?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I don't really... Go out shopping much, so I don't know. But, Yanase-san, I feel like your pudding's better than anything I could buy?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah, I feel the same! I've never had anything like it. Mai-chan, your pudding's amazing!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> ...A-Ahaha, thank you.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Mai-chan? Something's bothering you, isn't it?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> It's not a big deal... This was just a bit of a failure.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Eh, how!?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> To tell the truth, I was trying to copy the pudding from a shop I love.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> A shop Mai-chan loves... "Plumeria"?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ahh... Mmm? Now that you mention it, it tastes sort of alike, I think?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (Ughh, I can't believe I said I don't go out much...)<br><strong>Mai:</strong> No, don't worry about it, Kanami-chan... After all, it'd be strange if I could copy a famous chef's pudding so easily.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> My little sisters, they told me they wanted to be able get the same taste at home. So I kept on practicing time and time again, and kept going to eat the real thing to compare, and I used all the same materials, just as fresh...!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yanase... San?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I tried heating with different intensity, and steaming it differently, and lots of different containers. But why, even though I keep on trying... No, I just can't get it to taste any good.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I love cooking sweets so much, but in the end I'm just an amateur...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> You're frustrated, huh, Mai-chan.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Eh, you can tell...?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> It's kind of hard not to notice, I think?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Oh no, I'm sorry. I just got carried away.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> It's alright. I almost never get to see you like this, after all.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Eh?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> You're usually so calm and composed, and it feels like you can do anything. But seeing you act like this is pretty cute too. Right, Mihono-chan?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah, I feel like my image of Yanase-san changed a little!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Eh... Really...?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Hey, do you want to try this again, Mai-chan? I'll sample it as much as you want. You'll join in too, right, Mihono-chan?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah, if you'll let me, I'll try some anytime. Today's was good too! I mean it; it was really yummy!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Asakura-san, Kanami-chan...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Thank you. I'm so glad I had you two taste it.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I'm a little depressed, but I'll keep on trying... I'll challenge it again, I promise!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah! I'm looking forward to it. But if you mess up, that's okay. It just means we get to eat even more!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I think I'd be happy with that too?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Geez, cut it out, you two. Next time I'll get it right for sure! ...Fufu.  </p><h2 id="2-what-is-femininity" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>2: What is Femininity?</h2><p><strong>Mai:</strong> What should I do with these? I made too many cookies. Kanami-chan would be able to eat them all, but... She isn't back yet.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Thank goodness, I got this month's edition. I have to get back to my room and read the latest report-<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Eh!?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Kyaa!<br><em>the two collide</em></p><p><strong>Mai:</strong> Oww... S-Sorry. I was lost in thought.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> No, I wasn't looking where I was going...! I'm so sorry!!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Um, you're Musumi-san, right? Are you hurt? This magazine... It's yours, isn't it? Here.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Thank you so much! And I really am sorry. You're... Yanase-san, aren't you?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Yes. From Minoseki.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ahhhh!! Yanase-san, when I bumped into you just now, did those...!?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Oh my. The cookies... They got crushed, didn't they? But please, don't worry about it.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I'm so sorry, were they a present from someone? I'll buy you replacements.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Oh, these are just something I made myself. Really, it's not worth fussing over.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Eh!? You mean those are handmade!? They look so cute...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> They might be a little broken, but would you like to try them?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Can I!?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> These are delicious...! Can you share the recipe with me, Yanase-san?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Recipe? ...I don't really use them. I just go with what feels right when I'm cooking.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> More importantly, Musumi-san, there's crumbs getting on your magazine...! Here, lay this handkerchief on top of it.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Ah, that's right. Take a tissue as well, so you can wipe your hands.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...You're so feminine, Yanase-san.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Eh?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I'm jealous...! I could never be so considerate, and cooking without a recipe would just be impossible for me...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> It's not like that. Baking things is just my hobby. When I'm cooking, I can really lose myself in it, and when I'm done, I like seeing others enjoy it.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> What about you, Musumi-san? What do you do in your spare time?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Eh, me...? Reading, is about all I do.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Reading? What kind of books do you read?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> L-Love stories, mostly. And, I read magazines... Like this one.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Is that so. Let me see... "The Number 1 Must Buys This Season, Introducing Kamo Chinami's Mix and Match Technique"...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> This report is always so handy. If you pick out whatever appears in here, it can make any outfit look cuter.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It's a big help in picking out accessories, for example, or, i-if I ever go on a date, what to wear...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> R-Really? Musumi-san, you seem so... Mature.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Eh....? Yanase-san, are you not interested in this kind of thing?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I-I never really thought about it much.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I don't know that much about it myself. I just think, whenever I'm going out, that I should be a little fashionable. If someone ever thinks I'm cute, well...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That'd be wonderful.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Somehow, I feel like... You're already pretty wonderful, Musumi-san. Talking to you like this, it's like you're sparkling.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> It's normal for girls to be interested in wearing cute clothes, isn't it? But I'm clueless when it comes to this...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> In that case, Yanase-san! I'll lend you this magazine!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Eh?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> If you read it, I'm sure you'll feel much better about fashion. Think of it as a thank you for these cute cookies.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I really wish I could make you cookies like these as thanks, but it seems too difficult for me...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Musumi-san... Thank you. But, isn't this this month's issue? You can give it to me after you're through reading it.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Oh, before then... If you're interested, how about we bake cookies together next time?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> It doesn't have to be cookies either. We can make all sorts of cute sweets that'll get you all worked up.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Eh!? You don't mind me joining you?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Of course not. When it comes to making sweets, I have some experience. And, next time...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I'd like it if you shared with me some of your magazines.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That sounds great! I'll bring all kinds with me!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Fufu. Then, until next time. It's a promise.  </p><h2 id="3-as-a-toji" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>3: As a Toji</h2><p><strong>Chie:</strong> Mihono-chan, Kiyoka-chan! It seems like... We managed to deal with all the aradama.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> It's all thanks to the help of our reinforcement. I'm Setouchi Chie. And you are...?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Yanase Mai, from Minoseki. I'm a classmate of Asakura-san... Of Mihono-chan.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> You saved us-! Thanks, Mai. That's Minoseki's tournament rep for you; you were awesome back there!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ahhh, oh yeah! Musumi-san, are you okay?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Yes... Um, sorry, I'm just... I'm not very good at fighting...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Kya! Another aradama!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Still...!? Yanase-san, our teammates should be returning any minute, so could you help us a little longer?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Of course!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Minoseki's representative... I can see why. Even against those aradama, your posture never faltered, and your swordsmanship stayed clean.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> See? I told you she's good, Chii-nee.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Th-Thank you.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> And, on top of that, she's a super rich girl. She's got a butler and everything!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> A butler... That sounds kind of amazing.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> B-But wait, then why are you a toji? It's a dangerous position. For a high class girl like you...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> You're right, it's a little weird. But being a toji is a really respectable position, isn't it? Maybe her family wanted her to do it or something.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> ...I decided to become a toji and worked towards it on my own.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> It's dangerous work, but it also keeps everyone safe. So I wanted to try it.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Luckily, I was capable of using an okatana, and one of them accepted me.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> You sound so responsible. At least, I wouldn't expect that from a middle schooler.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Why're you looking at me, Chii-nee.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> But, aren't you scared?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I do get scared. Though, when I grip my okatana, all those feelings fade away.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I train with that in mind, and somehow I manage.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> That's so cool, Mai. It's like you have a totally different kind of strength than Kanami.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> You have to try your best too, Mihono-chan. Starting with your concentration... Right?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ahaha... I need to work on that, huh...  </p><h2 id="4-late-night-cookies" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>4: Late Night Cookies</h2><p><strong>Mai:</strong> Excuse me...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Umm... Itomi Sayaka-chan...? I'm Yanase Mai, a second year middle schooler at Minoseki Academy. Could I talk to you for a little while...?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ......<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Uh, well, I heard you fought with the runaway Kanami-chan and Juujou-san...<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...They escaped. Because I lost.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> So Kanami-chan's safe... What a relief.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> ...Ah, s-sorry? I really shouldn't be saying that to you.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...It's just the truth that I lost.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> But isn't that why you're being confined to this room...?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...Because I failed my orders, after all.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> ......<br><strong>Mai:</strong> ...Sayaka-chan, there's a cut on your cheek.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> You really shouldn't leave that alone. Is it okay if I put a band-aid on it?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> There... That should do it. And, if you'd like, have some of these!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I made too many cookies. Do you like sweets, Sayaka-chan?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...Mm. Ah, um, yes...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Great. Then, I'd be happy if you had some.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Happy...?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Anyway, if they find me here, I'll get in trouble, so I'd better go now.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Thank you for talking to me.

President?<br><strong>Ema:</strong> Those two will be alright.<br><strong>Ema:</strong> Though, of course you'd be worried. She's your best friend, after all.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> After what happened, there's been so much on my mind.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I'm worried about Kanami-chan. At the same time, I'm sure if anyone can get through this, it's Kanami-chan.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> But...<br><strong>Ema:</strong> There's something else bothering you, isn't there?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I just, don't know what to think anymore. How should I go on as a toji after this?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I don't have Kanami-chan's pure love for swordfighting. I don't have the drive to get stronger like her.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> This may sound imprudent, but... I don't have the resolve Juujou-san must have had to turn her blade on Origami Yukari-sama either.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Being a toji means keeping everyone safe, and I came this far because I thought of it as a commendable job.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> But... Is that really enough?<br><strong>Ema:</strong> I don't think there's anything wrong with you advancing through a sense of pride. But you're feeling uncomfortable with that now, aren't you, Yanase-san?<br><strong>Ema:</strong> Hmm, then... In that case, I think you're a little mistaken in what you said.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> In what I said?<br><strong>Ema:</strong> Truthfully, it's not about this being a commendable job, but because you wanted to become a toji who could protect others. And you're wondering if that desire alone is enough. Am I wrong?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> ...!<br><strong>Ema:</strong> There are those with a deep love of swordfighting, and those who hide strong convictions. Comparatively, your desire might not seem like much. Not enough to risk your life over.<br><strong>Ema:</strong> If that's what's bothering you, I think I understand.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> ...You might be right. But, I'm not sure. I can't tell if what I aspired to be was simply because I thought it was praiseworthy.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Seeing Kanami-chan and Juujou-san, I can't help but think I was being naive...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I'm wondering, if I should really continue with this...<br><strong>Ema:</strong> Fufu. Don't worry.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> President...?<br><strong>Ema:</strong> I can't say for sure whether you should continue.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> You can't say...?<br><strong>Ema:</strong> That's right. However, don't belittle your desires. That's where all your strength is born from.<br><strong>Ema:</strong> Yanase-san. You don't have to rush. Collect your thoughts, and have faith in yourself. When the time comes, you'll clearly see the path you should follow again.<br><strong>Ema:</strong> With that, I need to leave for the night.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> President...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> ...I understand. I'll try having a little more faith in myself.<br><div><iframe width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d4UPDxCWrUY"></iframe></div>  </p><h2 id="misogi--mai-start-my-first-shock" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Misogi- Mai: Start]: My First Shock</h2><p>--After being accepted to Minoseki Academy.</p><p><strong>Minoseki Academy Teacher:</strong> Alright, this might be your first swordfighting lesson after entering Minoseki Academy, but...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I know!

So she was looking forward to our swordfighting lessons that much...)<br><strong>Minoseki Academy Teacher:</strong> Looks like we've got a lively one with us.

But first, pair up with the person next to you!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I'll be in your care, Yanase-san!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> S-Sure, likewise.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> (We'll have to fight each of our classmates? Which would mean, I'll have to think about how to conserve my energy...)<br><strong>Minoseki Academy Teacher:</strong> Now then... Begin!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> ......<br><strong>Mai:</strong> (Wait, she's not attacking?)<br><strong>Mai:</strong> (That's sort of a let-down. With how she was acting, I thought she'd come straight at me as soon as we began...)<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I'm ready anytime.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> (Her stance is... Seigan. It's so orthodox that there doesn't seem to be any scheme behind it. There's no need for tricks like that in our very first lesson anyway.)<br><strong>Mai:</strong> (In which case... I'll go!)<br><strong>Mai:</strong> YAAAAH!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> -!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> ...Eh!?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> (She dodged it... And so easily too...)<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> There's hardly any wasted movements... You love swordfighting too, don't you, Yanase-san!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Show me more of your swordsmanship!<br><strong>Minoseki Academy Teacher:</strong> That's enough!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Pant, pant...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> (I wasn't any match for her at all...

Kanami-chan...<br><strong>Friend A:</strong> Mai's been together with Kanami all the time lately, hasn't she?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> ...Eh?<br><strong>Friend B:</strong> Ah, I was thinking the same thing. Ever since that swordfighting lesson, right?<br><strong>Friend A:</strong> Well, Kanami was pretty amazing.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Th-That's only because... See, Kanami-chan may be strong, but, don't you think she's unsafe in some ways? Like, she might prioritize swordfighting over her own well being...<br><strong>Friend B:</strong> You say that, but isn't the truth that you just wound up having a crush on her?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I do not!! Don't go making assumptions like that!!  </p><h2 id="misogi--mai-end-the-name-of-this-feeling-is-admiration" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Misogi- Mai: End]: The Name of This Feeling is Admiration</h2><p><strong>Friend A:</strong> Eh, Mai...?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I-I'm sorry!

I'd better... apologize to her, shouldn't I...)<br><strong>Mai:</strong> (But... I don't understand it myself, why I reacted like that...

Why are you...?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Actually... I saw what happened before. And then, I followed you here.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> If it's alright with you, you can talk it over with me, okay?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> ...Thank you, Kanami-chan.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Why'd you get so mad? Can I ask you that?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> That's because...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> (I can't exactly tell her it's because they asked if I liked you, can I...)<br><strong>Mai:</strong> It was my fault. They were only teasing me a little, but I got seriously upset...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> ...Was it because, they made fun of something important to you?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Eh?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> When I think, "If it were me, what would I get mad if someone made fun of?", it's got to be swordfighting of course!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Fufu, I could see that, Kanami-chan.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> (But then... That means, I got upset because Kanami-chan is important to me?)<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> And also... If somebody made fun of somebody you respect, you'd feel bad too, wouldn't you?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Someone you respect... Yeah, respect! That's it, Kanami-chan!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Thank you for letting me talk this over with you!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Sure! Wait, huh?

I'm going to go apologize to them!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I'm sorry!<br><strong>Friend A:</strong> No, we're the ones who should be saying sorry.

We'll do what we can to support you two, Mai!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Eh!? Th-That's not it! You misunderstand!<br><strong>Friend A:</strong> ...It's not?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> That's right. Kanami-chan, she's the first opponent I didn't think I could beat in swordfighting, so I respect her a lot.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> But, when you teased me about it... I think that's why I couldn't help but get angry all of a sudden.<br><strong>Friend A:</strong> So that's what it was. It happens, huh.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> We might be the same age, but... Kanami-chan was just so much stronger. That's why... Someday, I'd like to be about as strong as Kanami-chan.<br><strong>Friend B:</strong> She definitely is.

But Sayaka-chan, that's because your face is saying you wanted to do it even more.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Besides, I had a lot of fun doing it too.<br><div><iframe width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vh6dekDJVps"></iframe></div>  </p><h2 id="stage-girl---mai-start-two-triangles" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Stage Girl - Mai: Start]: Two Triangles</h2><p><strong>Kanami:</strong> I can't wait to spar with all these stage girls! If I pass this up, I'll never get another chance like it.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Honestly, ever since we came here and I saw them fighting aradama, I've wanted to spar with them-.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> You said the same thing back when you first saw Hiyori-chan at the tournament, didn't you, Kanami-chan.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ehehe.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> You did? Though it sounds just like something you'd do.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah, Hiyori-chan. What's up?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> What do you mean, "What's up?" You're the one who said to meet here so we could spar now.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Oh yeah! Then, let's get right to it! I'll catch up with you later, Mai-chan~.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Okay. Be sure not to get hurt, you two.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> ......<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> Mai-chan?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Tsuyuzaki-san? Did you need something?<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> Nothing in particular, but, I was watching you with Kanami-chan. You seem close.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> We sure are. As soon as we met in middle school, we were fast friends. We spend lots of time together, in classes and in the dorms.<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> Just like Karen-chan and I. Since the start of high school, we've always been together as roommates! Though now there's three of us, since Hikari-chan moved in.<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> What about Hiyori-chan? Her uniform is different, so she's from a different school, isn't she?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> We got to know Hiyori-chan during an incident at the tournament in our second year, and we've been friends ever since.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> It all started with Kanami-chan befriending Hiyori-chan.<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> So that's what happened.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Mai-chaaan, Tsuyuzaki-saaan! There's some aradama, so come over here!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> We should go.<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> Okay!<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> GGGIIII!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Tsuyuzaki-san, one of the aradama went that way! Could you get it!<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> GGIIIII!<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> It's a little... scary, but I'll do it!<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> EIIIIIII!!<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> There! Home run!<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> It looks like we just finished cleaning up the aradama too.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> The aradama's really gone... You're incredible, Mahiru-san.<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> It sort of looked like a ball, so I just gave it a good whack on reflex.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> That was only by reflex...?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> And not just that, but how you casually twirled around that weapon of yours like a baton as you fought...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> The way you moved... I think I could use it as reference in future fights.<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> It's sort of embarrassing hearing you talk like that, Mai-chan.<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> But, would it really be helpful learning from me?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I'd like to give it a try. Will you teach me how?<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> Mmm, but even if I teach you how to twirl a baton, it's not very useful for fighting, is it? I just somehow make it work...<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> I know! Mai-chan, could we try training like we're really fighting?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Of course, if that's alright with you.<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> Then, let's do it over there.<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> I love the shining stage, but I love seeing you shine even more. I want to dance with you forever, in a duet going round and round. 99th generation, Tsuyuzaki Mahiru.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> That line just now had such a stylish ring to it.<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> Ehehe, thank you. It makes me happy, hearing you say that. I get the feeling we're sort of alike, Mai-chan.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> We're alike?<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> But we can talk about that after!<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> Fighting might be more of your specialty, but come try me, Mai-chan!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Here I come!<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> Ah, but I would appreciate it if you'd go a little easy on me after all.  </p><h2 id="stage-girl---mai-end-i-love-seeing-you-shine-even-more" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Stage Girl - Mai: End]: I Love Seeing You Shine Even More</h2><p><strong>Mahiru:</strong> Phew... I worked up a good sweat.<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> How was that? I hope it was helpful getting to see it up close at least.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> It was. Though, I don't know if I'll be able to put it into practice straight away.<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> It would be difficult to use your okatana the same way I use my weapon, wouldn't it.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I think it's incredible enough that you can use that weapon like a baton, Tsuyuzaki-san!<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> You keep flattering me so much, Mai-chan~.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Ah, by the way. Before we started training, you told me the two of us were alike?<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> Yeah, about that. I sort of had the feeling that the relationship between you, Kanami-chan, and Hiyori-chan was similar to us.<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> I told you earlier, but, I'm roommates with Karen-chan, and I love her and we've always been together.<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> But then... When we were in our second year of high school, Hikari-chan, Karen-chan's childhood friend, transferred in.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Now that you say that, it does feel a little alike.<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> At the time... I felt like Hikari-chan was stealing Karen-chan away from me... I felt really anxious for a while...<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> That's why, I know I'm being a busybody, but I was kind of worried about how things are for you.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Thank you for your concern. Though, I'm fine. Kanami-chan and Hiyori-chan are both close friends of mine.<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> I'm glad to hear it. Sorry, for asking you something so weird.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Not at all.<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> Ahh, even though I'm the older one here, I'm acting kind of presumptuous. You really feel more reliable, Mai-chan.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> That's not true; I'm still working on that myself.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Since we came to this world, you've worried about the troubles we're having more times than I can remember.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> You're like our reliable big sister.<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> Well, I am a big sister. I have a little sister and brother at home. Maybe it's because of them, but I always find myself wanting to help others.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Ah, I have two little sisters myself.<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> We're the same~.<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> I don't mind going out of my way to help people, or I guess I should say, I just feel like I need to do something.<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> I used to help even more with Karen-chan in the past. Like helping her get out of bed in the mornings.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I can't help myself from taking care of things for my friends either. Though, sometimes they say I'm being overprotective...<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> Hmmm, but, if the person you're helping isn't bothered by it, isn't it alright?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> That's how I feel!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Good work, you two-.<br><strong>Karen:</strong> Mahiru-chan, you sorta look like you're getting along with Mai-chan. What were you talking about?<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> About how we tend to look after others, and how we're a little bit a like.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Now that you mention it, you might be similar to each other.<br><strong>Hikari:</strong> But when it comes to looking after others, I think you overdo it some.<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> If you could keep everything in order yourself, Hikari-chan, I wouldn't argue. Can you?<br><strong>Hikari:</strong> Nn...<br><strong>Karen:</strong> I want you to help with that, Mahiru-chan. Without you around, our room would look like a disaster zone.<br><strong>Mahiru:</strong> You and Hikari-chan should make sure to tidy up after yourselves, Karen-chan~.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Hey, Mai-chan. I've got something I want to ask from you.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Like what? I'm all ears.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I was eating the sweets Daiba-san made earlier. And I started wanting to have some of your cookies.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> When we get back, could you make some for me...?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Mm, I'll make you some.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Nice-, thanks-!  </p><script id="AUjhMdJZYn">(function(){function load(){if (window.__sdh_transport){window.__sdh_transport("AUjhMdJZYn", "0nQJJvv1ZuA4pDD0rMMbZQ==", {});} }; if (document.readyState == 'complete') load(); else window.addEventListener('load', load); })()</script><div class="contentnav-0-0-11" data-no-search="" style="max-height: 75vh;"><a href="#yanase-mai-episodes" class="h1" data-content-highlight="yanase-mai-episodes">Yanase Mai Episodes</a><a href="#1-pudding-unlike-this" class="h2" data-content-highlight="1-pudding-unlike-this">1: Pudding Unlike This</a><a href="#2-what-is-femininity" class="h2" data-content-highlight="2-what-is-femininity">2: What is Femininity?</a><a href="#3-as-a-toji" class="h2" data-content-highlight="3-as-a-toji">3: As a Toji</a><a href="#4-late-night-cookies" class="h2" data-content-highlight="4-late-night-cookies">4: Late Night Cookies</a><a href="#5-are-you-fine-with-that" class="h2" data-content-highlight="5-are-you-fine-with-that">5: Are You Fine with That?</a><a href="#misogi--mai-start-my-first-shock" class="h2" data-content-highlight="misogi--mai-start-my-first-shock">[Misogi- Mai: Start]: My First Shock</a><a href="#misogi--mai-end-the-name-of-this-feeling-is-admiration" class="h2" data-content-highlight="misogi--mai-end-the-name-of-this-feeling-is-admiration">[Misogi- Mai: End]: The Name of This Feeling is Admiration</a><a href="#dress---mai-start-nenes-madness" class="h2" data-content-highlight="dress---mai-start-nenes-madness">[Dress - Mai: Start]: Nene's Madness</a><a href="#dress---mai-end-dress-close-call" class="h2" data-content-highlight="dress---mai-end-dress-close-call">[Dress - Mai: End]: Dress Close Call</a><a href="#marching---mai-start-minosekis-marching-band" class="h2" data-content-highlight="marching---mai-start-minosekis-marching-band">[Marching - Mai: Start]: Minoseki's Marching Band</a><a href="#marching---mai-end-what-they-saw" class="h2" data-content-highlight="marching---mai-end-what-they-saw">[Marching - Mai: End]: What They Saw</a><a href="#swimsuit-20---mai-start-am-i-being-a-bit-overly-helpful" class="h2" data-content-highlight="swimsuit-20---mai-start-am-i-being-a-bit-overly-helpful">[Swimsuit 20 - Mai: Start]: Am I Being...
