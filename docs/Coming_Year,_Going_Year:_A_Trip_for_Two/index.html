Thank goodness! We made it to the train right on schedule.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Slow down, Mihono-chan! Honestly, if we missed this train, we could have just caught the next one. Why are you in such a rush?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> That&#x27;s cause, I get to go on a big trip with Chii-nee, of course! There&#x27;s a whole bunch of things I want to do, so I want to follow the schedule exactly.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah! That reminds me. These are our schedules for this trip. This one&#x27;s for you, Chii-nee.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> You made these yourself!? They&#x27;re thick too, aren&#x27;t they...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ehehe. Once I started writing down all the places I wanted to see and the things I wanted to do, it started getting really long.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Fufu. Well, thank you for going to the trouble. And also, this schedule is so detailed, isn&#x27;t it? You have what we&#x27;ll be doing divided down to the minutes.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I thought we&#x27;d get through every one of my goals for the trip, so it ended up being tighter than I expected. But, when it&#x27;s us two, where there&#x27;s a will, there&#x27;s a way! Right?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Well, if we go down the list, we might be able to manage it... But, don&#x27;t you think it would be better to relax a bit more?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> We can&#x27;t do that! Let&#x27;s do all of it! Cause we came on this trip together!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> (? Mihono-chan&#x27;s acting different than usual... I wonder what&#x27;s gotten into her...)<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Hey, we can do all of it, right? That&#x27;ll be fine, right, Chii-nee?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> O-Of course, so long as you&#x27;re happy, Mihono-chan. It is our last trip of the year, after all.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> ...What&#x27;s wrong? You&#x27;re making such a sad face.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah-! It&#x27;s nothing! Yeah, I&#x27;m just fine! It&#x27;s all alright!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Are you sure? Then, if you say so...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Oh, I&#x27;m getting a call from school. What if it&#x27;s about a mission... I&#x27;ll just step out of the compartment for a minute while I take this.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> She left...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Oh? Hono-chan. What are you doing here? Are you going somewhere?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Kiyoka! And Iwakura-san too! You too; what are you doing here?<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> We&#x27;re on our way to take care of an expedition assignment. Everyone else seems to already be on their New Year&#x27;s break, but this is our last work day of the year.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> What about you, Hono-chan? You&#x27;re already on your vacation, aren&#x27;t you?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah! Chii-nee and me are using our New Year&#x27;s break to go on a trip together, starting today. See, look at this! It&#x27;s our trip guide. I made it myself, and I&#x27;m pretty proud of how it turned out!<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Wow, that&#x27;s incredible! The schedule is packed tight too; it&#x27;s just dripping with your excitement for the trip.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It sure is. I think it seems like a little much to do in just two days and one night though...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Well, that&#x27;s because, Chii-nee&#x27;s going to...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah! Nevermind that! It&#x27;s nothing, so don&#x27;t worry about it! Okay!<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Doesn&#x27;t it seem like Asakura-san was hiding something just now?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It does. It&#x27;s like Hono-chan&#x27;s worried about something important on this trip...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ahh, while we were chatting, we arrived at our stop. Anyway, Hono-chan, have fun on your trip, okay.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Thanks--! You two take care too!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Chii-nee sure is taking a while. I wonder if she&#x27;s still on the phone...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Mihono-chan, sorry I took so long! I bought ice cream from the train. Let&#x27;s have it together.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Awesome-! Thanks, Chii-nee! I&#x27;ll dig right in...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Wait, huh!? The ice cream&#x27;s so frozen my spoon won&#x27;t go in!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Fufu, you&#x27;re right. It&#x27;s a frozen as ice. We&#x27;ll have to warm it up so it gets softer.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> ~~! So cold!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> !? Mihono-chan? You didn&#x27;t have to take a picture now...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> But, isn&#x27;t getting to see you warming up ice cream with your hands the kind of thing you&#x27;d see on a trip?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Honestly... Then, at least take it with the both of us. Just set it on a timer, and...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Oh, the ice cream&#x27;s melting! Mihono-chan, here you go.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Thanks! Ahhm!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Look, look, Chii-nee! It took the picture right when we were taking abite!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Wow, it sure did! You can see the scenery out the window too. We&#x27;ve only just started and already we&#x27;ve gotten a wonderful photo of our trip.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah! Let&#x27;s keep this up and make a whole bunch of memories here!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Sure!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> ...Ah! It looks like we&#x27;re here at the station. Mihono-chan, be sure you don&#x27;t forget anything, okay?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Here we are! In the guidebook, it says the locals welcome tourists here with singing and dancing, but...<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> Guooooo...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Aradama! For them to be here of all places.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> And our trip&#x27;s barely even started! We have to get rid of them quick, so we can make a bunch of memories like we planned on!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="2-its-hard-sticking-to-the-schedule"></a>2: It&#x27;s Hard Sticking to the Schedule!?<a class="hash-link" href="#2-its-hard-sticking-to-the-schedule" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> Phew, we beat the aradama, so let&#x27;s get our trip back on track!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> First, we need to try the limited offer mitarashi dango they sell at the station...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Oh no; they&#x27;re all sold out for today!?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Eh-!? But...<br>
<strong>Shopkeeper:</strong> Sorry about that, we just sold out. If you&#x27;d been here five minutes sooner...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Uuu... Just five minutes... If only those aradama weren&#x27;t here...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> There&#x27;s nothing we can do about it. Even if we are off duty, it&#x27;s still a toji&#x27;s responsibility to suppress aradama.<br>
<strong>Shopkeeper:</strong> Oh, you two were dealing with some aradama? Then, as thanks, take this. It&#x27;s fresh bread from a local bakery.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Whoaa~, it smells great. And it&#x27;s warm too; I bet it&#x27;s yummy!<br>
<strong>Shopkeeper:</strong> About that bakery, they don&#x27;t mention it in the guidebooks. It&#x27;s a special little place only the locals know about. Here, eat it before it goes cold.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Thank you very much. Then, we&#x27;ll take you up on that. Ohm...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Mm, it&#x27;s delicious!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> It really is! This is good! It&#x27;s nice and hot and fluffy; I feel like I could eat this forever!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Fufu, I&#x27;m glad to see you&#x27;re cheering up now, Mihono-chan. Suppressing the aradama might have taken some of our time, but because of that, we found something nice we weren&#x27;t expecting.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah, it&#x27;s all because the locals were nice to us that we got to eat such good bread. This&#x27;ll be a good memory too, won&#x27;t it!<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Hm? We ran into each other again!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Kiyoka-chan, Sanae-chan! You two were on an expedition, weren&#x27;t you? Did you finish that up already?<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Yes. We managed to take care of it sooner than expected, so I talked with Musumi-san about doing a little sightseeing before we went back.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> If you take the bus from in front of the station, you can get to a a lake with a power spot that&#x27;s secretly famous.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> For real!? That wasn&#x27;t in any of the guidebooks I read, but it sounds cool! Chii-nee, do you want to go check it out too?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Sure! Having a spur of the moment change of plans is part of the thrill of going on a trip. Let&#x27;s go see!<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> If we&#x27;re all going, then let&#x27;s hurry over to the bus stop. The bus only comes twice per day, so we have to be careful not to miss it.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> This place is that rare, huh! I&#x27;m getting excited; it&#x27;s like we&#x27;re going exploring!<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> Guooooooo...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Eh-!? More aradama!? This time for sure, I won&#x27;t let them ruin our trip!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Let&#x27;s all fight our best, to get to that power spot!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Here I go! HAA!<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> TAAAAAAH!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Pant, pant... No matter how many we defeat, more are appearing... This might be too much for the four of us...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Uuu... We&#x27;re running out of time doing this too-!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> We&#x27;ll be backing you up!<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Shidou-senpai!?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> And Tsubakuro-san too!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Kyahaha. Looks like I&#x27;ll be able to beat a whole ton of them here!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> EIII---!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="3-on-a-big-fun-girls-tour-together"></a>3: On a Big Fun Girls Tour Together!<a class="hash-link" href="#3-on-a-big-fun-girls-tour-together" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Chie:</strong> With Shidou-san and Tsubakuro-san&#x27;s help, we managed to clean them all out.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> But still, what brings you two here anyway?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> We were on our way back from an expedition, and just happened to be passing through. I&#x27;m glad we could lend a hand.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> It wasn&#x27;t really enough to satisfy me though-. And hey, what are those onee-sans looking all sad for?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Uuu... The bus that only comes twice a day left already...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It&#x27;s a shame, but I&#x27;ll have to come see this power spot another time. Sigh...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Hey, you two. There&#x27;s so many other things left for us to do, soit&#x27;s a waste for you to be moping around now. Let&#x27;s cheer up and move on to our next destination!<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Setouchi-san is right! There should be plenty of things left that we can do now. Like, if we leave from this neighborhood now, we can...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Nn? What&#x27;s that? That big book with all those notes in it.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> It&#x27;s the trip guidebook Asakura-san made. They were supposed to follow this and have a good time sightseeing, but then aradama appeared...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I see. It must be frustrating having plans this detailed getting spoiled like that.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Let me see it too!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Hmm-! I didn&#x27;t think there&#x27;d be this many neat sounding places this close by here.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Maki-onee-san, we should go see them too!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve got another mission to take care of, so I can&#x27;t guide you around. We can do it some other time.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh-, but, after coming all the way out here, I wanna play around some-.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> In that case, would you like to join us, Tsubakuro-san?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Good idea! I wanna thank you for helping us out, and it&#x27;s more fun with more people!<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Shidou-senpai, we&#x27;ll take responsibility and make sure she gets home safe, so please don&#x27;t worry and go on your mission.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Alright. If you insist, then I guess I&#x27;ll leave her with you.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Yume, make sure you do what they tell you, okay?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Hooray-! Come on, onee-sans, let&#x27;s go right now!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Wow, the stained glass is gorgeous. It was beautiful on the outside, but inside the building, there&#x27;s such a lovely old fashioned feeling to it.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> A bunch of guidebooks said you just had to see the stained glass at this church!<br>
<strong>???:</strong> ~~<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Huh? I hear some pretty voices singing.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> It sounds like it&#x27;s practice time for the choir. Getting to hear hymns being sung live in such a romantic place is a real luxury!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> We must be really lucky, showing up just in time for them to start practicing!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> That&#x27;s for sure. Our plans were thrown off due to the aradama, but we got to experience something this nice thanks to it.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> So, next is a cake shop in a studio up in the mountains. Even though it&#x27;s so far from town, there&#x27;s so many customers here!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It seems popular enough that people will come far and wide to eat here. Hono-chan, we found a really nice shop!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ehehe, we sure did! Still, there&#x27;s so many different kinds of cakes, and they all look so good, that it&#x27;s tough making up your mind!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Fufu, in that case, how about we split ours with each other? That way you can have double the cakes.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Oh yeah! Nice idea! I&#x27;ll have this strawberry shortcake then! I&#x27;ll give you the part with the big strawberry, Chii-nee!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> You can have the chestnuts off the top of my Mont Blanc then, Mihono-chan.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Those onee-sans really get along, don&#x27;t they.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> They sure do. Just watching them together makes me feel happier.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Phwah-! That tasted so good! Guys-, if you&#x27;re done eating, next up is a horseriding experience at a farm close by!<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Even though we&#x27;ve been stopping by one place after another, there&#x27;s still more to see? This really is a whirlwind tour.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Since we had the chance to go on this trip, I wanted to do as much as we can before the sun goes down!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I want to ride on the horsies too! Let&#x27;s go there fast, onee-sans!<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> Guooooo...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Hey-! Why&#x27;d aradama have to come out now!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> We might&#x27;ve gotten to see a bunch of fun stuff because aradama messed up our schedule, but I still hate them getting in our way!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Agreed; let&#x27;s make sure to defeat them now so they can&#x27;t interrupt us any more!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="4-enjoying-a-trip-to-the-hot-springs"></a>4: Enjoying a Trip to the Hot Springs<a class="hash-link" href="#4-enjoying-a-trip-to-the-hot-springs" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Yume:</strong> Eh-, while we were busy beating the aradama, the sun went down!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Uuu... After the horseriding, we were supposed to do mandarin picking at an orange farm, and then there were a ton ton ton more things I wanted to do---!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Mihono-chan, cheer up. It&#x27;s gotten cold now, so wouldn&#x27;t it be fine if we just relax at the ryokan and pass the end of the year together?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Getting in some hot springs and taking your time in a nice yet unfamiliar room is part of enjoying a trip too, isn&#x27;t it?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> You&#x27;re right, that does sound fun too, but... Uuu...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Don&#x27;t let it get you down, Hono-chan. We&#x27;re going back now, but you two have a wonderful stay at a ryokan booked for you, don&#x27;t you?<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> That&#x27;s right; didn&#x27;t you write in the guide all the things you wanted to do in your room together? I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll still have lots of fun from here!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...You&#x27;re right! This is no time for me to be down in the dumps!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Thanks to you onee-sans, I got to have a really fun New Year&#x27;s Eve~. Have fun at the hot springs, okay?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Wow, this room is so pretty looking! Getting this whole big room just for me and Chii-nee is so deluxe-!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Isn&#x27;t it? Let&#x27;s take a short rest here, then go to the hot springs. It seems like they let you reserve open air baths too.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Whoa-! I&#x27;m getting excited for it now! And dinner will be waiting for us after we get out of the baths, so there&#x27;s still lots of fun to have together!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ahh-, I ate my fill back there. The hot springs felt so good after eating too. I&#x27;m feeling nice~.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> So, uh, next on the schedule is... An end of the year card tournament with Chii-nee!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Fufu, you&#x27;re just full of energy, aren&#x27;t you.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Mihono-chan, the year isn&#x27;t quite over yet, but thank you for spending it with me.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Chii-nee... Don&#x27;t go saying it&#x27;s over or anything!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Eh? Why not, Mihono-chan?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah... Nevermind, it&#x27;s nothing. Sorry about that.  Now, where&#x27;d I put the cards...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> (What&#x27;s come over Mihono-chan? That reminds me, there was a time on the train ride when she acted different from her usual self too.)<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> (Maybe she was so excited for this that she couldn&#x27;t sleep last night? If that&#x27;s what it is, then I can&#x27;t let her push herself too hard.)<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Mihono-chan, come lie here on this futon for a minute.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Eh? What&#x27;s this for, Chii-nee?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> You must be tired from running around since this morning, right? I&#x27;ll give you a massage.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ehh!? You will?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Fufu, of course I will. It&#x27;s a show of my appreciation for all the fun places you took me to. Here, lie down.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> If you say so, then...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Ahh... That feels so good~.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Chii-nee, your hands are so waaarm.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Fufu, just lie back and relax.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Sure... Fuaahh... It&#x27;s like my back is melting; it&#x27;s too good~.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Haa~... That feels nice...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Fuah~... Nnn~... Zzz...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Oh, Mihono-chan? Fufu, she&#x27;s sleeping now.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> ...Her face is so innocent when she&#x27;s asleep. I wonder what she&#x27;s dreaming about.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> [mumble mumble]... Chii-nee... We&#x27;re going here next...! Chii-nee... Ngh...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Even in her dreams, she&#x27;s still leading me around. Thank you very much for taking me on a pleasant journey, Mihono-chan.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Yawn~. Looking at how happily Mihono-chan&#x27;s sleeping is making me feel drowsy too.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> It doesn&#x27;t look like we&#x27;ll be able to do a countdown to the new year, so I&#x27;ll just lie down and we can sleep together.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> [sleep breathing]...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> [sleep mumbling]...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Nn...?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> WAHH------!!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> (No way-! I fell asleep!?)<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> (What do I do now; we might not make it for the most important part of this trip--!!)  </p><div class="videoWrapper"><iframe width="640" height="480" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XL33MXyxw44?t=994"></iframe></div><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="5-will-we-make-to-the-main-event"></a>5: Will We Make to the Main Event!?<a class="hash-link" href="#5-will-we-make-to-the-main-event" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Chie:</strong> ......? Mihono-chan? What&#x27;s the matter? It&#x27;s still pitch dark outside...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Chii-nee, get up! If we don&#x27;t get out there soon, the first sunrise&#x27;ll happen!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> If you want to see the sunrise, we can do it from the window here, you know.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> There&#x27;s someplace I want to go with you no matter what though! I want us to see the first sunrise from there-!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> (It&#x27;s been on my mind ever since yesterday, but why is Mihono-chan acting so frantic? Does she have some special reason...?)<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Alright then. If you really want to go, let&#x27;s go see the first sunrise together.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Uuu, I was prepared for this, but it&#x27;s still freezing... Are you doing okay, Chii-nee? Sorry, for forcing you to come out in the cold with me.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> I&#x27;m just fine. But, look at you, your hands are all red. Here, why not use my gloves?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> If I did that, then your hands would get cold! I&#x27;ll be fine! See, I&#x27;m doing great...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Achoo!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Honestly... You&#x27;re pushing yourself so hard, Mihono-chan.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Here, we&#x27;ll each wear one of my gloves. And then, we can hold each other&#x27;s hands with the hand that doesn&#x27;t have a glove on. Alright?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Whoa! Your hand is so warm, Chii-nee.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Fufu, that&#x27;s better, isn&#x27;t it? It&#x27;s almost time for the sunrise, so let&#x27;s keep going!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> It&#x27;s getting brighter out. Are we almost to where we&#x27;re going?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ahh, look down the path! The first sunrise is coming up!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Wow... You&#x27;re right! It&#x27;s beautiful...!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...I&#x27;m so glad we made it. I got to see the first sunrise with Chii-nee...!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Mmhm. I&#x27;m glad I got to see such a beautiful sunrise with you, Mihono-chan.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Thank you for bringing me along.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I&#x27;m really happy I got to see the first sunrise together with you too, Chii-nee.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> But...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> What&#x27;s wrong, Mihono-chan?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Fighting with aradama took up our time, so we didn&#x27;t get to do half the things I wanted to...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Oh, Mihono-chan... Don&#x27;t you think there were too many things to do on your list in the first place? Why were you so desperate to do them all?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> That&#x27;s because...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Since you&#x27;re four grades higher, you&#x27;re about to graduate before me, right? And, when you do, we might be split up again...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> So that&#x27;s why, while we still have time together, I wanted to make as many memories as possible.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Mihono-chan...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Come here.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Wah, you&#x27;re making me embarassed, rubbing my head out here like that-.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Fufu, what&#x27;s wrong with it.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> You know, Mihono-chan. From now on, whatever path I take, the two of us will always be together. So don&#x27;t worry.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> So, the places we didn&#x27;t get to go on this trip, we can go see together the next time.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Chii-nee...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Fufu, thank goodness. You&#x27;re smiling again, Mihono-chan.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> I know, let&#x27;s make a wish on the first sunrise. A wish that we&#x27;ll be able to peacefully spend another year together.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Good idea! After all we went through to see this sunrise, whatever we wish for is gonna get granted for sure!<br>
<strong>Mihono/Chie:</strong> This year, and the next year, and every year after that, please let us stay happily together!</p></div><footer class="docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="row"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations/edit/docs/Coming_Year,_Going_Year:_A_Trip_for_Two.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_2_ui" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_13-_"></div></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"></div></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_35-E thin-scrollbar"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#1-on-a-new-years-trip-for-two" class="table-of-contents__link">1: On a New Year&#39;s Trip for Two!</a></li><li><a href="#2-its-hard-sticking-to-the-schedule" class="table-of-contents__link">2: It&#39;s Hard Sticking to the Schedule!?</a></li><li><a href="#3-on-a-big-fun-girls-tour-together" class="table-of-contents__link">3: On a Big Fun Girls Tour Together!</a></li><li><a href="#4-enjoying-a-trip-to-the-hot-springs" class="table-of-contents__link">4: Enjoying a Trip to the Hot Springs</a></li><li><a href="#5-will-we-make-to-the-main-event" class="table-of-contents__link">5: Will We Make to the Main Event!?</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Links</div><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://pastebin.com/LdyviZ8Z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Translator anon&#x27;s pastebin<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Site source code<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Built with Docusaurus.</div></div></div></footer></div>
