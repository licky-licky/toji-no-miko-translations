<strong>Announcement:</strong> After tallying the votes--<br>
<strong>Announcement:</strong> The &quot;Miss Five Traditions&quot;--<br>
<strong>Announcement:</strong> Who you have chosen is--<br>
<strong>Announcement:</strong> Tsubakuro Yume-san!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Me!?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Congratulations, Yume. It&#x27;s a little frustrating to hear, but I&#x27;m glad it was you who won.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yes. I feel the same way.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> To choose Yume, the judges must have a discerning eye.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> We should celebrate. I&#x27;ll cook a special batch of rice.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> <del></del><del></del>~Hooray-!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Thanks, onee-sans! I&#x27;m really happy right now!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I&#x27;ll let everybody in the world see a whole lot of what makes me so strong!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I don&#x27;t wanna!!<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> This has already been decided on.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Tsubakuro, Etou, Satsuki, Juujou, Yanase, Asakura, Setouchi, Yamashiro, Mashiko, Itomi.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> The above-mentioned top ten Miss Five Traditions contestants will participate in charity activities.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Your first task is to pay a visit to a hospital.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> But, doing that won&#x27;t even show anybody how strong I am...<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> ...What do the rest of you think?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> If going will help cheer them up, then I&#x27;ll go! Right, Hiyori-chan!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> That&#x27;s for sure. If it&#x27;ll cheer up the patients at the hospital, there&#x27;s nothing better we can do.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Visiting a hospital, huh... It sorta feels like we&#x27;re celebrities, doesn&#x27;t it!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Mihono-chan, this is a mission, so we have to do it seriously, okay?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I know that, Chii-nee!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> But, with you and Yui here from the investigation team, and Kanami and them too... It&#x27;s bound to be fun!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Mmhmm!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ah, Yukari-sama! I want to be in charge of photography!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Would it be alright for me to take candid shots of the Miss Five Traditions candidates!?<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Of course; I&#x27;ll approve of it.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Yesss!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> If it gets me away from suppression missions, I&#x27;m down for anything.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> A hospital...<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> If we made Mai&#x27;s cookies, would it make them happy?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Ah, that&#x27;s a good idea! Will you help me with them, Sayaka-chan?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> What about you, Satsuki?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> If it&#x27;s my mission.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> So, all besides Tsubakuro will be participating.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ugh...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> B-But, hey! I&#x27;m not interested in stuff like paying people visits...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> If the top ranking Yume-chan isn&#x27;t there, I&#x27;m sure the patients&#x27;ll be disappointed.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> ...You think so?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I know they&#x27;ll be!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> And anyway, I want to go together with you. Everyone feels the same, right?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm, it&#x27;s best if we go together.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> If you and Sayaka-chan say so, then... I guess I have to!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I&#x27;ll go along with you!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="2-she-likes-omusubi"></a>2: She Likes Omusubi<a class="hash-link" href="#2-she-likes-omusubi" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Yui:</strong> The casual expressions you get while traveling are the best!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Kanami-chan, Hiyori-chan! Bring your faces even closer together... And, smile!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Now that&#x27;s priceless!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...I was just doing what she told us, but does this actually count as a casual expression?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> It&#x27;s fine! Yui-chan, could you give me a copy of that picture?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Sure thing! I&#x27;ll give you one too, Hiyori-chan!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> F-Fine...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Now, who should I take pictures of next~.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> She just follows wherever her desires take her, doesn&#x27;t she... Was it really a good idea giving her the camera?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ahaha.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Oh, that reminds me, Yume-chan.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> About what, Onee-san?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Let&#x27;s spar later on! We managed to get all these strong toji together, so it&#x27;d be a waste if we didn&#x27;t.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I&#x27;ll do it!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> And not just with you, Chidori-onee-san, but with that onee-san too, and I wanna fight Sayaka-chan too.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> I don&#x27;t mind, if there&#x27;s time.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Me either.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Great!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ahhh, a group of smiling cuties is the best. Not good, my nose&#x27;ll start bleeding...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Don&#x27;t get yourself too worked up, Yui-chan.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Riiight, gonna plug up my nose with tissues.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> That&#x27;s not what I was talking about though... Honestly.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Ah, Yanase-san. While we have time, would you like to look over our schedule after we reach the hospital?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Sure, Chie-san.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> You and I will be meeting to be greeted by the staff. Everyone else will go on ahead to the hospital...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> It&#x27;ll be helpful having you with me, Yanase-san.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I&#x27;ll feel reassured having you there too, Chie-san.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> This pair&#x27;s looking good too! Seeing them so earnest together&#x27;s the best!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...Shut up, Yui-. Let me sleep in peace-.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Sorry about that-.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Seriously... [snooze].<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Alright, I got a nice shot!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> (I can hear everybody all energetic like that, and yet...)<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> (Why did I end up next to Satsuki-san!?)<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> (I mean, that&#x27;s fine and all! The problem is... How am I supposed to get Satsuki-san to lighten up and talk about something!?)<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> (I can&#x27;t just keep quiet; I&#x27;ve gotta try something... Where there&#x27;s a will, there&#x27;s a way!)<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I-It&#x27;s cool that the two of us got chosen for Miss Five Traditions, wasn&#x27;t it. I totally thought I wasn&#x27;t going to get picked.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> (Yes!? What&#x27;s she even mean by &quot;Yes&quot;!?)<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> (&quot;Yes it&#x27;s cool that we got chosen?&quot; Or, &quot;Yes I didn&#x27;t think I would get chosen either?&quot;)<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> (I can&#x27;t tell anything from looking at her face...)<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> E-Everybody sure is excited, huh!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> (I-I&#x27;m already out of topics... No, I&#x27;ve still gotta keep the conversation going!)<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> N-Nice, weather, huh...<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> (......Another &quot;Yes&quot;!? Help me, Kanami!! Let my thoughts reach you!)<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> ...?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> (Kanami!)<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> You look like you&#x27;re having fun with Satsuki-san, Mihono-chan.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> (They didn&#x27;t reach her at all!)<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Y-You think? We were just talking about what we liked...<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> (We weren&#x27;t talking about what we liked though...)<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Yomi-onee-san likes omusubi.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Right?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Omusubi are delicious.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...!?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> That&#x27;s amazing, Tsubakuro-san! You got Satsuki-san to say something besides &quot;Yes&quot;!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ? I can say things besides yes.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Thanks, Tsubakuro-san! I think I might be able to get along with Satsuki-san now!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> You&#x27;re really thanking me a lot... What were you onee-sans talking about?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Weird, the train just stopped all of a sudden.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> There may have been some kind of trouble.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> I&#x27;ll check and see.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> ............<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Everyone! It seems like aradama have appeared in the area!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> We can&#x27;t move cause aradama are getting in the way? Then, all I have to do is beat those aradama!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="3-i-dont-really-like-hospitals"></a>3: I Don&#x27;t Really Like Hospitals<a class="hash-link" href="#3-i-dont-really-like-hospitals" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Mihono/Kanami:</strong> Everybody-!

<strong>Kid 2:</strong> We saw you dancing and fighting on TV! It was really cool!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> It doesn&#x27;t feel too bad, getting a welcome like this. Guess we can do them a favor and show off a little.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm.<br>
<strong>Nene:</strong> Nene!<br>
<strong>Kid 1:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Nene:</strong> Ne?<br>
<strong>Kid 1:</strong> This thing&#x27;s cute!! Is it your pet, onee-san?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Well, something like that. You can go on and play with Nene.<br>
<strong>Kid 1:</strong> Okay!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Kaoru, weren&#x27;t you going to show off for them?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> I lent them Nene, so that&#x27;s already a huge favor, right?<br>
<strong>Kid 2:</strong> Onee-san!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> What&#x27;s up?<br>
<strong>Kid 2:</strong> Onee-san, you were awesome when you were fighting!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Thank you.<br>

<strong>Kid 2:</strong> I want to tell her what it was like too!<br>
<strong>Kid 1:</strong> I want to see you two fight again!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ahaha, now you&#x27;ve put us on the spot. What do you think, Yume-chan...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Huh, she&#x27;s not here.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Satsuki-san, have you seen Yume-chan anywhere?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> If you&#x27;re looking for Tsubakuro-san, she hasn&#x27;t been with us since we arrived at the hospital.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ...I will go search for her.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah, then, I&#x27;ll go with you.<br>
<strong>Kid 2:</strong> ...You&#x27;re leaving?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> As soon as we find Yume-chan, we&#x27;ll be right back. Just wait for us.<br>
<strong>Kid 2:</strong> Alright!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> She&#x27;s not here either... Hmm, where could she have gone?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Etou-san, I&#x27;ve located Tsubakuro-san. She seems to be in the hills behind here.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> We found you, Yume-chan.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ah, onee-sans...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I was hiding and everything too... But, since Yomi-onee-san&#x27;s here, she must&#x27;ve found me out.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I did.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Everyone&#x27;s waiting for you, Yume-chan! Can you come with us?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I don&#x27;t really like hospitals.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> ? Why don&#x27;t you like them?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I&#x27;m not telling.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Anyway, why&#x27;d you even come out looking for me? Don&#x27;t tell me... You were using me as an excuse to skip out?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Maybe I&#x27;ll tell on both of you.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Why are you only putting that on us!?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> We aren&#x27;t skipping out.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> The children in the hospital said that they wanted to see you.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Why me?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> They said they saw the tournament on TV!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> They saw how strong I was?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes.<br>

<strong>Yume:</strong> Well, what else can I do. I&#x27;ll go back then.<br>

<strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah! This alone makes me glad I got into the Miss Five Traditions competition!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Good! I just got a nice photo!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Yui. I want you to take one of me too.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Course I will! While we&#x27;re at it, let&#x27;s get Mai-chan and everyone in there too!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> In that case, Sayaka-chan, can I get a picture with you?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm, I want to take one with everyone.<br>
Elsewhere--</p><p><strong>Children:</strong> Yume-onee-san, Kanami-onee-san, Yomi-onee-san, Hiyori-onee-san, Kaoru-onee-san!<br>
<strong>Children:</strong> Thank you very much!<br>
<strong>Kid 1:</strong> Hey, hey, who beat the most aradama?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Hmm, who knows? Though, Yume-chan&#x27;s the one who beat the strongest aradama.<br>
<strong>Kid 2:</strong> That&#x27;s amazing, Yume-onee-san!<br>
<strong>Kid 3:</strong> Seriously!? Tell me all about it!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> You want to hear more? But, that aradama really wasn&#x27;t all that strong.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> It was a piece of cake for me.<br>
<strong>Kid 3:</strong> Ohh-! That&#x27;s so cool!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ...Tsubakuro-san.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> What&#x27;s up, Yomi-onee-san?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ...I&#x27;m sure that these children won&#x27;t forget your strength.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Even though they didn&#x27;t actually see me fighting?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Even if the person who saved them doesn&#x27;t remember... They still won&#x27;t forget.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Hmm.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> ...So these kids won&#x27;t forget about me.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> You did good too, Nene. You made sure to keep them safe, right?<br>
<strong>Nene:</strong> Nene!<br>
<strong>Kid 1:</strong> Ehh, did he though?<br>
<strong>Nene:</strong> Ne!?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Oi oi, what were you doing-?<br>
<strong>Nene:</strong> Nene! Nenene!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> He&#x27;s doing all he can to explain himself.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ahahaha!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> ...Okay!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Onee-san, this isn&#x27;t the time to be laughing, remember?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Huh?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I mean, weren&#x27;t we going to show them a sparring match?<br>
<strong>Kid 1:</strong> Ah! About that, we don&#x27;t need to see it after all!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh, why not?<br>
<strong>Kid 2:</strong> We all talked about it. How you&#x27;d be tired after beating the aradama, so we shouldn&#x27;t make you.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> You mean it? I was just thinking I wanted to show you though.<br>
<strong>Kid 2:</strong> I really did want to see it, but...<br>
<strong>Kid 2:</strong> How can I become a toji like you, Yume-onee-san!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> You want to be a toji?<br>
<strong>Kid 2:</strong> Yes!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Do you look up to Yume? I&#x27;m sure you can be a super strong toji someday.<br>
<strong>Kid 2:</strong> ...You mean it? Could I be as strong as Yume-onee-san?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> There&#x27;s no way you could be as strong as me.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I guess you could at least be as strong as those onee-sans though?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> At least be as strong as us, huh-.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> That&#x27;d make them a strong toji too.<br>
<strong>Kid 2:</strong> ...I&#x27;ll try my best!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Isn&#x27;t that nice, Tsubakuro-san.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Yeah! Being Miss Five Traditions might actually be pretty fun!  </p><div class="videoWrapper"><iframe width="640" height="480" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZYwru7GiMV0"></iframe></div><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="valkyrie---yomi-start-a-sudden-call-from-akira"></a>[Valkyrie - Yomi: Start]: A Sudden Call from Akira<a class="hash-link" href="#valkyrie---yomi-start-a-sudden-call-from-akira" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Akira:</strong> Oiii, Yomi! Here, over here~.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I could tell where you were without you having to shout.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> You just looked like you were kinda spacing out over there. Anyway, ready to go?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I was wondering where you were taking me. A cakery?<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> What&#x27;s wrong with that? The limited run parfaits this place makes get a lot of talk for being good.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> You still like parfaits like you used to.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> So, what was the reason you called me here for?<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> I had a little something to take care of around here. So I thought I&#x27;d give you a call. It&#x27;s no fun eating by yourself, right?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> I know you&#x27;ve probably got a lot going on too, but you&#x27;ve gotta take a breather every now and then.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I have to be part of a promotional photo shoot later today, so I can&#x27;t stay here for very long.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Huhh? What&#x27;re you doing a photo shoot for?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> You could say it has to do with the results of the Miss Five Traditions competition that was held the other day, I suppose.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Ahh, oh yeah, they put those out, huh.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> That reminds me, didn&#x27;t you place pretty high yourself? I was surprised to hear it. I never thought you&#x27;d be up there.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Though, it must be boring as hell to sit through some photo shoot cause of it.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I can&#x27;t neglect this, considering it&#x27;s part of my duties as a toji.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> You got so straight laced. But, if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re set on. You better do it right.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> You gonna be doing it in your uniform? They&#x27;d probably get mad if you wore something too casual; so a jacket like mine&#x27;s out.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> You&#x27;re probably right. Though, this time it&#x27;s arranged for me to wear a valkyrie themed costume, along with Tsubakuro-san and the others.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> What&#x27;re you talking about?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> You may not know about it, Akira, but valkyries were something that was part of Norse mythology--<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> It&#x27;s not like I don&#x27;t know what valkyries are...! I&#x27;m asking, why&#x27;re they making you dress up like that...!?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> That&#x27;s what I&#x27;d like to know.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Yeah, I guess... The bureau does say to do some ridiculous stuff sometimes, huh.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> ...Well, do what you can. Whatever you&#x27;re buying here&#x27;ll be my treat.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Then, I&#x27;ll have some tea. The black tea here is fairly good; it goes well with sweet foods.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> I&#x27;ll have the same thing you&#x27;re drinking then.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Ah, when you get the photos back, lemme see. Those&#x27;ll be fun to look through for sure.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="valkyrie---yomi-end-this-one-is-my-favorite"></a>[Valkyrie - Yomi: End]: This One is My Favorite<a class="hash-link" href="#valkyrie---yomi-end-this-one-is-my-favorite" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Akira:</strong> Yo! It&#x27;s rare for you to call me to hang out.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I got the photos back from that photo shoot we spoke about the other day.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I think they&#x27;ll be published online soon, but I had heard you were coming by on an assignment.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Cool; let me just put my bike away. Wait here a minute.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> So, how&#x27;d that photo shoot turn out anyway?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Like this.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Whoa-!? The hell... You&#x27;re looking way too cool in this.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> That sharp look on your face is great. It came out really damn nice.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I didn&#x27;t expect you to praise it so much.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Why not? Of course I would if it turned out this good.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> That&#x27;s true. Though, I expected you to make fun of me.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Yeah, if I&#x27;m being honest, I was planning to, until I actually saw this. This whole valkyrie thing came out of nowhere.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> But this seems like it&#x27;ll get some attention. Especially if Tsubakuro Yume and Kanami and the others are doing it.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> You got any other shots of you in this?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> No. This is the only one I brought with me.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> That&#x27;s too bad. I really like the look of this one.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I see. I wasn&#x27;t sure which photo to bring myself, so the others in the special defense team picked it out for me.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Huh. Didn&#x27;t think you were so close with them, Yomi.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Does that mean you&#x27;re pushing omusubi on them too?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Sometimes... I do.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> The omusubi you make are weirdly good, y&#x27;know. Somehow, just talking about them made me hungry.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> I&#x27;m thinking of getting something to eat here, but, what about you?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I&#x27;d like to join you, but I&#x27;ve already made plans.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> With the special defense team?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Guess there&#x27;s no helping that. We didn&#x27;t get to see each other much, but I had fun today.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I did too. Then, until next time.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> She&#x27;s working real hard for her buddies, huh.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Alright... I&#x27;ve gotta stick to it too.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations/edit/docs/Miss_Five_Traditions_Charity_Mission.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_2_ui" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_3DPF"></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"></div></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_35-E thin-scrollbar"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#1-but-i-dont-wanna" class="table-of-contents__link">1: But I Don&#39;t Wanna!</a></li><li><a href="#2-she-likes-omusubi" class="table-of-contents__link">2: She Likes Omusubi</a></li><li><a href="#3-i-dont-really-like-hospitals" class="table-of-contents__link">3: I Don&#39;t Really Like Hospitals</a></li><li><a href="#4-weve-gotta-protect-them-dont-we" class="table-of-contents__link">4: We&#39;ve Gotta Protect Them, Don&#39;t We!</a></li><li><a href="#5-they-wont-forget-about-me" class="table-of-contents__link">5: They Won&#39;t Forget About Me</a></li><li><a href="#valkyrie---yomi-start-a-sudden-call-from-akira" class="table-of-contents__link">Valkyrie - Yomi: Start: A Sudden Call from Akira</a></li><li><a href="#valkyrie---yomi-end-this-one-is-my-favorite" class="table-of-contents__link">Valkyrie - Yomi: End: This One is My Favorite</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Links</div><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://pastebin.com/LdyviZ8Z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Translator anon&#x27;s pastebin<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Site source code<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Built with Docusaurus.</div></div></div></footer></div>
