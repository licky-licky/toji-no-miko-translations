Mai-chan, do you know?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Since they've gathered up students from all the Five Traditions, maybe it's some kind of practice drill? Ah, Shidou-san came out.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> This may be sudden, but we've decided to use this period of your summer vacation to improve your command of tactics.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Given the nature of this exercise, non-toji students who are involved in operations planning will also be participating.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> With that out of the way, the subject of this training exercise is sports chanbara. I'll now explain the rules and rewards.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> You will randomly assigned to team of five, and designated to fight one other team. The winning team will be given complimentary pool tickets.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Mai-chan, we get to go to the pool! Let's try real hard!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Regardless of who wins or loses, it would be nice to all go have some fun together there. It's our summer vacation, after all.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah, that sounds good! But, if we're competing, I really do want to win.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Mm. I know what you mean!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> The basic rule is "You can hit anywhere, but get hit anywhere and you're out." Since non-toji students will be participating, you won't be using okatana, but these foam swords instead.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Also, the use of the combat abilities utsushi, jin'i, kongoushin, hachimanriki, and of course the sensory abilities myougan and toukaku, are banned as well.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> You're free to fight your opposing team fair and square, or sweep them with a surprise attack. It's up to whatever plan your team decides on.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Victory goes to whichever team has less members eliminated by strike out when the time limit is reached.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> However, if a team with a non-toji member is able to protect them until they end, that person will be worth double.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> That about does it explaining the point of the excercise.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Now then, I will provide some additional information to Maki-san's explanation.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Unlike ordinary sports chanbara, you will not be limited to a specified court, but only required to stay in sighting range of your allies.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Also, if either of the team's leaders do not notify the administrators by message at the start of a battle, the battle will not be recognized as official.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> We need to be able to start your fifteen minute time limit.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Lastly, students who are struck out will be forbidden from offering advice or other assistance. Right now, the rules that Maki-san and I have gone over are being sent to your phones, so please examine them at your own leisure.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> In a few minutes, the team assignments should also be messaged to you. Group up, and be ready for the training exercise to begin in one hour.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Hiyori-chan, Iwakura-san, Mihono-chan, Tsugumi-san, and myself. I think our team has a nice balance to it.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> With this formation of members, I can work as a support. I should be most useful that way.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I'm so glad-, it's all people I know!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I think you'd be able to get along well with just about anybody though, Mihono-chan.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> I've never really gotten a chance to do these sort of team battles with Juujou-san, but I'm looking forward to it.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Yeah, it's reassuring being on your team, Iwakura-san.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Then, why don't we decide on a strategy, or plan of action for our team.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> We get to fight all sorts of toji in these team battles... I wish we could do this kind of practice every month!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> You really look like you're enjoying yourself, Kanamin. It all starts in another thirty minutes, so let's have a strategy meeting.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Okay. Since it's an encounter battle, it'd be great if we had a way to know what kind of movements our opponents will be making.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> This was explained earlier, but protecting the students who are not toji is critical.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> As one of them, what are your thoughts on that point, Mizushina Kinuka?<br><strong>Kinuka:</strong> Before we get to that, let me give a little introduction. I'm Mizushina Kinuka, a third year in Ayanokouji's high school division. I normally work at the STT headquarters as a strategic staff officer.<br><strong>Kinuka:</strong> I'm not sure I can help much with the fighting itself, but I'll do what I can. I think if I move along with you, it'll be useful for reference in the future. Oh, and by the way, I'm a friend of Mirja's.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Good to have you aboard, Kinuka.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Nice to meet you-!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Don't you worry about having to fight, Kinuka-san. I, Yamashiro Yui, will lay my life on the line to see you unharmed!<br><strong>Kinuka:</strong> Thank you, Yamashiro-san. So anyway, about what Mirja asked before--  </p><h2 id="2-the-feeling-of-a-serious-battle" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>2: The Feeling of a Serious Battle!</h2><p><strong>Stage Directions:</strong> Somewhere in Kanagawa prefecture-- Two teams are in the midst of battle.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Kofuki-chan-- We've already gotten started fighting Itomi-san and Kaoru-san's team. Please get your foam swords ready!<br><strong>Fujimaki Minaki:</strong> That's right, Kofukicchi. It's a team battle, so if you don't help us out, we're done for.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Some aradama-chan'd be better than whacking each other with these squishy things... You guys'll manage.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Kaoru, do you not want to go to the pool?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> I do, but... Practice, work, manual labor... The moment I start thinking about those, my body gets too heavy to move... Sorry, Sayaka.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> But, I'll be cheering you on. You can do it-, Sayaka-.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I understand. I'll try to do it...<br><strong>Uraga Nao:</strong> You're fine with that, Itomi-san!?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Tch... Getting my ass kicked for nothing by Sayaka would be annoying too... Chichie, I'll pin her down.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Okay! ...Hey, and my name isn't Chichie!<br><strong>Nao:</strong> Mashiko-san, you get in formation too~... I'm begging you~.<br><strong>Kinuka:</strong> Let's review our strategy while we move. The basic aim is to protect me until we reach the time limit.<br><strong>Kinuka:</strong> Naturally, if we can have our talented fighter, Etou-san, keep up a relentless attack and match our opponent's offensive, I think it will likely lead to our victory.<br><strong>Kinuka:</strong> But it will mean you'll end up taking on multiple enemies.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I'm not too sure about that, so I'll have to think a lot about how to attack.<br><strong>Kinuka:</strong> We could also try gambling on a riskier strategy, like using me as bait so you can eliminate those who attack me. That might be effective if the enemy is hiding.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> But, the penalties are way too big if we lose you, Kinuka. It's better to keep you safe. That's twice the points for us.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Yep, keeping cute girls safe-- That's my mission here!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> We leave her in your hands, Yamashiro Yui. If you maintain a strong defense, it won't be difficult overcoming a numerical disadvantage.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Kohagura Ellen and myself will of course be in the area as guards, but there will be times we have to move out to attack as well.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> We'll be switching up our attack on the fly.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Yuiyui is in charge of protecting Kinuka. Kanamin is in charge of the offense. Let's all make it work! If we all combine our efforts, we'll take the win and those pool tickets before you know it!<br><strong>Kinuka:</strong> Remember, you aren't fighting with okatana, so it's one hit from these foam swords and you're out. Please be careful.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I go it! So, what are we doing from here?<br><strong>Kinuka:</strong> As you might expect... We'll go in with the element of surprise!!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Ooh, you're so aggressive, Kinuka-san!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> The opposing team we were assigned is Juujou Hiyori and Yanase Mai's. I think that is a better strategy than waiting for them.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Let's make like an early bird and go get the worm!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Even if she doesn't have an okatana, Kanami-chan is sure to come at us with everything she has.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Mmhm. From looking at their members, I think Etou-san will be the one to push an attack.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Yanase-san, Juujou-san, I want to make sure with you. Will the two of you be able to take out Etou-san?<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Or, at least keep her held down?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I think we can hold her down. Right, Hiyori-chan?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Yeah. It's just, I don't think I'll be used to fighting with these soft foam swords. Though, they should have the same issue.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> The moment you're hit, you're eliminated. You need to be careful.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Mihono, you'll be careful, right?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Why me!? Um... I think I'll be fine?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ahaha... I'd like to be able to go and play with Chii-nee and everyone at the pool!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> We have to win first to make that happen, don't we...?<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Hey now, having the right motivation is important too. Isn't it, Asakura-san?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah, that's it! Motorbation...! I wanna win too!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I think attacking as quickly as we can before they notice us would give us the highest chance of victory, but what do you think?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Our priority target should be our senpai, the third year high schooler from Ayanokouji.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> So then, we'll go with a surprise attack?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I want to fight Kanami fair and square, but we can do that some other time...!  Cause I want that pool ticket!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah, I spotted Mihono-chan! And Mai-chan and Hiyori-chan too!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Geh... Kanami!?  </p><h2 id="3-a-small-move-done-secretly" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>3: A Small Move Done Secretly</h2><p><strong>Kanami:</strong> I thought I heard Mihono-chan talking, but I didn't expect them to be this close by.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> It was so blatant that I assumed they were using Asakura Mihono as a decoy, but it seems I was wrong.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Fwhe!?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> So much for our surprise attack-. Mirja, are we okay to go?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Yes, I sent a message to the administrators that Etou Kanami has encountered the corresponding team.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> They're messaging to start the battle...! Yanase-san?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Mihono-chan and I will go after that senpai... [whispered]<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah, sure! [whispered]<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Yamashiro Yui.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> I'm already on it! Our hearts are connected, Mirja-san!<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Juujou-san, you take Etou-san. Ban-san, please back me up.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Sure thing-, I'll be right with you.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> That's how we're doing it. I'll be your opponent, Kanami.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> It's different from a sparring match, but this is fun too! Here I come, Hiyori-chan!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> (I'll draw Kanami away-- Good luck, you two.)<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I'm not letting you go one step further, Maiiimai.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Ellen-chan... Are you sure Kanami-chan will be fine on her own?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Fufu. That's a risk I'm willing to take. --HAA-!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Where do you think you're going? Asakura Mihono.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Um, uhh... I thought I'd play with Yui a little...?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> --Hey, Mirja-san!? You're going to attack without even saying anything!?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Mihono-chan, create some distance!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> --You're open!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> ...!?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Ahh-, two groups of girls meeting for a heated sweaty battle! I bet it smells great!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> And, out of everyone... Why are you acting like you're just a spectator? Though, given the situation, I suppose I'm one too...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> I thought I'd help you relax, Kinuka-san. I'm also at my strongest when my body gets all heated up!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Whoa-, Kanami-chan! She isn't backing down one step! Watching toji go at it makes me fall in love with fighter girls all over again-.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> --HAA!!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Whoa, that was close-...!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Think you're safe now...? YAA!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I'm pulling back for a minute!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I'm somewhat baffled by her dodge then... I was sure I was in her blind spot.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Maybe we should have expected it... Or we should come up with some counter strategy, shouldn't we.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> This is fun, but we can't keep it going forever-- Time to decide this!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (Now!)<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> YAA!<br><strong>Kinuka:</strong> ...Hyaa-!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yuii...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> That's right, because I'm Kinuka-san's knight in shining armor right now-. I'll punish any ruffian who comes near-!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Sorry, Mai. I couldn't finish it quick.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> We still have time, so don't panic yet, Mihono-chan.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Kinuka, can I borrow your ear for a sec? ...whisper whisper whisper...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Like that!<br><strong>Kinuka:</strong> ! ...I get it.  </p><h2 id="4-even-a-baby-tiger-can-still-bite-you-know" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>4: Even a Baby Tiger Can Still Bite, You Know?</h2><p><strong>Kanami:</strong> There!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Ah-, she got me.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I landed a hit on Tsugumi-san! Only four left!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Maybe it's because we aren't using okatana, but I can't get a handle on this... Though, it's no use saying that.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Iwakura-san, we'll attack her at the same time. If it goes wrong, I'm counting on you.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Good idea. I'll count on you too, Juujou-san.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> --Let's go then!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> You two are getting serious, huh!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> YAA!<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Sorry about this, Etou-san-- HAA!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> ...!

I got too focused on Iwakura-san that I couldn't react elsewhere.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> I'm going to go back up Mai and Mihono.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Mm, take care of the rest.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Hey, Iwakura-san. Would you mind... sparring with me with okatana some other time?<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Sure, if you'll have me. I heard about it from Juujou-san, but you really do love swordfighting, don't you.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Thanks; I just like to see how all kinds of different people sword fight.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Iwakura-san and Tsugumi-san got taken out...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> We're still okay, Mihono-chan! They managed to bring down Kanami-chan, so we still have a chance.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> (But, as for time... there might not be much left.)<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I won't let you come any further.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (Right now, I'm the only one who has a chance to go after Mizushina-san--!)<br><strong>Kinuka:</strong> ...!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Okaay-, there's no touching allowed here-.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ahh-, geez~!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Don't be afraid, Kinuka-san! Yamashiro Yui is always at your side!<br><strong>Kinuka:</strong> That's... still a bit scary in its own way.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> You'll have to deal with us first, Mihomiho.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Is that so. Then, let me join in, Ellen.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> We haven't found each other much before, Hiyoyon, but I'm not about to lose.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> So long as I'm standing, I'll protect Kinuka, absolutely!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> I don't feel like losing either. --HAA!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Oh! I should have expected, Hiyoyon moves so fast I can't keep up with her-.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Mirja, Yuiyui, Kinuka. The rest is up to you.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Mihono, if you strike that senpai from Ayanokouji, it's our win!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I know that, but... Where'd Mizushina-san go??<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Mihono-chan... Look out!<br><strong>Kinuka:</strong> ...There-!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Huh!?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Ah...! Yamashiro Yui... Guard Mizushina Kinuka right now!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> I-I'm on it... Mirja-san!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> That was way too risky; don't scare me like that~. Though, I love an older girl who can be a little daring!<br><strong>Kinuka:</strong> Strategizing does need us to be daring at times...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> However, it seems it was unnecessary after all. Having reached the time limit, this is our victory.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> No wayyy~, this is hard to swallow for a bunch of reasons!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I know. I never expected that Mizushina-san might go on the offensive...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I had no clue about it either-.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I wasn't aware of it as well. That may be exactly why she was able to strike where you least expected.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> She lives up to her reputation as a strategic staff officer at STT HQ.<br><strong>Kinuka:</strong> ......<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> We were doing fairly well for ourselves, but their strategy proved better in the end.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Right, at that moment, I was stuck on the spot.<br><strong>Kinuka:</strong> I'm happy for all the compliments, but the one who came up with the idea itself was Kohagura-san.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I was sure you'd come through, Kinuka.<br><strong>Kinuka:</strong> She told me that, when the time limit approached and the battle turns into a free for all, they'd never expect me to attack, so it could work if I came up behind them.<br><strong>Kinuka:</strong> When she told me, I was pretty shocked myself, but it sounded good for one last secret tactic, so I stuck with it.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> So Ellen-chan came up with it; that's amazing! But, I kinda wish you would have let us in on it...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Sorry, Kanamin. We had to outmaneuver our opponents, see. And that starts by outmaneuvering your allies.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Still, it doesn't change the fact that Kinuka did all the work.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I do understand the need to take a risk during battle to accomplish your objective. Though, the possibility that Mizushina Kinuka herself would be taken out was high.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Well also, I thought Kinuka might get bored just being guarded all the time.<br><strong>Kinuka:</strong> ...I thought my heart was going to stop, it was pounding so hard. Which was also fun in a way, but it helped me understand what those of you out carrying out our operations go through. You girls in the field sure have it rough...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Now then, let's all head back to school, so we can collect our pool tickets!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> There's still plenty more fun to be had this summer vacation-!  </p><h2 id="5-summertime-with-everyone" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>5: Summertime With Everyone!</h2><p><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ellen-chan, come see this!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I looked into it a little, and they have different kinds of water slides there! Wow, which should we try first!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Looks like they range from ones for kids, to high thrill slides that advertise the sense of speed. This one's the type where you slide down on a rubber boat, isn't it?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Ah, Saaya's here! Is Kaoru with you?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...She came with me.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Leisure's one of my strong suits. There's no way I was gonna be late.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Let's do all kinds of fun stuff together today! Mai-chan and Hiyori-chan and them didn't manage to win free tickets, but they said they'll be coming to the pool anyway, so it'll be a ton of fun for sure!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I'm looking forward to it a lot.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Did you get everybody together too, Mirja?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Yes. I believe everyone who isn't already here should have boarded the bus we arranged on.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Summertime filling your chest with anticipation!! Girls with bright beaming smiles! What is it about swimsuits that makes a girl so irresistible?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Do you think I could turn that in for my summer research project, Mirja-san?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I think it's sure to be rejected. Though, if you could somehow gather objective data, it's possible.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Don't go photographing anyone without their permission, Yamashiro Yui.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Of course I wouldn't do that! If I were going to take photos of anybody, I'd be sure to get their permission first! I'd want them smiling my way after all!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Well, if you'll be getting their permission, then I suppose it's fine...<br><strong>Kinuka:</strong> Ah-, since we're all going, I should've brought my little sister with me...<br><strong>Kinuka:</strong> Though, since Waka-chan's so cute, if she came to a place like this, she'd be hit on for sure... They can't lay a finger on my treasure-- No! Come within a 5 meter radius of her...!!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Little sisters are a thing to be treasured! That's the truth of the world!<br><strong>Kinuka:</strong> Do you... have a little sister too?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> I do!<br><strong>Kinuka:</strong> Yamashiro-san... Little sisters, they're little angels, aren't they? I can only thank god for making me an older sister!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> I know what you mean! They're made of solid cuteness!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Then, you two, shouldn't we try all kinds of fun things here now so you know what to do when you come with your sisters?<br><strong>Kinuka/Yui:</strong> --That's it!!<br><strong>Ellen/Yui/Kinuka:</strong> KYAAAAAAA!!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> YAHOOOOOO! The rushing water feels great, doesn't it--...!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Ahaha! We came shooting out of there pretty fast-.<br><strong>Kinuka:</strong> That was quite the thrill, there...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> That's what makes it so exciting!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Ahhhh... Sandwiched between two beautiful ladies, I can't take ittt..!<br><strong>Kinuka:</strong> Yamashiro-san... Are you alright...?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> You don't have to worry about Yuiyui. Anway, you two... Want to go for one more?<br><strong>Kinuka:</strong> In that case, why don't we try another one?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> I'll follow wherever you ladies lead me-!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> That's the spirit! The day's only just getting started, so let's enjoy it to our heart's content!<br><div><iframe width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eNoknnmG1eI"></iframe></div>  </p><h2 id="kanami-start-please-mai-chan" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Kanami: Start]: Please, Mai-chan!</h2><p><strong>Kanami:</strong> Let's go to the pool together, Mai-chan!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> You know about our next day off...? Well, it sounds like everybody else doesn't have to do any missions then either!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> That's a real stroke of luck!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I know! I couldn't believe it either.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> So, I was thinking, I want to go to the pool with everybody that day... Do you have any other plans then, Mai-chan?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Nope, I'm free to go. I'll look forward to it.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> We're almost at the pool!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> We're probably the only ones arriving here this early... Aren't we?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> It's a little unfortunate everyone couldn't all make it at the same time.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> But still, everyone will be here by the afternoon... And Yui-chan and Tsugumi-san should get here soon!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> While we wait for them, let's have some fun together!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Sure!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Though, what can we do with the two of us?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I'd be alright with just swimming, but... With two of us, it'd definitely turn into a competition.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> And also, that wouldn't be any different from PE class.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> That's true... Then, what about something like, going against the current in the river pool? Yeah! That could be a great full body exercise!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Aren't you just looking to do more training, Kanami-chan!? Didn't we come here to enjoy ourselves today?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah... That's just where my mind started going to... Sorry, Mai-chan!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> It's nothing to apologize over. It's very like you, Kanami-chan.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Come up with something good for me, please!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Fufu, I'll give it a shot!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Let's see, something fun that's not connected to training... Ah!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Kanami-chan, let's go down a water slide!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> We're starting off with a water slide!?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Yep!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I don't think many people will be on those this time of day, so we should be able to get right to the front of the line!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Oh yeah! Good thinking, Mai-chan!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Alright! As soon as we get to the pool, we'll go down a water slide!  </p><h2 id="kanami-end-a-heartpounding-water-slide" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Kanami: End]: A Heartpounding Water Slide!?</h2><p><strong>Attendant:</strong> Okay, the next person can come on up-. Are the two of you riding together? Or will you go separately?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Oh, we can ride down together.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> What should we do, Mai-chan?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Hmm... Since we have the chance, why don't we go together?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Sounds good!<br><strong>Attendant:</strong> You'll be riding together then-. In that case, please climb on board this rubber boat-.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> ...!!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> The boat is a lot smaller than I was expecting... We might have to be right up against each other.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> You think so? I guess it's like this?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Here, I'll ride up front!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> A-Alright... And, do I have to sit here...?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> If you don't sit there, how are you going to ride it down? Come on, get on!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Y-You're right... Mm, I won't be able to ride it otherwise... Mm.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> ...I'm getting on then.<br><strong>Attendant:</strong> Excuse me-, could the two of you get a bit closer together-?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> We need to be even closer!?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Sure thing-. You heard them, Mai-chan!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Ehh!? I-Is that really okay!?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Come on, wrap your arms around my stomach.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> A-Alright then. In that case...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> ...!? Ahahahaha! Th-That tickles, Mai-chan!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Ahh!? Sorry, I didn't mean to, Kanami-chan!?<br><strong>Attendant:</strong> There are places to hold onto the boat, so you can hang onto there instead-.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Oh, there are...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> We messed it up, huh.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> It's kind of embarrassing. ...Okay, I'm ready to go.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Then, here we go!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ohh!? We're moving really fast!! Ah, I saw Yui-chan over that way!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Eh, where at? Oh, Tsugumi-san is with her too!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> This feels like you could use it to train your kinetic vision, huh, Kanami-chan!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Hey, you're starting to sound like me now!?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ahh... That was so fun!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Let's go again, and bring Yui-chan and Tsugumi-san along!

You're so adventurous, Tsugumi-san-!!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I am not. Besides, wouldn't it be boring going to the pool with someone like myself?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Seriously-! I don't get it; how could a date at the pool all alone with a cute girl ever be boring?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> It's impossible to predict what will set you off, Yamashiro-san.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> ...Will anyone else be coming?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Uhh, as far as I've heard, there's Kanami-chan, Mai-chan, Mihono-chan, Kiyoka-chan...<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> ...That's enough. I get the gist of it now.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> So anyway, come to the pool with us! Or, is there some research you have to do?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> No, on Sunday, I'll be available.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Hooray-! Be sure to get an extra cute swimsuit ready for it, okay-!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> What kind of swimsuit did you buy, Tsugumi-san?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Just an ordinary one.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Did you really get a swimsuit just for this!? I'm so glad to hear it!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> There's nothing wrong with having a swimsuit handy.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> How much swimming do you plan on doing, Yamashiro-san?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> You think we're going swimming!?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> No wait, since we're going to the pool together, we should have fun with each other!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> But, isn't the purpose of a pool facility to let you swim?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> That's what school pools are for. But we're here to enjoy the pool today!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Enjoy it? ...I see, that is another way of looking at it.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> That's right! And to that end, I, Yamashiro Yui! Have studied the pool to perfection!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> What I recommend trying at this pool we're going to is the floating island attraction, Tsugumi-san!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> The "floating island attraction"?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> That's right! It's an attraction featuring floating platforms in the pool that you try to cross over while dodging obstacles!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> They have water slides and stuff too, but that sounded like the most fun to me!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> So you should look forward to it, okay?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> It does sound like fun, doesn't it-.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Of course it does! I was getting so excited about it last night that I could barely sleep.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> From the sound of things, Kanami-chan and Mai-chan got there ahead of us, so we should race on over there too!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> I just can't calm down anymore~. The pool is seriously like visiting heaven!  </p><h2 id="yui-end-this-is-what-i-wanted-to-do" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Yui: End]: This is What I Wanted to Do!</h2><p><strong>Yui:</strong> We've arrived at the floating island attraction! I will now explain the rules!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> The rules?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> The difficulty of this attraction is designed for normal people, but we're toji!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> That's why; don't you think we ought to make it more challenging?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> You have a point. If it's too easy, it won't be very fun.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> I knew you'd understand, Mai-chan!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> How exactly do you plan on making it more challenging though?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Are we going to cross it while doing a handstand?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> A handstand!?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Going upside down in swimsuits on the floating islands... Everybody's bodies wobbling around... Tsugumi-san, are you a genius...?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Hang on, wouldn't doing a handstand on it be dangerous? We have to set a good moral standard.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Ugh... If that's what your conscience as a toji says, then we'll just have to go along...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> So, like I originally planned, we'll cross the floating islands in pairs while holding each other's hands!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> We have to hold hands... That sounds like it would really restrict our movements.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Not to mention, if one person lost their balance, it would be easy for both to fall in.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> That should make for a nice adjustment to the difficulty, Yamashiro-san.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Sure it does; I racked my brain coming up with it. Tsugumi-san, you and I should be the first pair to go!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> ...This takes an even greater sense of balance than I realized... Whoops.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Watch out, Tsugumi-san! Come and lean your body into me!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Thanks for supporting me, Yamashiro-san.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> I should be the one thanking you hereee.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> (The perfectly legitimate reason I invented to press up against girls on the floating islands is a huge success!)<br><strong>Yui:</strong> (Ahh, this is bad. I'm enjoying this so much it hurts! I wish time could stop here forever!)<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Uhehe, uheheheheh!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> What's the matter, Yamashiro-san?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Nothing at all, just that the wonderfulness of the pool is getting to mee.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> True, I'm having a better time than I thought I would.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> ...Yamashiro-san, thank you for asking me to come with you.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Tsugumi-san smiled...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> (Wait? The mood here... If I confessed to her right now, doesn't it seem like she'd accept?)<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Tsugumi-san, I-- PHWAGH!?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> The water hoses have started up.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Did you really have to give me a cold shower nowwwwww!?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Yamashiro-san!? You'll slip on the wet platform, moving like that...<br><strong>Yui/Tsugumi:</strong> KYAAAAAAA!?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> We failed, didn't we...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> But, I still had a lot of fun.
