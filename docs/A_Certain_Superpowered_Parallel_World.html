I've heard you'll soon be helping with an experiment to create a new type of metal. Is that true?<br><strong>Misaka Mikoto:</strong> Ah, yeah. I'm surprised you knew.<br><strong>Kuroko:</strong> I didn't think you interested in those experiments normally.<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> Well, it's fine every once in a while.<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> (There's no way I can tell her I got roped in because this company makes collab novelty Gekota merchandise that they don't sell anywhere...)<br><strong>Konori Mii:</strong> What will they be having you do, Misaka-san?<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> They need a fixed electric current... They asked me to provide an electromagnetic wave. An especially strong one.<br><strong>Saten Ruiko:</strong> That sounds like it could be kinda interesting. Can we go along to see?<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> Sure, I think that'll be fine?<br><strong>Uiharu Kazari:</strong> Saten-san, didn't you say you'd be busy gathering gossip about that urban legend that there's a door to another world hidden in some school district?<br><strong>Ruiko:</strong> It's fine, it's fine. Urban legends aren't going anywhere!<br>Visitors (Gallery)</p><p><strong>Mikoto:</strong> HAAAA...!<br><strong>Ruiko:</strong> That's as incredible of an electric shock as ever, Misaka-san.<br><strong>Kazari:</strong> I wonder what the theory is behind creating a new type of metal using electricity, anyway?<br><strong>Ruiko:</strong> Beats me? I'm not all that interested in that stuff.<br><strong>Kazari:</strong> Then... Why did you go and say we should come along?<br><strong>Ruiko:</strong> Doesn't it sound kinda crazy that they're making a new type of metal? That's why, if we're doing it, I want to be there, you know?<br><strong>Mii:</strong> It's good to have lots of interests. There's nothing wrong with those kind of motivations.<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> It really is easier getting into the experiment having you all here, as opposed to being surrounded by people I don't know.<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> So, I'm glad you came.<br><strong>Kuroko:</strong> My very existence... Thinking of that as the source of Onee-sama's strength isn't so bad.<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> Kuroko... Couldn't you have phrased that better?<br><strong>Kuroko:</strong> I have only stated the truth.<br><strong>Shokuhou Misaki:</strong> Honestly... Thanks to you, Misaka-san, the static electricity is making my hair act funny. What a bother.<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> Shokuhou Misaki...! What are you doing here!?<br><strong>Misaki:</strong> Hmm-, just to see the sights?<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> Whatever... If you're going to complain, then just go. I have to do the main experiment in a minute.<br><strong>Mii:</strong> Are you two, "friendly enough to fight"?<br><strong>Both:</strong> It's not like that at all!  </p><h2 id="1-our-first-aradama-experience" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>1: Our First Aradama Experience</h2><p><strong>Mikoto:</strong> Ughh... My eyes are stinging. Is everyone okay?<br><strong>Kazari:</strong> Yes... I'm just fine. Are you alright, Saten-san?<br><strong>Ruiko:</strong> Somehow-.<br><strong>Misaki:</strong> Hang onn, thanks to Misaka-san, my eyes are still burning here?<br><strong>Misaki:</strong> Depending on if this clears up, I might have to file a complaint~.<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> How is this my fault? All I did was go along with their experiment to create a new kind of metal.<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> Saten-san and Uiharu-san are okay too, so you should be fine...<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> Actually, where are Kuroko and Konori-senpai at?<br><strong>Kuroko:</strong> The Kuroko you seek is right here, Onee-sama! And, just as you want me, I can be locked in your arms once more!<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> As if!!<br><strong>Mii:</strong> Shirai-san. Isn't there something we should tell them first?<br><strong>Kuroko:</strong> I suppose...<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> Did something bad happen?<br><strong>Kuroko:</strong> Your vision still hasn't returned to normal, so you may not have noticed, but... This isn't where the experiment was taking place.<br><strong>Ruiko:</strong> Eh... Then, where are we? Uiharu, can you look it up?<br><strong>Kazari:</strong> Just... give me a minute. Huh, I can't get it to turn on!?<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> Let's just ask someone around here then.<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> Excuse me--<br><strong>Screaming People:</strong> UWAAHHHHH, ARADAMA!? G-GET OUT OF HERE!!<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> Eh... Wait...<br><strong>Misaki:</strong> Maybe it would have been for the best if someone besides Misaka-san had asked them?<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> ...I didn't even do anything!<br><strong>Mii:</strong> More importantly, "aradama"? I'm curious what that means.<br><strong>Ruiko:</strong> Umm... This is totally just going off my intuition here, but! Maybe they meant that!?<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> ...GUOOOOOOOHHH!<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> Geez... And what's this, this weird thing! Let's go, Kuroko. Help me out.<br><strong>Kuroko:</strong> Of course, I'll be right with you, Onee-sama.<br><strong>Misaki:</strong> Do your bestt. It's times like these we need that barbaric power of yours, Misaka-sann.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> --What do you think about that? I think it would improve the circumstances of toji waiting for aradama to appear.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> I see. You make a good point, Yanase.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Sorry to interrupt your meeting.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Kitora? Did you need something?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> This information is still unverified, but we've received a report that a group of citizens are fighting with aradama.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Eh!?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> As time was of the essence, Etou Kanami, Mashiko Kaoru, Setouchi Chie, Shichinosato Kofuki, and Iwakura Sanae have been sent to the scene.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Ordinary citizens, fighting aradama; I can hardly believe it. ...Is there something strange going on? Just to be sure, we should go too.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Still, why would they fight and not run away?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Seriously; those're my aradama-chan.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> It's probably just some idiots wanting to test their courage. It happens every now and then.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Whatever it is, we have to get there soon!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> I can hear an aradama roaring. It's just up ahead!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Whoa, why's the air all crackly!?<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> GUGIII...!<br><strong>Kuroko:</strong> Onee-sama-! It's getting up once again!<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> Seriously... Just how stubborn can they be! I'm going to hit it one more time!<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> That's dangerous; please get back!<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> Huh?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> We'll take care of the rest here!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Out of my way! Those're all mine--!<br><strong>Kuroko:</strong> Er... Who might you be? You aren't from Judgement, are you?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Judgement? We're toji.<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> "Toji"? What's that?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> (...They don't know what toji are?)<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Putting it simply, we're something like experts at suppressing those aradama you're fighting.<br><strong>Ruiko:</strong> Sorry, we found a lost girl and took her with us, but what should we do about her?<br><strong>Mii:</strong> Also, we weren't able to access the database to check evacuation guidelines, and we were in trouble since we couldn't call for help.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> I understand. I'll call someone to help then.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Well, until help shows up, I'll guide her to somewhere safe the aradama can't get to.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Thank you, Kaoru-san. The rest of you should all hurry to safety as well!<br><strong>Kazari:</strong> Why is it that they all have swords... They don't seem like some special tool for an ability enhancement test, do they?<br><strong>Kuroko:</strong> Though, it looks as if they're telling the truth when they say they're specialists.<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> GYAAAAAAAA...!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Hey, hey, what's wrong? You're not gonna satisfy me like that!<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Etou-san, I'll drive them over your way!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Sure, I'm ready whenever!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> HAAA--!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Etou, Mashiko, Iwakura, Shichinosato, Setouchi. Good work on making it here quickly and suppressing them. And then... You girls.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> They're kinda weird, aren't they? They don't know about toji or aradama.<br><strong>Ruiko:</strong> That was so cool, the way you were like, whoosh, with your swords! Girls with Japanese swords just have that appeal to them, don't they-.<br><strong>Kazari:</strong> Saten-san, before you go off like that, we should make sure of what those aradama things were first.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Well, thinking over it, aradama are a sort of false organism created from a fusion of noro, I guess?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Without using the okatana we toji fight with, you won't be able to exorcise them. No matter what you attack them with.<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> So that's why they kept coming back every time I hit them with electric shocks.<br><strong>Kuroko:</strong> Still, for Onee-sama, the electromaster, boasted as third rank in Academy City, to be unable to defeat them...<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> There are still some people my esper powers don't work on... Very very few of them though.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Esper powers? You mean like, you can use telepathy or control fire, like you see in movies or manga?<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> What are you talking about? It's common knowledge that Academy City is working to develop esper powers.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Academy City... Development of esper powers. I find this hard to believe all of a sudden.<br><strong>Mii:</strong> Toji, and aradama... It seems there are many things we're both unfamiliar with. Perhaps we should start by confirming some things with each other.<br><strong>Ruiko:</strong> Ah, before that, shouldn't we do the easy thing and all introduce ourselves? If we don't, it'll get confusing while we're talking.<br><strong>Ruiko:</strong> I'm Saten Ruiko, a first year in Sakugawa Middle School! Nice to meet you! Okay, now Misaka-san!<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> I'm Misaka Mikoto. A second year in Tokiwadai Middle School. Nice to meet you.<br><strong>Misaki:</strong> Likewise, second year at Tokiwadai Middle School, Shokuhou Misaki. Misaka-san and I are verrry close~. Good to meet you all~.<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> Since when... Could you at least do your introduction right?<br><strong>Misaki:</strong> Awww, Misaka-san's so scaryy.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> So you two come from the same school. I'm Etou Kanami, a second year in the Minoseki Academy's middle school division. Nice to meet you!<br><strong>Kuruko:</strong> Then, I will go next. I am Shirai Kuroko, a first year from Tokiwadai Middle School. And a member of one of Academy City's organizations for maintaining public order, Judgement.<br><strong>Kuroko:</strong> Ah-! I can't believe myself; I nearly forgot to mention something important.<br><strong>Kuroko:</strong> I also happen to be Misaka Mikoto-onee-sama's roommate at Tokiwadai's dorms. Pleased to make your acquaintance.<br><strong>Kazari:</strong> ...Leave it to Shirai-san to go out of her way to let people know that.<br><strong>Kazari:</strong> Ah. My name is Uiharu Kazari. I'm a member of Judgment, the same as Shirai-san, and also, a classmate of Saten-san's.<br><strong>Mii:</strong> Then, it looks like I'm the last one on our side. I'm Konori Mii. Good to meet you.<br><strong>Mii:</strong> Like Shirai-san and Uiharu-san, I work for Judgement.<br><strong>Mii:</strong> Oh, and, come to think of it, I'm the only one in high school among us.<br><strong>Kazari:</strong> She's our dependable senpai.<br><strong>Mii:</strong> Thank you, Uiharu-san.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Then, we should finish our introductions as well. I'm Kitora Mirja, second year in the high school division of Ayanokouji Martial Arts School.  </p><h2 id="2-tamahagane" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>2: Tamahagane?</h2><p><strong>Mikoto:</strong> With my power, it's like this.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> That's so cool, Onee-san! It's all sparky and crackly!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> They really do have esper powers.<br><strong>Kuroko:</strong> Still, now things are finally clear. This may sound unbelievable, but... We've all arrived in a world without Academy City or esper abilities.<br><strong>Mii:</strong> I'm sorry to ask for this, but is there any way you could provide for us a place to live for the time being?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Of course. I'm sure you don't have anyone else to rely on, so we'll arrange a place for you to stay at the nearby Renpu dorms. You don't have to worry.<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> Thanks a lot. That really helps.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Anyway, Shidou-san. Everyone must be tired, so let's move over there.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Now then, could you explain what it was you were all doing just before you came here?<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> Just before we ended up in this world, I was actually helping with an experiment to create a new kind of metal.<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> And then, after I made electric current, in just 10 seconds, we were blanketed in this white light...<br><strong>Kuroko:</strong> The next thing we knew, we had been transported to this world.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> I guess what sounds reasonable is, this metal you were trying to make might've been the cause?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> What kind of metal was it?<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> Sorry, I don't know the details myself...<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> (And that's cause, after they said they'd give me corporate novelty Gekota merchandise... I got too excited and wasn't listening.)<br><strong>Misaki:</strong> If only Misaka-san would pay more attention to that sort of thingg.<br><strong>Misaki:</strong> That side of you can be so childish; it's a real botherr.<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> Wha!? Listen, you... I do feel a little responsible for this, but... Why'd you even have to come along in the first place!<br><strong>Misaki:</strong> Purely by chance. I just happened to have something to take care of at that research institute too.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Misaka Mikoto, Shokuhou Misaki. We are getting off topic. Is there anything else you can remember?<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> Ah, come to think of it, the metal we were creating, I think they gave it the temporary name "Tamahagane"...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Eh, tamahagane?<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> ...Wait, huh? Is there something about tamahagane?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> It might be a simple coincidence, but our okatana are made from a special iron sand known as tamahagane.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> It's a word we're a little used to hearing, so I couldn't help but react.<br><strong>Kazari:</strong> That sure is an interesting coincidence though.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Mind if I butt in for a moment? Looking over the report from the noro recovery team just now, there's a detail I'd better tell you about.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> From the sound of things, they found an unidentified metal mixed in with the samples of noro, though only in small quantities.<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> Then... Does that mean what I think it does?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> It's not at the point we can speculate yet, but it is concerning.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> In that case, why don't we have Ellen-san ask Friedman-san and the Special Rare Metals Utilization Research Institute to look into it?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> This metal mixed in with the noro might be just what Misaka-san is talking about, after all.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> It's best to leave what you don't get to the professionals.<br><strong>Misaki:</strong> What's the harm in asking? If they send it back to us, we can't do very much investigation ourselves, can we?<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> That's right; we'll follow any clues we can get. You're all okay with that, aren't you?<br><strong>Mii:</strong> I think that's the best option we have available now.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Then, I'll get in touch with her right away.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> I'll get the procedures taken care of then, so the noro can be transported smoothly.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> In the meantime, everyone, would you like to have dinner? With all that's happened, I figure you must be hungry.<br><strong>Ruiko:</strong> Ah-, that'd be great. I was starving, actually.  </p><h2 id="3-toji-are-highly-busy" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>3: Toji are Highly Busy</h2><p>Several days had passed since Mikoto and the others came to this world.</p><p>They offered to help gather from the aradama the tamahagane metal that their experiment had created.</p><p><strong>Aradama:</strong> GGGIIIII...!!<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> Don't go running wild in the middle of town!<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> Gu... Gguu...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> The aradama's movements have slowed. Let's finish it off, Iwakura-san!<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Understood! --HAAAAAH!<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> ......<br><strong>Kuroko:</strong> What excellent coordination.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Thanks for the help, Misaka-san.<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> You're welcome, but, I didn't do all that much.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> We're plenty glad just to have you stopping their movments. Right?<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Exactly. It buys us time to get people to safety, and it makes it harder for the aradama to fight back. You're a huge help.<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> I'm just glad to be able to help somehow. This much is nothing to pay back what you've done for us, so whenever you're suppressing them, go ahead and give me a call.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Thank you. Now then, it looks like the noro is finished being recovered too, so why don't we head back to Renpu for now?<br><strong>Ruiko:</strong> Ah, welcome back, Misaka-san, Shirai-san. You too, Yanase-san, Iwakura-san; good work out there.<br><strong>Ruiko:</strong> How'd it go? The usual metal collection.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> If I had to say one way or the other, it's going well. But, it isn't as if we're gathering lots of metal at once, so it could take a while.<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> I guess we have no choice but to go slow and steady. There's no use rushing it.<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> Though, the aradama... I'm a little surprised at how often they're appearing.<br><strong>Kuroko:</strong> They show themselves so many times per day. Working as a toji must be challenging.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> I'm sorry to have you two come with us to the fighting even though you aren't toji yourselves.<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> We're the ones who said we wanted to come along.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Even so, you shouldn't push yourselves, alright? If anything happens, don't hesitate to tell your onee-san here.<br><strong>Ruiko:</strong> That's some impressive broad-mindedness you've got there... But, you won't beat out Konori-senpai!<br><strong>Mii:</strong> Just what... kind of competition is that?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> By the way, what have you been up to there, Uiharu-san?<br><strong>Kazari:</strong> I asked the toji at Renpu to provide me with their data, and did a little looking into the distribution of appearances of aradama containing the newly created tamahagane metal.<br><strong>Kazari:</strong> Please take a look. It seems like many of the aradama appearing in Kanto match those cases.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I see; this is a discovery, isn't it.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Hardly any were found outside the range of Kanto. We should be able to collect these metals to a more efficient degree using this.<br><strong>Kazari:</strong> Sure; I thought I might be able to help out some, so I'm glad to hear it.<br><strong>Misaki:</strong> And I see even more appearing now. There really are too many aradama in this world of yours.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Which toji can be dispatched there fastest...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I'll go-. If I leave it to Kuroko-onee-san, she can get me there in an instant, right? I wanna try teleporting!<br><strong>Kuroko:</strong> I'd just like to make one thing clear, I am not an amusement park attraction, understand?<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> Don't be like that and let's get going, Kuroko! You too, Tsubakuro-san!<br><strong>Kuroko:</strong> I suppose there's no helping it. Then, let me see the location information of where they appeared.<br><strong>Kuroko:</strong> Now then, let's go. Are you two prepared?<br><strong>Mikoto/Yume:</strong> Anytime!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Hey, take me with you! ...Or they're already gone, I guess. Don't go stealing my aradama-chan like that.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> No matter how many times I see it, it still surprises me. These esper abilities.  </p><h2 id="4-whats-the-reason-for-why-they-gather" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>4: What's the Reason for Why They Gather?</h2><p>And so, by cooperating with the toji, Mikoto and the others steadily gathered the metals the experiment seemed to have created.</p><p><strong>Ruiko:</strong> Everyone's out on missions again today, huh.<br><strong>Ruiko:</strong> With the aradama showing up every day, it figures they'd need special schools for raising toji.<br><strong>Kazari:</strong> Academy City deals with some incidents of its own, but in this world, these are more like hard to prevent natural disasters.<br><strong>Ruiko:</strong> Misaka-san and the others must be working hard too-. Hey, the chocolate mint ice cream they have here might also be pretty good!<br><strong>Misaki:</strong> Maybe soo. ...Mm, this is delicious too~.<br><strong>Kazari:</strong> Still, doesn't it feel a little bad sitting in here eating sweets while all the toji are out working?<br><strong>Misaki:</strong> Uiharu-san, you're worrying too much~.<br><strong>Misaki:</strong> At times like these, the best thing to do is leave it all to those used to big flashy fights, like Misaka-san.<br><strong>Misaki:</strong> Besides, if we went to do something we aren't used to, we'd be nothing more than a burden, wouldn't we?<br><strong>Ruiko:</strong> And also, you're already helping out here and there yourself, Uiharu.<br><strong>Kazari:</strong> I'm not doing anything!<br><strong>Misaki:</strong> Neither am I, you knoww?<br><strong>Kazari:</strong> Ah, Konori-senpai came in with Yanase-san and Iwakura-san.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> There you are. We were thinking of taking a short break. Do you mind if we sit with you?<br><strong>Misaki:</strong> Go right ahead-.<br><strong>Mii:</strong> What were you three talking about?<br><strong>Kazari:</strong> About how, all the toji are still students, but they're so responsible. It has to be tough, going out on missions every day.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> It may be difficult, but this is just daily life here in our Japan.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> On top of that, exorcising aradama is an important duty for toji.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> When you all came here and saw aradama for the first time, you tried to protect the people, didn't you?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I think that's far more incredible. Thanks to you, I'm sure there were people who could get to safety unhurt.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Yeah. It would be normal for you to run away scared.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> So you were in here, Mai-chan.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Good work suppressing the aradama, you two.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> What are you drinking, by the way, Konori Mii?<br><strong>Mii:</strong> Just milk. It doesn't seem like you have my favorite brand over here, so I took what I found.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I see. I happen to like milk myself, but I never paid much attention to the brands I drink. You have distinctive tastes.<br><strong>Mii:</strong> They aren't quite so distinctive as you think.<br><strong>Mii:</strong> Anyway, did you find more of that metal during your work today?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Yes. However, it's still proving difficult. We seem to need a specific amount to meet our goal, and what we've found is insufficient.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> We got less than I thought... I know you must all want to get home as soon as you can too.<br><strong>Misaki:</strong> That's nothing for you to feel bad about, Etou-sann. The only reason we can get them in the first place is thanks to you toji.<br><strong>Kazari:</strong> That's right.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> This is...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Everyone, this is a request for aid from Setouchi Chie, Shichinosato Kofuki, and Mashiko Kaoru's group, who were accompanying Misaka Mikoto and Shirai Kuroko today.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> It seems aradama are gathering there one after another, and the situation is urgent.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Let's get over there on the double then!<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> There seriously is... just no end to them, is there. What's going on?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Business is booming today, huh?<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> I'm going to shock them into slowing down, so hang o--<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Keep it to yourself!<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> Huh!? What do you mean!?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> There's no challenge in playing with aradama-chan after they've been tripped up! You go help Chichie or something.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Come and show me a good time; gimme some fresh aradama-chan!<br><strong>Kuroko:</strong> Honestly, what is her problem? Refusing Onee-sama's assistance like that.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Sorry about her. She just really loves fighting aradama is all...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> I'd be glad for anything you can do to make things easier. Just keep making 'em sit still over here, Mikoto.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> And then Chie'll take care of them all.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> You'll be helping too, Kaoru-san.<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> Then, this'll sting--<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> ......!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> These ones are still squirming around.<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> ...I'll pay them a visit then!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Alright, until Kanami and them get here, I guess I'll work a little.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> --KIEEEEEE!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> If you could please keep it coming, just like that. --SEII!<br><strong>Kuroko:</strong> Despite all her talk of skipping out, she does her job well, doesn't she.<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> ...And now, more showed up? If I just have to keep doing this, then...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> It isn't normally like this though... I wonder why.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Kuroko-. If you think things're looking rough, take Mikoto and get out of here right away-.<br><strong>Kuroko:</strong> I would do that regardless. Onee-sama's safety is my top priority.<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> HAAAAAAAH!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Oh, good timing! Mai-chan, let's finish them off!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Sure. I'll be with you! --SEEEI!<br><strong>Kuroko:</strong> Those two harmonize almost as well as Onee-sama and myself. As if they can read each other's minds.<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> You're not wrong. At least, about the part where they're in sync.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> They truly are gathering here... Shichinosato Kofuki must be overjoyed at the situation, but where is she?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Agh, why'd you guys come out here. Don't go taking my aradama-chan from me.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> You don't get a say in this. We'll all wipe them out at once. That's the most reliable way.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Sorry, but it'd help if you lent us your power, Misaka.<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> Sure, you got it.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Well, it's not like it's that different for me whether the aradama get stopped or they're still moving-.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> With Yume-chan here, we've got the strength of a hundred people. Though, I'm not about to get outdone!<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> As you'd guess, after all the aradama we defeated today, we managed to collect a lot of tamahagane.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Though, why were those aradama appearing around Setouchi-san and the others, anyway?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Did anything different from usual happen?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Nah, nothing I can think of. Right?<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> I can't think of anything either. I just gave my support like I always do.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Big news, I have big news!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Ellen-chan? What's going on?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Here's the story: we've found out something about this newly created tamahagane metal!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> It seems like, if you apply a fixed electromagnetic wave to it, it becomes easy to bond the metals together!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Though, we don't know if this is the result of it being created from an applied electric current, or if it had these properties from the beginning.<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> An electromagnetic wave?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Oi... Don't tell me.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> If there's aradama with that metal in them nearby, that won't make them come running, will it?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Since we haven't investigated these aradama themselves, I can't say either way. But, I think there's a possibility. Since it was incorporated into the aradama, it must have kind of effect.<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> Then, the reason they kept gathering together today was because...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Cause Biribiri-onee-san was calling them all there?<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> C-Come to think of it... I was firing off electricity harder than usual, because there weren't many people nearby.<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> ...Is that what caused it!?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Hmm hmm, I do think this is a very interesting case.<br><strong>Mii:</strong> So long as we gathered lots as well, it all turned out alright, Misaka-san.<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> That's true, but... When I think of my own power causing trouble...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> This is just a layman's opinion, but, if Misaka's elecric shocks are gathering the aradama, could we not use that to bring them all to one place?<br><strong>Ruiko:</strong> That's it! I think that's a great idea!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> That might make dealing with this easier. If all goes well, we can could finish this up in one shot.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> If we take out all the aradama gathered there at once, it'll mean Misaka-san and the others can go home sooner.<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> None of us object to that. Right?<br><strong>Kazari:</strong> I think it's a good plan.<br><strong>Misaki:</strong> It seems like Misaka-san is the cause of lots of problems, so you'll have to work hard enough to make up for it.<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> You don't have to chime in on every little thing... You're not doing anything either.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> It'd be best to get this taken care of as soon as we can. Tomorrow, we'll start preparing to carry out the operation.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Kitora, Yanase, Iwakura, and Setouchi, I want you working together on the strategy.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> The rest of you are dismissed. Rest up for tomorrow!  </p><h2 id="5-steel-a-flash-of-light-and-a-twist-of-fate" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>5: Steel, a Flash of Light, and a Twist of Fate</h2><p>The following day--</p><p><strong>Kanami:</strong> Misaka-san, are you nervous?<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> No, not particularly. Ah, not to make it sound like I haven't been thinking this through...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I get it. I know how much you've been helping us suppress aradama this whole time.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> We'll pull this off for sure; today's operation.<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> Of course!<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> Do you know where we're doing it? I think it'd be good to be someplace like yesterday, out in the mountains where there aren't many people around.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> We do too. The plan is to have Misaka-san fire off her electricity and call the aradama to a place with little people nearby.<br><strong>Mii:</strong> That would be the best strategy for avoiding casualties.<br><strong>Ruiko:</strong> Wah!? Th-That surprised me...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Oh no... It looks like there's multiple appearances of aradama! These readings, they're increasing little by little?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> The site isn't far. All toji here will leave straight away. Misaka, it'd help if you came with us, just to be safe.<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> That's what I planned on from the start. Let's hurry! --Come on, Kuroko!<br><strong>Kuroko:</strong> Of course, Onee-sama!<br><strong>Kazari:</strong> ...Wait? Isn't this place where the aradama are appearing... It's right near where we first came to this world, isn't it?<br><strong>Ruiko:</strong> Eh, weren't there a lot of people walking around there? ...Is this going to be okay?<br><strong>Misaki:</strong> Hmmm.<br><strong>Misaki:</strong> You knoww, since this might be the last time and alll, what do you think about going to take a look?<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> GUOOOOOOOO!!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> What's going on here? Today's aradama-chan are biting at the bit! There's loads of 'em too!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> This isn't good... Evacuations haven't been fully completed yet. As things are now, the civilians will come under attack... Shichinosato Kofuki, Setouchi Chie, hold off that large aradama!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Leave it all to me!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> You're going to take care of the evacuations, right, Mirja-san? We'll handle things here.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> It would be too optimistic to think aradama wouldn't approach civilians in the process of evacuating, after all.<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> Can I suggest something? What if Kuroko and I go around hitting the aradama one by one with my electricity, and Shidou-san and everyone follows along taking them out?<br><strong>Kuroko:</strong> It can give you some time to help lead the evacuations. Onee-sama and I should be able to do that much.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> I hate to put you two in such a dangerous role, but could I ask you to do that?<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> I know, just leave it to me. Help me out here, Kuroko!<br><strong>Kuroko:</strong> I can't say I don't object to you diving into danger, but you've always been one to take action at times like these, Onee-sama.<br><strong>Kuroko:</strong> Then, if you'd give me your hand.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> We'll take care of what we need to also.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> I know, there's one thing we have to make sure of. We can't let any of the civilians to get hurt...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Let's eliminate the aradama. Quickly!<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> Take some of this--!<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> Gu... Ggu...!<br><strong>Kuroko:</strong> Well done. Then, on to the next.<br><strong>Kuroko:</strong> My positioning could steal one's heart, if I say so myself. Now, Onee-sama--<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> Gg... Ggg...!<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> Kuroko, next!<br><strong>Ruiko:</strong> Misaka-san and Shirai-san are incredible out there, but Etou-san, Tsubakuro-san, and Shidou-san are pretty amazing too... ...They're taking out aradama left and right!<br><strong>Kazari:</strong> Still, there's some people who haven't evacuated yet... Is there anything we can do to lend a hand?<br><strong>Mii:</strong> I think we should try not to get in their way, but I understand how you feel. Should we go ask to see if we can help a little?<br><strong>Kazari:</strong> Alright...!<br><strong>Ruiko:</strong> There they go. I should go with. What about you, Shokuhou-san?<br><strong>Ruiko:</strong> ...Wait, what're you taking out your remote for?<br><strong>Misaki:</strong> Just a little somethingg.<br><strong>Misaki:</strong> I myself plan on getting to safetyy, but, more importantly, won't those two leave you behind if you don't hurry?<br><strong>Ruiko:</strong> Ah! Wait up-. Uiharu-, Konori-senpai-.<br><strong>Misaki:</strong> And, beep. With that--<br><strong>Misaki:</strong> (By altering the memories of the people here juuust a little, so that they leave immediately, it should speed up the evacuations, shouldn't it?)<br><strong>Misaki:</strong> Now it's up to Misaka-san to go at it like a workhorse.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> It looks like they've finished up evacuating, but with more and more aradama coming, can you really keep up with this!?<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> I'll be fine. Though... We need to do something about them.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Looking at the the spectrum finder, the aradama detected in the area... all seem to be gathering around Misaka-san.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> At this rate, it'll turn out just like that operation we were setting up today.<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> ...Still, we'll just have to go along with it. I don't think we can try taking the them somewhere else at this point. If they're coming to me, we'll use that and finish them all off at once.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> You're saying you can take care of this many of them!? Seriously...? That's crazy.<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> I have a secret weapon. I'll make sure to aim it off in the sky, so it should be safe.<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> But this could be a little dangerous for all you toji, so stand back.<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> I'm going to put an end to all the mess you're causing. ...This is me at... FULL POWERRRR!!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> A-Amazing...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> But hey, doesn't it look like they're all turning into one big aradama!?<br><strong>Aradama Roar:</strong> GUOOOOOOOOONN!!<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> Ah...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Ellen said the metal'd bond together, but I didn't think that meant the aradama would too...<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> Is this going to be okay...?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> It shouldn't be a problem for us. You did a great job. Thanks.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Yeah, yeah. To pay you back for that, I'll let you see what makes me so great now~.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> You just sit back and watch, Biribiri-onee-san!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> I don't get to see aradama-chan like this all that much. Damn... I'm getting goosebumps!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Heh, it's only at moments like this I can depend on your enthusiasm, Shichinosato Kofuki.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Kofuki-chan gets so lively at times like these, doesn't she?<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> If we just handle this like we usually do, it should be fine.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Mmhm. We just need to pool our strength--<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> We can do this, everyone! Let's go!<br>After supressing the aradama--</p><p><strong>Mai:</strong> We managed to gather lots of that metal, but, will Misaka-san and the others really be able to get home with this?<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> To be honest, I'm not sure. Though, it's not like we'll get anywhere if we don't give it a shot.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Grandpa said we should aim to get as much of the newly created tamahagane metal that would be needed to make one okatana. We have just enough!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Besides, if we just kept on picking up metal, who knows when it'd end.<br><strong>Misaki:</strong> We don't know just how much of this metal came over here with us in the first placee.<br><strong>Ruiko:</strong> Now that you mention it, this could be the end of our parallel world lifestyle here, huhh.<br><strong>Kazari:</strong> At least be happy that we could get to go back home-.<br><strong>Kazari:</strong> Though, I would have liked to have eaten more of the B-grade gourmet Iwakura-san showed me about.<br><strong>Ruiko:</strong> So you feel the same, Uiharu-!<br><strong>Ruiko:</strong> I wanted to look more into rumors and things unique to this world too. Who gets chances at stuff like this.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ahaha, you onee-sans are funny!<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> It's a shame we can't say we'll do that next time, but I'm glad to hear it got your interest.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> What do we need to do in order to replicate the experiment that will send you home?<br><strong>Mii:</strong> When we arrived, Misaka-san sent out a strong electric current, so doesn't it seem possible doing the same thing might have the same effect?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> If it doesn't work, we can figure something out then.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> And if it does, it might really mean goodbye. Ah, I shouldn't say "might", should I.<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> Yeah. We caused you a lot of trouble, but tha--<br><strong>Kuroko:</strong> Ahh... Once Onee-sama and I return to our love nest, we can start with a gentle hug and passionate kiss.<br><strong>Kuroko:</strong> And then, Onee-sama and I will, ahhhn--!!<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> K-Kuroko! Don't go causing a misunderstanding... saying things like that at a time like this!<br><strong>Kuroko:</strong> Calling it a misunderstanding is too too much... And after, ever since we came to this world, I've been refraining from our everyday skinship; you're heartless, Onee-sama!<br><strong>Kuroko:</strong> I can't... I can't stand it any longer, Onee-samaaahhn!<br><strong>Mii:</strong> In its own way, things are already back to normal.<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> I told you, get off of me!<br><strong>Ruiko:</strong> Doesn't this kind of feel like how it was like when we first came here?<br><strong>Misaki:</strong> That's truee. This feels like it really could be goodbye.<br><strong>Kazari:</strong> All of you toji should get away, quick! Just to be safe!<br><strong>Mii:</strong> Thank you so much, for all the accomodations you gave us.<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> Aghh, come on! I wish I could've given a proper goodbye at least... Thanks for everything. We won't forget about you--<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Stay safe-! Or, they're already gone, huh.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> I wonder if they managed to make it home okay.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> There's not much point in asking that, is there? We can't make sure either way.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Tsubakuro-san isn't wrong. But we can at least pray for their safe return.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Still, esper powers, huh-. There might be all kinds of worlds out there that we just don't know about.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah! They really were unbelievable people.  </p><h2 id="6-what-do-we-need-to-do-to-get-home" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>6: What Do We Need to Do to Get Home?</h2><p><strong>Kanami:</strong> Shidou-san. I brought Mikasa-san and everyone-.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Thanks. I'll get straight to the point then.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> I'm sure you can all imagine why I've BROUGHT you here. The investigation into this metal found among the noro has made progress.<br><strong>Ruiko:</strong> Then, you found something out?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Kohagura, can I leave the explanation to you?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Understood! Nice to meet you, I'm Kohagura Ellen. Let's all get along, okay!<br><strong>Ruiko:</strong> Wow-, check it out, Uiharu. She's huge.<br><strong>Kazari:</strong> You know you shouldn't do that... Even if you're thinking it, don't say it.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Ellen-chan is the granddaughter of Dr. Friedman, the man investigating this metal, and she got us in touch with their research institute.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> First, I'll share what we've learned.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> According to Grandpa and the Special Rare Metals Utilization Research Institute, although this metal is being found in the noro, it did not exist in our world beforehand.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Although it's similar in composition to Tamahagane, it is a different metal. Even with the same volume, it's slightly lighter, for example.<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> If it's a different metal, then that means it did come with us from our world...?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I think there's a good chance of that.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Of course, it's also possible that it was created at the point you all arrived here, for some still unknown reason.<br><strong>Mii:</strong> It seems clear that the tamahagane created from the experiment Misaka-san helped with is something brand new.<br><strong>Kuroko:</strong> Though, that much won't help us find a means of going back to our own world.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Oi, Ellen. How about you tell them the theory you were talking about before?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I guess I should. This isn't confirmed yet, but we have a hypothesis about our world, your world, and what caused them to be linked together.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> According to Grandpa, this metal, which closely resembles tamahagane, may have been a catalyst for going through the netherworld to here.<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> So, if we came here through the netherworld, how would we go about getting back home?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> If we assume that the tamahagane you tried to create also exists in your original world, if we try to form the same tamahagane here, then--<br><strong>Kazari:</strong> You mean, the same thing that happened when we came here might happen again?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> We're only talking hypothetically, but that's exactly right! And, for that reason, we'll need to gather as much of that generated metal as we possibly can.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> So then, when we're on missions, there might be aradama with that metal inside them, so we need to watch out.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Yep! From the aradama we've defeated in the past few days, there seems to be lots of cases of finding noro containing that metal, though only in small amounts.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> We'll get up a whole bunch of it so you can go home, so just wait a little while longer.<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> Thank you.<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> But, let us do what we can too. We might not be able to defeat aradama, but I think we can help. It seems like we're the cause of this, after all.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> With your electric shocks, and depending on how we use Shirai-san's teleportation, it might be effective in fighting aradama?<br><strong>Kuroko:</strong> If that's what Onee-sama plans on doing, I, Kuroko, will offer you toji my assistance.<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> Shidou-san. Will you allow us to help you eliminate the aradama?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> I'd honestly like to refuse you here, but, alright. Only on the condition that you never put yourselves at risk. Fighting the aradama is our duty.<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> Understood, thank you very much! Alright-, let's go!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Let's give it our all, Misaka-san!<br><strong>Misaki:</strong> Do your best, everyone~.<br><div><iframe width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JHZISRWAzhM"></iframe></div>  </p><h2 id="railgun---kanami-start-the-mysterious-use-of-the-remote" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Railgun - Kanami: Start]: The Mysterious Use of the Remote</h2><p>One day, Kanami was having tea with Mikoto and the rest.</p><p><strong>Kanami:</strong> Are you used to living here yet?<br><strong>Kuroko:</strong> Yes, entirely. Though, the one thing I'm still not used to is sleeping apart from Onee-sama.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> You two sure are close, aren't you. Misaka-san and Shirai-san.<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> Just so you don't get the wrong idea, we only sleep in the same dorm room together... It's not like we sleep in the same bed.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> It's okay, we get it.<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> And also, I'm used to living here too. You do a lot for us. And just having to shoot aradama with electricity is easy for me.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I'm glad to hear it. What about you, Shokuhou-san? Is anything bothering you?<br><strong>Misaki:</strong> I'm doing just fine too. It's pretty fresh, this lifestyle over heree.<br>--[clatter]</p><p><strong>Kanami:</strong> Shokuhou-san, you dropped something just now. ...Is this a remote?<br><strong>Misaki:</strong> Thank youu, Etou-san.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Why are you carrying a remote around with you?<br><strong>Misaki:</strong> Hmm, why exactlyy? Why do you think that is, Etou-san?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> If you ask me, I think you can leave a remote in whichever room it belongs.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Maybe if you have to lend a remote to somebody, but I've never had to. What about you, Mai?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> There was one time Kanami-chan has said she couldn't find her remote, so I brought mine over to her room, but I think that's about it?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ahaha... My room was a real mess then.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah, I know! You didn't have a remote, and, when you were on your way home from buying one, you went to see Misaka-san's experiment!<br><strong>Misaki:</strong> If that were the case, would you just happen to be carrying one with you?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Thinking about it normally, I can't imagine why you'd carry one around, so does it have something to do with your power after all, Shokuhou-san?<br><strong>Misaki:</strong> Well, maybee.<br><strong>Misaki:</strong> I haven't felt like using my power in this world, but, by force of habit, I end up bringing it with mee.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I really wanna know what kind of power you're hiding-!<br><strong>Misaki:</strong> Then, how about you try guessing what it is? If you get it right, I'll let you knoww. But, each person only gets one guess.<br><strong>Misaki:</strong> And, Misaka-san, Shirai-san, giving them hints is off limits, understood?<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> I get it.<br><strong>Kuroko:</strong> This is another form of recreation. I wouldn't do something so rude.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> So you two really do know after all.<br><strong>Kuroko:</strong> Anyone in Academy City, whether or not they were aware of the full details, would have heard of just what power a level 5 like Shokuhou Misaki has.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I guess that makes sense, since she has a strong power. But still, what kind of power could it be?  </p><h2 id="railgun---kanami-end-it-could-be-that-kind-of-power" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Railgun - Kanami: End]: It Could Be That Kind of Power!</h2><p><strong>Yume:</strong> A power that uses a TV remote, huh-.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Remotes turn things on and off and can change the channels, but does that have anything to do with it?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Hmm~...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ah, I got it! It's a power to make machines do whatever you want!<br><strong>Misaki:</strong> Bzzt-. Tsubakuro-san, that's wrongg.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh-, but I was sure that was it-!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I was thinking something like that too, but I guess not. Then, is it a power that can send a sort of message to people far away? Like telepathy.<br><strong>Misaki:</strong> You were closee, but Yanase-san got it wrong too.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I thought it might send some sort of signal, but it's hard to narrow down, isn't it.<br><strong>Misaki:</strong> You're the only one left, Etou-san.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Give it your best shot, Kanami-chan.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> My answer is, simply-- A beam!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Huh?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Kanami-chan?<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> ...A beam? What made you think that??<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I was thinking, instead of a signal coming out the end of the remote to turn things off and on, it could shoot out a beam like, "Bibibibi-!"<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Kind of like, like this!<br><strong>Misaki:</strong> Fufufu, Etou-san. Now that you've learned the secret of my power, I won't be letting you off so easy~.<br><strong>Misaki:</strong> Take thiis, bibibibibibi-!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Wahh! Save me, Shirai-san!<br><strong>Kuroko:</strong> This way! Etou-san!<br><strong>Misaki:</strong> I can shoot a beam with lots of different effects, so you can't escape my beams~.<br><strong>Misaki:</strong> Take this, and that! Ahahahaha!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> And basically, Shokuhou-san's power is to control a beam that changes depending on the buttons she pushes!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Kanami-onee-san, that whole thing you acted out... What was that?<br><strong>Kuroko:</strong> And also, why did I appear in this fantasy of yours?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I mean, it just felt right for a battle between people with superpowers, so it popped in my head. Anyway, did I get it right?<br><strong>Misaki:</strong> Nope, my power isn't like that.<br><strong>Misaki:</strong> If I did have a beamm, I'd have helped you defeat the aradama a little.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I guess that's true.<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> You think? If you had a power like that, even if you tried to help out, you'd be so out of shape you'd just slow us down for sure.<br><strong>Misaki:</strong> Sighh... Why don't we ignore Misaka-san, who cant go through a tiny hypothetical without showing her powers of rudeness, and have some more tea?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> More tea sounds good, but let's have it with Misaka-san too!<br><strong>Misaki:</strong> If we mustt. As a prize just for trying, I'll allow Misaka-san to join us.<br><strong>Mikoto:</strong> Don't treat me like a consolation prize just because I was right.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Do these two maybe get along after all...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> That's what it seems like.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> But still, what's that remote for anyway?<br><div><iframe width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UMDuFWf-sOc"></iframe></div>  </p><h2 id="railgun---chie-start-sightseeing-kamakura-with-onee-san" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Railgun - Chie: Start]: Sightseeing Kamakura with Onee-san</h2><p><strong>Ruiko:</strong> I was thinking this seeing it up close, but, doesn't the Great Buddha of Kamakura seem kind of hunched over?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Now that you mention it, it is, isn't it.

Let's buy something to bring back as a present for them.<br><strong>Kazari:</strong> Sure!

I'd never taken a good look at the sights here myself, so it was fun.<br><strong>Ruiko:</strong> On top of that, you treated us to oden at that shop just now. Thanks a lot!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Fufu, it was nothing. Don't mention it.<br><strong>Ruiko:</strong> The croquettes we tried on the way were tasty too; I'm really glad you came with us, Setouchi-san!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Sanae-chan is the one who told me, if you're going into Kamakura, you have to stop by that croquette shop.<br><strong>Kazari:</strong> I see. So that was one of Iwakura-san's picks.<br><strong>Ruiko:</strong> We'll have to tell her thanks later then. Anyway, to finish off our sightseeing, let's pick out some souvenirs!<br><strong>Ruiko:</strong> What would be good-? It's gotta be something for everyone to eat, right? Since there's a lot of people, we should buy a variety of stuff.<br><strong>Ruiko:</strong> It would've been great if we had gotten some of that shiruko from before as a present.<br><strong>Kazari:</strong> I want to get some Kamakura Great Buddha candy and something else. Come to think of it, we've been eating different things all day, haven't we?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Isn't that fine?
