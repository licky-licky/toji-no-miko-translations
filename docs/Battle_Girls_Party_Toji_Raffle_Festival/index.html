<strong>Ellen:</strong> We have to go to the committee meeting for the Five Traditions Unified End of the Year Recognition Party!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Ugh, do I have to?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Don&#x27;t talk like that before you even try it, Kaoru! I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll be a lot of fun!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> I agree, Kaoru-san.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> On top of that, there are lots of middle school girls grouped with us, so as their onee-sans, it&#x27;s our duty to guide them.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> We can be Team Osafune Onee-sans!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Pass. Unlike you two, I&#x27;m not onee-san material.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Don&#x27;t be silly. You&#x27;d make a fine onee-san, Kaoru-san.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Even if I act all like &quot;I&#x27;m your onee-san, teehee&quot;... Look at me?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> I don&#x27;t have those fine persuasive qualities like you do to pull it off.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Persuasive qualities... Just where do you think you&#x27;re looking?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Hey, that reaction... You&#x27;re self-conscious about it?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Kaoru-san!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> ...Well if you don&#x27;t like it, then that&#x27;s that. We can be Team Osafune Mashiko instead!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> That&#x27;s even worse!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> And why&#x27;s that?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> The name makes it sound like I&#x27;m in charge. That&#x27;s way too much work.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Now then, let&#x27;s start the meeting. Our members are...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Mm, everyone&#x27;s here.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Our group is in charge of the entertainment for the recognition party.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Konohana-san, who&#x27;s leading the committee, said to come up with something that could &quot;satisfactorily conclude the year&quot;.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> I want to make a bigger attraction than the main event! We can&#x27;t lose to Hanahana!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> How&#x27;re we supposed to stand out more than the main event though?<br>
<strong>Hashi Keiko:</strong> (H-Huh? Why does it seem like everyone already knows each other?)<br>
<strong>Keiko:</strong> (I&#x27;m being left out... I can&#x27;t join the conversation... It&#x27;s too much for an outsider like me...)<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Wait wait, stooop!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Nn? What&#x27;s up, Mihono? If you have to go to the bathroom, hurry it up.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> That&#x27;s okay, I already went before the meeting!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> But what I mean is, shouldn&#x27;t we all introduce ourselves first? Hashi-san looks really lost.ã€€<br>
<strong>Keiko:</strong> (I might as well not be here... I have to get back to my monkey wrench and...)<br>
<strong>Keiko:</strong> Wh-Why is everyone looking at me!? D-Did you want me to come up with something!?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Fufu, you&#x27;re always watching out for others, Mihono-chan. Since we toji all know each other, we went straight into the meeting, didn&#x27;t we?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Nice thinking, Mihomiho! Let&#x27;s introduce ourselves! I&#x27;m Kohagura Ellen, from Osafune Girls&#x27; Academy!<br>
<strong>Keiko:</strong> Ah... Hello, nice to meet you. I&#x27;m Hashi Keiko, taking preparatory courses in engineering at Ayanokouji Martial Arts School...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> I&#x27;ll go next. I&#x27;m from Osafune Girls&#x27; Academy...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Now that we all know each other, we can start the meeting properly. If you want to make any suggestions, don&#x27;t hesitate to tell us, okay, Hashi-san?<br>
<strong>Keiko:</strong> Y-Yes, I will. I&#x27;ll try... But if I don&#x27;t have much to say, I&#x27;m sorry...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> You&#x27;re funny, Hajihaji!<br>
<strong>Keiko:</strong> Th-Thank you...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Setouchi-san, for the entertainment... Could we do something like the official tournament?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Oi oi, do you have any idea how many toji there are in the Five Traditions?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Enough to let us have plenty of matches with all kinds of toji!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> That certainly would feel like a conclusion to the year, but... Wouldn&#x27;t it be hard to organize? Maybe we should think of something more simple...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Hmm, that&#x27;s too bad then!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> It has to be fun and entertaining, while also concluding the year...<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> It&#x27;s difficult, isn&#x27;t it, Mihono-chan.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I feel like smoke&#x27;s gonna start coming out of my ears~! I wanna eat something sweet!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Ah, in that case, I have these sakura macarons. Want one?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Of course! Thanks, Mai!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Oh, I want one too! Mmm~, macarons are so good!<br>
<strong>Keiko:</strong> Um, Yanase-san, those macarons... Nevermind.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I have plenty to go around, so don&#x27;t worry. Here you go, Hashi-san.<br>
<strong>Keiko:</strong> Thank you very much. ...Ah, it&#x27;s good.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Right? Mai&#x27;s really good at cooking!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> She can make cookies and all kinds of stuff, and they&#x27;re all super tasty.<br>
<strong>Keiko:</strong> Not only are you a toji, but you&#x27;re also good at cooking... You&#x27;re amazing, Yanase-san...!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I-It&#x27;s not that amazing~.<br>
<strong>Keiko:</strong> ...This is so good that, maybe, we could make everyone compete for Yanase-san&#x27;s cooking...<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Now there&#x27;s an eccentric idea.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> But it sounds like fun too!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> We could set up a lot of prizes and a raffle, and start a battle royale!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> What if we gave every toji a raffle ticket, and they had to try and take each other&#x27;s while protecting their own...?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> We could call it a raffle competition!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> That&#x27;s taking it pretty literally.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> You don&#x27;t get it, Kaoru! That&#x27;s what&#x27;s great about it!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Does anyone have any objections...?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> It isn&#x27;t really an objection, but... How are students that aren&#x27;t toji meant to participate?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Ah, you&#x27;re right, we didn&#x27;t think of that...<br>
<strong>Keiko:</strong> Um, in that case... What if we gave the average number of raffle tickets the executive committee gets to all the non-toji students?<br>
<strong>Keiko:</strong> That way, you can join in supporting someone and have fun even if you&#x27;re not fighting... Would that work?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> I like the sound of that! Thank you, Hashi-san!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> We&#x27;ll go with that then. The entertainment at the recognition party will be a raffle competition!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="2-what-do-we-want"></a>2: What Do We Want?<a class="hash-link" href="#2-what-do-we-want" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Suzuka:</strong> A... Raffle competition?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Yes. We give raffle tickets to all the toji, and they compete over them for fun.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> While acting as a conclusion to the year, it also sounds entertaining... I like it.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Very well. This year, we will carry out a raffle competition.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Okay, thank you!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> With that settled, next we need to think of what prizes will be in the raffle. Have you come up with a list?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Ah, not yet, we&#x27;ll be deciding on the prizes in our next meeting.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Then this works out nicely. Please include dresses as prizes.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Now then, let&#x27;s think up what to put in the raffle!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> We have to include dresses?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Yes. Konohana-san said, since we&#x27;re having a big party, suggestions like that would be interesting.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Dresses, huh... Wouldn&#x27;t it be hard working up the courage to wear a dress while everyone&#x27;s in uniform, Kanami?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I know, Mihono-chan. I think it&#x27;d be hard to move around in too.<br>
<strong>Keiko:</strong> (The conversation is getting off-topic... But it&#x27;d be better not to interrupt them...)<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Can we put whatever we want in the raffle, Chie?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Mmhm, anything within common sense.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> ......Time off.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Eh? What was that, Kaoru-chan?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...I want time off.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> &quot;Time off&quot;, there.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> That&#x27;ll work!?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> It&#x27;ll be more fun if there&#x27;s all kinds of prizes in there. Feel free to come up with suggestions like Kaoru-san did, everyone.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> I&#x27;d like an all-you-can-eat dessert buffet!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Or what about a free pass for the cafeteria?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> It&#x27;s a big occasion, so let&#x27;s put in both! The more you can win, the better it gets!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> &quot;Dessert buffet&quot;, &quot;Cafeteria pass&quot;. Did you come up with anything, Etou-san, Yanase-san?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Would a swordfight ticket work? You can use it to have a match with anyone you want.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I thought you&#x27;d go with something like that, Kanami-chan.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> In my case... Why not an increase to club funding, or a chance to spend a day with the elite guard?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> &quot;Swordfight ticket&quot;, &quot;Club funding&quot;, &quot;Spend a day with the elite guard&quot;...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> What about you, Hajihaji?<br>
<strong>Keiko:</strong> Me!?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> You don&#x27;t have to think too hard about it. Just say whatever you want to do.<br>
<strong>Keiko:</strong> What I want to do... Then, servicing the Storm Armor, but with my skills...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Worrying about it won&#x27;t get you anywhere, Hajihaji. If you do screw something up, you can use that experience next time. It&#x27;s no problem.<br>
<strong>Keiko:</strong> N-No problem? B-But, if I screw up, then the consequences...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Then, let&#x27;s think about how to get you some help with that!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> What&#x27;s important is a helper for your preparatory classes, right? Then you need someone to support you... We need to recruit people in advance.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> And, when it comes to servicing... If nothing&#x27;s wrong, you&#x27;ll want to see a practical test of it. So we need to have toji ready too...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Ah, but, there&#x27;s a chance someone from the engineering courses won&#x27;t draw that prize. We have to make sure it works in case a toji draws it... Is there anything else we should consider?<br>
<strong>Keiko:</strong> N-No, if I have someone helping me, I think I should be fine.<br>
<strong>Keiko:</strong> But... I-Is this really okay?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> As a preparatory engineering student, this would be a great experience for you, wouldn&#x27;t it?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m glad to have your point of view. Thank you, Hashi-san.<br>
<strong>Keiko:</strong> Y-You don&#x27;t need to thank me for anything...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> See, most of us here are toji, aren&#x27;t we?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> So, even if we try, it&#x27;s hard to represent students from other departments. But we should think of prizes that everyone from the Five Traditions can have fun with!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I see you took into account students from all departments. These prizes should do fine.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I&#x27;ll make an announcement summarizing the raffle competition to the Five Traditions.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> We don&#x27;t have to do anything to help with that, right?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Not at all. You&#x27;re doing more than enough by preparing the party&#x27;s entertainment.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...I&#x27;m curious, why did you come this time in place of Setouchi-san?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...I&#x27;m just that serious about this project. I want to make sure it&#x27;s a success, no matter what.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> How reliable of you. You&#x27;ve been a great help, Mashiko-san.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="3-hashi-vanished"></a>3: Hashi Vanished<a class="hash-link" href="#3-hashi-vanished" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Toji A:</strong> Hey, did you see what they&#x27;re doing for the recognition party&#x27;s entertainment?<br>
<strong>Toji B:</strong> I did! A raffle competition, right? I want that all-you-can-eat dessert buffet!<br>
<strong>Toji A:</strong> I&#x27;m more interested in spending a day with the elite guard. You could get to work with Shidou-san!<br>
<strong>Toji B:</strong> Better collect all the raffle tickets you can! Things are gonna get serious when it starts, you know?<br>
<strong>Toji A:</strong> Same goes for you!<br>
<strong>Keiko:</strong> Uuu... People are already talking about the raffle competition.<br>
<strong>Keiko:</strong> I&#x27;m happy about getting to service Storm Armor, but... Can someone like me really handle that...<br>
<strong>Keiko:</strong> The nervousness is making my stomach hurt... Maintenance... It doesn&#x27;t matter what, I have to do maintenance on something...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Let&#x27;s start today&#x27;s work on preparing for the raffle competition!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Oh, hold up, Mihono-chan. I don&#x27;t think Hashi-san&#x27;s here yet.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Hashi-san&#x27;s never been late before... Setouchi-san, did she tell you anything?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> I haven&#x27;t heard from her. Maybe we should send someone to look for her?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Sure thing! I&#x27;m on it!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Thank you, Ellen-san. I think it would help if we sent at least one more person though...<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Pass. I&#x27;ll be here to fill in Ellen&#x27;s share while she&#x27;s gone.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> What&#x27;re you working so hard for, Kaoru?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> I&#x27;m trying to rack up enough good karma to win that time off.<br>
<strong>Nene:</strong> Ne-!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> That explains it. In that case, I&#x27;ll go with Ellen-chan.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Hi! Let&#x27;s go, Kanamin!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Hajihaji&#x27;s not here, Kanamin. Where could she have gone?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I know she was here after school ended.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Somebody said she was walking around looking all dizzy.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Walking around all dizzy... That sounds like trouble! Hajihaji must be in the infirmary or the dorms!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> I&#x27;ll check the infirmary! You go see her dorm room, Kanamin!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Okay!<br>
<strong>Keiko:</strong> Ughh....<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Hashi-san, are you in there? Huh, the door&#x27;s unlocked... I&#x27;m coming in.<br>
<strong>Keiko:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Oh, there you are... Hey, are you okay!? You&#x27;re as pale as a ghost!?<br>
<strong>Keiko:</strong> Why is Etou-san here...?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I came because we were worried about you!<br>
<strong>Keiko:</strong> I made Etou-san and the others worry about me... My life is over...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> It&#x27;s still going on though!?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Hold on, I have to message Ellen-chan real quick!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> ...So basically, you wanted to do maintenance on Storm Armor so badly that it made you nervous, so you hardly slept in order to study servicing it?<br>
<strong>Keiko:</strong> ...Yes. I can&#x27;t fall asleep unless I&#x27;ve done some maintenance...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Have you been up all this time? You&#x27;re working yourself too hard, Hajihaji.<br>
<strong>Keiko:</strong> But I&#x27;m nervous... I have to distract myself with some maintenance...<br>
<strong>Keiko:</strong> Pliers are the best... Screws are cute... My heaven is here...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Oh! Hajihaji has a metal fetish.<br>
<strong>Keiko:</strong> That&#x27;s not it...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Anyway, you have to relax, Hashi-san. Maybe Setouchi-san will have some advice to help you?<br>
<strong>Keiko:</strong> Even though I&#x27;m causing you so much trouble... Thank you so much. You must be goddess, Etou-san...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I&#x27;m not though!?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> And that&#x27;s how Kanamin became goddess!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Haha-! Goddess Kanami-sama!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I said I&#x27;m not!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Etou-san. What did Hashi-san have to say?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Oh, yeah. If it&#x27;s possible, she wants to focus on some kind of behind the scenes work that lets her use tools.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Okay, then let&#x27;s let her do that. And also, we&#x27;ll try to give her free time to practice maintenance in, okay?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> That&#x27;s a good idea, Chii-nee! I&#x27;ll go tell Hashi-san!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah, wait up, Mihono-chan! I&#x27;ll go too!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> And they&#x27;re gone. Did you want to go too, Mai?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I do, but... It&#x27;s best not to surround her with too many people when she&#x27;s not feeling well.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Okay. Then, we&#x27;ll have to work extra hard to make up for them while they&#x27;re gone.<br>
<strong>Nene:</strong> Ne-!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="4-kaorus-plan"></a>4: Kaoru&#x27;s Plan<a class="hash-link" href="#4-kaorus-plan" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> Huh!?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> What happened, Mihono? Did you forget something?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I didn&#x27;t, but... Uhh, right now, I was going over the orders for the amount of prizes, and...<br>
<strong>Nene:</strong> Nene-?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> The order for the dresses... There&#x27;s enough dresses for all of the students.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Huh!? Oi! Who&#x27;s the one that ordered the dresses!?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> No, call up the supplier before anything...<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Oh, that&#x27;s not a mistake. Konohana-san placed the order for the dresses, so it&#x27;s alright.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...The elite guard are something else.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Apparently, that&#x27;s what happened, Chie. It&#x27;s weird to see Kaoru acting like such a leader.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Did Team Onee-sans get to her after all?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> I don&#x27;t really know. It&#x27;s not like she&#x27;s guaranteed to get the time off if she works harder...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> But, I do think it&#x27;s good she&#x27;s getting so involved!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> I agree. We have to follow the example she&#x27;s setting!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Of course! Whether it&#x27;s the preparation or the main event, let&#x27;s make it as fun as we can!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...Nene. I&#x27;m trying hard at getting things set up, right?<br>
<strong>Nene:</strong> Nene-!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> And everyone can tell, right?<br>
<strong>Nene:</strong> Ne-!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Then... Everything should be ready. If the time off won&#x27;t come to me... I&#x27;ve gotta go to it.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Hey, Mihono... You got a minute?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> What&#x27;s up, Kaoru-san?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> I wanted to ask you something... If, during the raffle competition, you get the time off... Could you give it to me?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Of course, if there&#x27;s something else you wanted, I&#x27;ll give it to you if I get it. All I want is that time off.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> So... Please!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> You&#x27;ve been working so hard getting things ready, Kaoru-san... So sure!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> If I get the time off, I&#x27;ll give it to you!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> (...Just as planned!)<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> And Chie and Mai agreed. Too easy. Ah! Heyyy, Ellen!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Kaoru-! What is it?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> If you get the time off from the raffle competition, give it to me.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> ...Oh, so that&#x27;s what you&#x27;ve been up to. This is why you were helping so much with the preparations, right?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> You planned to show everyone how hard you were working, making it easier to convince them to give you their time off!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Sure did. Got a problem with it? I&#x27;m not taking any chances with that time off.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> It&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s guaranteed, but... With seven people, one of them is bound to get it.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Somehow, I&#x27;m relieved to see you acting more like yourself! How about this... If you get the all-you-can-eat dessert buffet, then it&#x27;s win-win for both of us, right?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> No problem. Is that negotiations settled?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> I think so. So then, who are you going to ask next?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Kanami... Wait, are you coming too?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Yes! It sounds like fun, so I&#x27;ll join you!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Time off? Sure!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Thanks, Kanami.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> In exchange, I&#x27;d be happy if you had a sparring session with me!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Well, that&#x27;s about what I expected. I don&#x27;t really want to, but... If that&#x27;s what it takes.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Then, let&#x27;s go right now!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...Huh? Are you serious!?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> We have plenty spare time, so we can fight all we want, Kaoru-chan!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> ...Kanamin loves a good fight after all! Ooh, I thought up something good... Now I&#x27;m looking forward to the main event!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="5-the-raffle-competition-begins"></a>5: The Raffle Competition Begins!<a class="hash-link" href="#5-the-raffle-competition-begins" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>On the day of the End of the School Year Recognition Party--</p><p><strong>Suzuka:</strong> With that, we will now begin the raffle competition.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> To start, as members of the executive committee, Setouchi-san, Hashi-san, and I will be overseeing the competition.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Sorry, Hashi-san, for making you do so much committee work.<br>
<strong>Keiko:</strong> N-No, it&#x27;s fine... I&#x27;ll do what I can!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Alright! Me and Kanami will... Wait, where&#x27;s Kanami!?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Kanamin went running off as soon as it started.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Uwaaah! Where&#x27;d you go, Kanami-!?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Guess I should get going too. Let&#x27;s show &#x27;em what we&#x27;ve got, Nene.<br>
<strong>Nene:</strong> Ne-!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Whoa there, hold on a moment, Kaoru!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Nn? What do you want?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> A hachimanriki surprise attack!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> -! Kongoushin!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Oh! Nicely blocked, Kaoru!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Don&#x27;t give me that. The hell are you doing, attacking me out of nowhere?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Isn&#x27;t it obvious... Kaoru, let&#x27;s fight!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Ugh... No way!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Why should I fight you! We don&#x27;t get anything out of fighting other committee members!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Kanamin&#x27;s request for you gave me an idea...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> A fight between best friends, with the raffle tickets on the line... Doesn&#x27;t it get you fired up!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> That&#x27;s your reason!?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> That&#x27;s all the reason I need!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> And of course, if you don&#x27;t fight me, forget about me giving you that time off!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> That&#x27;s playing dirty!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> That&#x27;s a compliment to me!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> We&#x27;ve got committee work to do too, so I wanted to get as much as I could now... You better not regret this later!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> That&#x27;s it! That&#x27;s what I was looking for! Now you&#x27;re getting into it!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Tch! RRRYAAA!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Whoops, you&#x27;re not going to hit me like that!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> That&#x27;s what... You think!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Wow!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Now... We&#x27;re done here!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> ...!<br>
<strong>Toji A:</strong> You&#x27;re wide open! HAAAAAAH!!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> A sneak attack!?<br>
<strong>Toji B:</strong> You better be ready, Kohagura Ellen!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> There&#x27;s one after me too! Kaoru, let&#x27;s have a ceasefire while we beat them!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Yeah, after we deal with you two, we can finish what we started!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Just kidding.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Huh!? Kaoru-? Where&#x27;d you go, Kaoru... Wah!?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> I saw my chance and took it. Those two should be able to keep Ellen busy for a while.<br>
<strong>Nene:</strong> Ne-?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Don&#x27;t worry about her. I&#x27;ve seriously gotta make up for lost time now.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Let&#x27;s get straight to collecting tickets.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Kaoru-san! You came at a good time!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...I don&#x27;t like the look of this, Nene.<br>
<strong>Nene:</strong> Ne.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> A few people were injured over here! Come help us move them to the infirmary, Kaoru-chan!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> I knew it-! Just let me get raffle tickets-!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="6-who-will-lady-luck-favor"></a>6: Who Will Lady Luck Favor?<a class="hash-link" href="#6-who-will-lady-luck-favor" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Kaoru:</strong> I didn&#x27;t get any tickets at all... They&#x27;re working the committee to death...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Don&#x27;t worry about it, Kaoru! Even if you don&#x27;t have a whole lot, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll still pull something good!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Hey, don&#x27;t act like this isn&#x27;t your fault. Who&#x27;s the one who held me up right at the start?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> But wasn&#x27;t it a lot of fun, fighting each other seriously?<br>
<strong>Keiko:</strong> U-Um... Was it alright for me to receive a dress too?<br>
<strong>Keiko:</strong> I didn&#x27;t draw a dress from the raffle...<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Kanami said it was fine, so there&#x27;s nothing to worry about.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> But still, you had some crazy luck with your draws.<br>
<strong>Keiko:</strong> I can use the cafeteria ticket, though I don&#x27;t know what to do with the club funding and day with the elite guard.<br>
<strong>Keiko:</strong> And... I&#x27;m sure I used up all my life&#x27;s luck here...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> You still have plenty more luck ahead of you, Hajihaji!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Speaking of which, is Kanamin still not done with the raffle?<br>
<strong>Keiko:</strong> Ah, yes, she was halfway finished with all her draws when I last saw her.<br>
<strong>Keiko:</strong> I want to thank Etou-san for the dress, but... I don&#x27;t think I can do it just yet.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> And, from the half she got, most of them were dresses. It&#x27;s pretty crazy how many of them are in there.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Kanami could totally open a dress store after this!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> What did you get from the raffle, Mihono-chan?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Listen to this, Mai~. Things were going good at first, but the second half of my draws were a total bust~.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> And whenever I won something from the raffle, it was all dresses too... How&#x27;d you do, Mai?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Actually... I won the all-you-can-eat desserts!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> I&#x27;m so jealous, Maimai!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...So Mai didn&#x27;t get the time off either.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I&#x27;m back.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Hey, Kanami! Here, I got a drink for you!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Thanks, Mihono-chan. ...Phew, that hits the spot.<br>
<strong>Keiko:</strong> U-Um, Etou-san, this dress, thank you for giving it to me...!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Don&#x27;t mention it. I got the swordfight ticket, so I&#x27;m feeling generous!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ooh! Congrats, Kanami!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...I was betting on Kanami to get the time off, but that didn&#x27;t work out either...<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Guess I really have to do it myself.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> So you&#x27;re finally taking your shot, Kaoru...!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Yeah... I only have this one ticket, but... I&#x27;ll bet everything on it!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Oh, Kaoru-san. Are you here to try your luck?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Hope it hasn&#x27;t been too hard working the raffle. Did anybody get the time off yet?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Don&#x27;t worry, it&#x27;s still in there. Go on, give it a draw, Kaoru-san.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Ahh... It must be my fate to pull it now.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...Hah!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Congratulations, Kaoru-san! You won the opportunity to monitor the Storm Armor test!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Monitoring... Am I gonna have to do this on top of my normal missions...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> How&#x27;d it go, Kaoru?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> For now... I&#x27;m just going to eat.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Uh oh, it can&#x27;t be good news then. Kaoru, maybe changing into your dress will make you feel better~.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> I didn&#x27;t get a dress.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> That&#x27;s alright! I thought you might not, so I asked Kanamin for one!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Sigh, I can&#x27;t do this. If I don&#x27;t eat, I can&#x27;t do this.<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> Are you having a good time?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Geh, it&#x27;s the ha... the president.<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> What was that you almost called me just now?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Y-You&#x27;re just hearing things?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> A-Anyway, it&#x27;s alright. The food&#x27;s pretty good at this party.<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> Good, eat up then. Tomorrow, you&#x27;ve got work to do in Kyushu.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Huh?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> There you go again, Kaoru! You&#x27;re so loved by your job!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Is that supposed to make me feel better-!? Bring me another plate-!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah, I can go get that.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Great, thanks.<br>
<strong>Keiko:</strong> ...Um, did your raffle not go well?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Yeah, I got Storm Armor monitoring duty.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> I work my ass off getting the raffle competition ready, and all I get is work in Kyushu and with Storm Armor! If I don&#x27;t eat my fill here, I can&#x27;t go on like this!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Nice thinking, Kaoru!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> You have to makes sure the Storm Armor Hajihaji does maintenance on gets a good testing!<br>
<strong>Keiko:</strong> R-Right! I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s going to be someone I know helping me!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> There&#x27;s nothing nice about this.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> If everybody did the raffle and nobody got the time off, then we should&#x27;ve worked on the rates some more!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> But this just means there&#x27;s jobs that need your help! Right, Mai?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> That&#x27;s true; you must have a higher calling, Kaoru-san.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> And I&#x27;m not happy about it! Somebody, just give me some time offff!</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations/edit/docs/Battle_Girls_Party_Toji_Raffle_Festival.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_2_ui" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_3DPF"></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"></div></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_35-E thin-scrollbar"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#1-lets-think-up-entertainment" class="table-of-contents__link">1: Let&#39;s Think Up Entertainment</a></li><li><a href="#2-what-do-we-want" class="table-of-contents__link">2: What Do We Want?</a></li><li><a href="#3-hashi-vanished" class="table-of-contents__link">3: Hashi Vanished</a></li><li><a href="#4-kaorus-plan" class="table-of-contents__link">4: Kaoru&#39;s Plan</a></li><li><a href="#5-the-raffle-competition-begins" class="table-of-contents__link">5: The Raffle Competition Begins!</a></li><li><a href="#6-who-will-lady-luck-favor" class="table-of-contents__link">6: Who Will Lady Luck Favor?</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Links</div><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://pastebin.com/LdyviZ8Z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Translator anon&#x27;s pastebin<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Site source code<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Built with Docusaurus.</div></div></div></footer></div>
