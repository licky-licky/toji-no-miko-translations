## 1: The Day We Were Reunited Came Suddenly    
**Yui:** Wow; just like you'd expect from a holiday, there's good looking girls everywhere! Time to get right on watching hotties shopping!  
**Yui:** ...Or, I'd like to, but.  
**Aradama:** GUOOOOOOOO...  
**Yui:** Of course they'd show up. Well, I did come here today because of a mission, so what can you do.  
**Yui:** To start off, I'll just put everything into clearing them out! TAAAAAAAAHH!!  
**Aradama:** GUOOOOOO...  
**Yui:** Gegh, when'd I get surrounded! Geez, unless it's a bunch of cute girls who're ganging up on me, no thank you-.  
**???:** Moron, you don't got room to be spouting off dumb stuff like that!  
**Yui:** ...Ah-- That voice!!  
**Akira:** Long time no see, Yui.  
**Yui:** Boss! To think we'd meet again; I'm ultra happy! We must really be tied by the red string of fate...  
**Akira:** I told you to quit talking stupid. C'mon, let's go!  
**Yui:** Okay! If it's with you, I'll follow through fire or aradama! YAAAAAHHH!!  
**Akira:** You're not doing too bad for yourself, Yui. I can't let you show me up.  
**Akira:** ORAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!  
**Yui:** Boss, you're so cool! You're getting me even more excited!  
**Yui:** UOORYAAAAAAAAAHHH!!!  
**Aradama:** GUOOOOOOOO...  
**Yui:** Phew, looks like we got rid of them all for now. Thanks a lot for coming to my rescue, Boss.  
**Akira:** You don't gotta thank me. And anyway, you look like you've been improving since last time.  
**Yui:** Ahahah, hearing you compliment me makes me so happy! Working with the MPD was really tough, so it trained me up!  
**Akira:** Huh, so you're one of the ones who transferred too.  
**Akira:** That's pretty good of you, goin' out of your way taking dangerous work like that.  
**Yui:** You think so? But, you'd get paid more for transferring, right?  
**Akira:** The pay!?  
**Yui:** Yep. I figured, even if it was a little riskier, since I'd be working the same hours, I'd offer to do the one gave more money.  
**Akira:** I-Is that why...  
**Akira:** (...Everybody's got their own reasons. Whatever Yui's fighting for, it's not my place to judge.)  
**Yui:** I know! Since more of them might pop out, want to spend some time together for a while?  
**Akira:** Well, it wouldn't be bad having you along.  
**Yui:** Great-! Our memorable first date! Until the aradama arrive, let's enjoy it to the fullest.  
**Akira:** D-Date!? Nobody said anything like that!  
**Yui:** No matter how you look at it, taking a beautiful girl around town is a date!  

## 2: Akira and Yui's Harajuku Date?
**Akira:** Harajuku's such a busy place; it's like there's a festival going on, huh.  
**Yui:** That's for sure. Every time I come here, there's cuties all around. Just being in that gives me chills!  
**Yui:** Ah, check it out, Boss! Look at all the pretty girls lined up outside that shop!  
**Akira:** That's all you've been talking about for a while.  
**Yui:** [sniff sniff], smells nice and sweet. Ahh, it's line for a crepe shop. Want to get in line too?  
**Akira:** Crepes, huh...  
**Yui:** Boss, do you like crepes or something!?  
**Akira:** N-Not really, but if you want one that bad, I'll wait in line with you.  
**Yui:** Great-!  
**Yui:** We're finally up to order, Boss! What should we get?  
**Akira:** Dunno... Might as well go with what's popular.  
**Yui:** That'd be a triple berry crepe with strawberry toppings, plus extra helpings of whipped creme on top! It's the most popular item that looks great in the hands of a cute girl!  
**Yui:** Do you like cute things, Boss?  
**Akira:** I-I'm not into that stuff or anything!  
**Yui:** Ehh, but isn't gap moe the best? It makes your heart skip a beat!  
**Akira:** You're a real noisy one, y'know that... C'mon Yui, quit poking fun at me and order something.  
**Yui:** Ahaha, guess I should. Then, I'll have whatever's cheapest!  
**Akira:** Whatever's cheapest is just dough covered in sugar! That's all you want after all that waiting in line?  
**Yui:** That's fine. See, look, it's only half the price of your crepe!  
**Akira:** (Yui's working tough missions to make money, but then she cheaps out here. I really don't get her...)  
**Yui:** Check this out, Boss! This shop has all these cute knickknacks-!  
**Akira:** Ohh! You're not kidding. What's with this little bunny; it's cute as hell!  
**Akira:** This one's a pouch, and they've got a matching handkerchief! Might as well get the full set...  
**Yui:** So you really do like cute things, don't you, Boss.  
**Akira:** I-I told you I don't! I was just thinking, this'd be good for a buddy of mine!  
**Akira:** And anyway, you haven't been buying anything at any of these stores, have you Yui?  
**Yui:** I'm fine with that. I get satisfied just seeing cute girls happy with cute things up close.  
**Akira:** You're a real weird one, ain'tcha.  
**Yui:** Am I? But, on top of being really fun to watch, it's always free to look!  
**Akira:** I mean, if that's enough for you, I guess it's alright...  
**Akira:** (I thought she was fighting for money to have fun with, but she's penny pinching the whole way... Has she got some other reason?)  
**Akira:** Hey, Yui. There's something I kinda wanted to ask you...  
**Aradama:** GUOOOOOOOO...  
**Akira:** Shit, why'd they have to come out now! We're having a conversation here!  
**Yui:** Come on, Boss, let's just clear them out for now! I'll have all the time you need to hear out your love confession later.  
**Akira:** It's nothing like that-! Forget it; let's go keep the people round here safe!  

## 3: Why You'd Take Such Tough Assignments
**Aradama:** GUOOO...  
**Yui:** This'll finish them! DORYAAAAHHH!!!  
**Aradama:** GUOOOOoo...  
**Akira:** Taking out all those aradama in one go... Way to go, Yui!  
**Yui:** Ahahah. I get holiday pay for working today, so I'm more into it than usual.  
**Akira:** Holiday pay, huh...  
**Yui:** Boss? What's wrong? Your face's all scrunched up.  
**Yui:** We finished our mission safe and sound, so let's get right back to our Harajuku date! Can we go look in that novelty shop?  
**Akira:** Yeah, I'm fine with it...  
**Yui:** Uwahh, this doll's mega cute! Mister, I want this one!  
**Akira:** Just buying it on the spot...? Wait, are you sure about that? It's pretty expensive.  
**Yui:** But look how cute it is? The moment you think, "This is the one!" you've gotta pay up.  
**Akira:** I mean, sure, it is cute... So this is the stuff you're into, Yui?  
**Yui:** Ehh, it's not for me. It's a present for my little sister. Her hospital room's pretty empty, so I wanted to give it some cute decorations.  
**Akira:** Hospital room? Your sister?  
**Yui:** Ah, I never told you, did I. My little sister's been sick in the hospital for a long time.  
**Yui:** Her operations and everything cost a lot of money, so I have to work really hard.  
**Akira:** Yui... Then, that means, when you transferred for work, that was...  
**Yui:** Yeah. There might have been a lot of tough moments, but, compared to the hard treatments my sister's putting up with while battling disease, it's nothing at all!  
**Akira:** ......  
**Yui:** Boss? What's the matter? You look choked up.  
**Akira:** Sorry. I went and got you all wrong, Yui.  
**Yui:** B-Boss! What happened to you!?  
**Yui:** Wow, you look gorgeous even when you're crying! Can I take a picture!?  
**Akira:** N-No shit you can't! And anyway, I wasn't crying!  
**Yui:** Ehh, you were though? A single pretty tear was sliding down your cool face.  
**Akira:** Like hell it was. But... If it's cool, give this to your sister too.  
**Yui:** Eh? Isn't this the bunny rabbit pouch you bought before... Are you sure? Weren't you giving it to your friend...  
**Akira:** Just take it already! And take the handkerchief that goes with it.  
**Yui:** Boss... You might not look like it, but you've got cute tastes! And you're so kind and a natural crier on top; you're too amazing!   
**Akira:** D-Dumbass! None of that's true!  
**Yui:** Your embarrassed face's the best too! I'm falling more and more in love with you!  
**Akira:** ......  
**Yui:** I got it; if we're doing this, why don't we buy something matching for you, me, and my sister?  
**Akira:** Sure thing; what do you want? I'll buy you whatever.  
**Yui:** You're buying!? That's my Boss; so generous!  
**Akira:** Yeah, just to make up for something stupid I got in my head! Pick whatever you want!  
**Yui:** You're the best, Boss! I'll spend the rest of my life with you!
