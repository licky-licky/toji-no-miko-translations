Not much time left in our New Year&#x27;s break, huh. I didn&#x27;t get to mess around anywhere near as much as I wanted... Hey, Kagari, wanna go have some fun somewhere?<br>
<strong>Kagari:</strong> Why would I go with you, Minato-senpai... Besides, I have my work to do for the Origami family, so no thank you.<br>
<strong>Minato:</strong> Ehh-, then what about if I invite Yukari too? That way you&#x27;d have to come along with us. When should we go? Hey-, when do you have some free time?<br>
<strong>Kagari:</strong> (Sigh, she always forces things to go her way... Honestly, why does she feel the need to involve herself in others&#x27; business like this?)<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Minato, I hate to tell you this, but we won&#x27;t have any time to enjoy ourselves. Starting tomorrow, at Yuzuki-senpai&#x27;s proposal, we of Renpu Senior High School&#x27;s Unit One will be undergoing a training camp.<br>
<strong>Kagari:</strong> A training camp!?<br>
The next day.</p><p><strong>Fushimi Yuzuki:</strong> Seems like we&#x27;re all here.<br>
<strong>Minato:</strong> Huh? But Ema and Iroha-senpai aren&#x27;t here yet?<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> The two of them are busy with a mission and won&#x27;t be attending. I thought I told you that yesterday.<br>
<strong>Minato:</strong> Ahaha, you did? I might&#x27;ve been too distracted figuring out what snacks to bring to listen.<br>
<strong>Kagari:</strong> (Sigh... She isn&#x27;t showing an ounce of stress. Well, it&#x27;s not as if Minato-senpai&#x27;s the only one like that...)<br>
<strong>Sagami Yukina:</strong> Sana, will you look at this! Aren&#x27;t these pajamas so cute? I bought them just for today, after I heard I would be staying the night with Yukari-onee-sama~.<br>
<strong>Arami Sana:</strong> Whoa-, that&#x27;s super frilly... I bet it&#x27;d look great on you, Yukina-senpai.<br>
<strong>Yukina:</strong> Wouldn&#x27;t it~? Fufu, tonight I&#x27;ll be sleeping in this, holding hands with Yukari-onee-sama~. I can&#x27;t wait~!<br>
<strong>Yukina:</strong> Hiiragi-san, just so you know, the futon next to Yukari-onee-sama belongs to me! I&#x27;m not letting you have it no matter what.<br>
<strong>Kagari:</strong> Sigh... Sorry to spoil your fun, but Yukari-sama has said she will be sleeping in her own private room.<br>
<strong>Yukina:</strong> What did you say!? Don&#x27;t tell me, you&#x27;re the one who put Yukari-onee-sama up to this...<br>
<strong>Kagari:</strong> Yukari-sama decided upon it herself. And, I&#x27;ll tell you just so you know, we aren&#x27;t holding this training camp so you can amuse yourself.<br>
<strong>Yukina:</strong> I don&#x27;t need you to tell me that. Anyway, don&#x27;t you think there are others you should be lecturing instead of me?<br>
<strong>Kagari:</strong> Others I should be lecturing...?<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> Wow-, Minato-senpai. Look at all the snacks you&#x27;re bringing! You think you could share some of that with me-?<br>
<strong>Minato:</strong> Hmm, then, how about we make a trade? You let me borrow that game you&#x27;re bringing and it&#x27;s a deal.<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> Eh-!? But I just bought this game! I was only bringing it &#x27;cause I thought I&#x27;d be able to 100% it during the camp-!<br>
<strong>Kagari:</strong> (Sigh... None of them are taking this seriously at all.)<br>
<strong>Kagari:</strong> (This training camp is an important step in preparing our unit to be strong enough should a great disaster happen... Do they not understand our purpose here?)<br>
<strong>Kagari:</strong> (No, they must understand it. It&#x27;s just that, when the time comes, the weight of their duties isn&#x27;t as heavy as the one I must do. That&#x27;s why they can be so carefree...)<br>
<strong>Minato:</strong> Yukari, Yuzuki-senpai, here we go-! TAAAAAAA-!<br>
<strong>Kagari:</strong> (I wasn&#x27;t sure how things would turn out at first, but I should have expected this from Minato-senpai. The moment we began to practice, she became so serious it was like looking at a different person.)<br>
<strong>Kagari:</strong> (Yukari-sama and Yuzuki-senpai too, with the way they can predict each other&#x27;s movements, the upperclassman team is impressively coordinated. On the other hand...)<br>
<strong>Yukina:</strong> Hey, Hiiragi-san! Sana! Why are you getting out ahead of me!?<br>
<strong>Kagari:</strong> You&#x27;re the one who&#x27;s moving too slowly. If this were actual combat, that opening would absolutely come under attack.<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> Yeah, when it comes down to it, I&#x27;m not gonna hold back anything either.<br>
<strong>Yukina:</strong> Hmph, trying to fight while working with you two is so stupid I&#x27;d rather not even try anymore.<br>
<strong>Minato:</strong> Ahaha-! It&#x27;s like this every time; the three on the underclassman team are so out of sync it&#x27;s hilarious.<br>
<strong>Yuzuki:</strong> Yes, I&#x27;ve spotted the greatest issue for us to work through here.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Right. During this camp, our greatest priority should be improving the teamwork of those three.<br>
<strong>Yuzuki:</strong> I can think of a number of methods, but what do you think we should do for them to improve, Yukari?<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> If you ask me, it would be best if we found a way to bring them closer using this camp environment during the brief time we have here...<br>
<strong>Minato:</strong> In that case, what if we put the underclassman team in charge of tonight&#x27;s dinner? If they finish a common goal together, won&#x27;t it deepen their friendship! You three feel the same, right?<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> Dinner duty!? Minato-senpai, isn&#x27;t it more like you just thought it&#x27;d be a pain in the butt doing it yourself?<br>
<strong>Kagari:</strong> The three of us, in charge of dinner? There&#x27;s a limit to how inefficient you can make this. Since we went to the lengths of coming here, I believe we should spend our time doing more proper training exercises.<br>
<strong>Yukina:</strong> I don&#x27;t want to be with these two either. I thought I would finally get to spend 24 hours together with Yukari-onee-sama...<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Yukina, Sana, Kagari, this is an order from your captain. In order to improve your teamwork, you are to carry out this training at once.<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> If it&#x27;s the captain&#x27;s orders, I guess we don&#x27;t have a choice but to go with it...<br>
<strong>Kagari:</strong> Yes, once an order is given, we&#x27;ll carry it out straight away. First, we&#x27;ll need to do the shopping. Come on, Sagami-san, let&#x27;s go.<br>
<strong>Yukina:</strong> Could you not order me around? I&#x27;m only going because Yukari-onee-sama told me to.<br>
<strong>Minato:</strong> Can those three actually manage to get along for long enough to go shopping...?<br>
<strong>Yuzuki:</strong> Being able to overcome that is another part of their training.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> That&#x27;s right. Now that we&#x27;ve ordered them out, all we can do is wait and believe in them.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="2-dinner-cooking-fraught-with-trouble"></a>2: Dinner Cooking Fraught with Trouble<a class="hash-link" href="#2-dinner-cooking-fraught-with-trouble" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Kagari:</strong> Before we begin buying anything, I think we should first decide on a dinner menu, but what are you two best at cooking...<br>
<strong>Kagari:</strong> Oh? Sana and Sagami-san must have left at some point. Where could they have gone...<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> Kagari-senpai, I went ahead and put what I want to eat in the shopping basket!<br>
<strong>Kagari:</strong> Hang on, Sana, you can&#x27;t only buy this many snacks. You won&#x27;t be able to eat them all, will you?<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> It&#x27;s all good. Sweets go in a different stomach, right? Besides, if we have to, Minato-senpai and me&#x27;ll take responsibility and eat all of it!<br>
<strong>Kagari:</strong> Really now... Do you know where Sagami-san went, by the way? I haven&#x27;t seen her since we came in.<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> If you&#x27;re looking for Yukina-senpai, she&#x27;s over at the counter there.<br>
<strong>Yukina:</strong> Fufufu~. Fish broiled in soy sauce, chopped burdock, spinach in tofu salad with white miso dressing; since Yukari-onee-sama loves Japanese style dishes, she&#x27;ll be so happy.<br>
<strong>Kagari:</strong> Wait, Sagami-san, aren&#x27;t these all pre-packaged side dishes? The mission we were given was to work together, from buying the ingredients to cooking dinner. Just buying them pre-packaged is missing the point.<br>
<strong>Yukina:</strong> Well, if I tried to work with you two, we&#x27;d never finish even if we had all the time in the world.<br>
<strong>Kagari:</strong> But it&#x27;s our objective here to do something about that. Let&#x27;s first think up a menu together... Sana, please stop buying any more snacks.<br>
<strong>Kagari:</strong> (Sigh... As disorganized as we are, can we even reach a finished dinner without incident? I&#x27;m concerned with what&#x27;s coming next...)<br>
<strong>Kagari:</strong> In the end, we never decided on a menu, and only bought ingredients for what each of us wanted to cook. Will this really be alright...<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> Huh? Yukina-senpai, you&#x27;re so good with a knife! It&#x27;s sorta surprising...<br>
<strong>Yukina:</strong> A toji uses their okatana every day, so it&#x27;s only natural.<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> Oh yeah. Then, let me try cutting some stuff too.<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> Wah-, that&#x27;s crazy! Vegetables and fish both feel totally different when you cut them. Cooking&#x27;s actually pretty fun when you give it a shot, huh, Kagari-senpai.<br>
<strong>Kagari:</strong> Yes, I know... Wait, hold on, Sana, that fish you&#x27;re cutting, that&#x27;s the one I bought for the nimono I was making.<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> Eh-!? You should tell me that sooner-. I already chopped it down to bite size pieces.<br>
<strong>Kagari:</strong> There&#x27;s no use getting upset over what&#x27;s already done. I&#x27;ll have to come up with a new dinner menu... Using the ingredients I have left, I can... Eh?<br>
<strong>Kagari:</strong> Sagami-san, right now, what you&#x27;re cutting, that&#x27;s the daikon radish I bought to use for making grated radish, isn&#x27;t it?<br>
<strong>Yukina:</strong> Oh, it was? My hands were free, so I thought I&#x27;d cut it. You should be thanking me then.<br>
<strong>Kagari:</strong> But, when it&#x27;s cut into such small bits, I can&#x27;t make grated radish from it...<br>
<strong>Yukina:</strong> So what!? If you&#x27;re going to complain, then you should have put your name on it from the start.<br>
<strong>Kagari:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> Kagari-senpai, I just went and cut up the stuff that was around here, but what can I make with this?<br>
<strong>Kagari:</strong> Sana, normally you decide on a menu before you begin cutting anything. Asking me to think of what you can cook in this situation is...<br>
<strong>Yukina:</strong> Well now, look who&#x27;s shying away. Isn&#x27;t it your responsibility to bring this all together, Hiiragi-san?<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> Sorry, I also thought you&#x27;d be able to pull something together from this, Kagari-senpai... I guess it&#x27;s no good after all?<br>
<strong>Kagari:</strong> Unbelievable. You two rely on me far too much to get things done.<br>
<strong>Minato:</strong> Yikes-, it&#x27;s looking even more tense in there than when the training camp started, isn&#x27;t it.<br>
<strong>Yuzuki:</strong> I&#x27;d planned on staying quiet and seeing how things progressed, but wouldn&#x27;t it be best to step in soon?<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Still, if we simply help them out here, they won&#x27;t have improved on anything. We should hold off a little longer...<br>
[Minato&#x27;s stomach growls]</p><p><strong>Kagari:</strong> Is somebody there? Please stop hiding and come out.<br>
<strong>Minato:</strong> Ahaha, you found me out, huh-. Sorry about that, we were just worried so we came to check up on you.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> You seem to be awfully at odds with each other, but do you think you can finish in time for dinner like we agreed on?<br>
<strong>Kagari:</strong> About that...<br>
<strong>Minato:</strong> It&#x27;s growling again. My stomach&#x27;s so empty I just can&#x27;t wait anymore-. Kagari-, if you don&#x27;t make me some food soon, my stomach&#x27;s gonna growl so hard it breaks.<br>
<strong>Kagari:</strong> You say that, but... I can&#x27;t come up with anything to make from these carelessly chopped up ingredients.<br>
<strong>Yuzuki:</strong> You&#x27;re right, I&#x27;m at a loss of what to do here. It&#x27;d be a challenge finding a menu that could make use of all these...<br>
<strong>Minato:</strong> You&#x27;re kidding... But there&#x27;s all this food in front of me-.<br>
<strong>Minato:</strong> Ahh-, I got it! I just came up with a crazy good idea!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="3-the-end-result-of-dinner-is"></a>3: The End Result of Dinner is...<a class="hash-link" href="#3-the-end-result-of-dinner-is" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Yuzuki:</strong> A good idea? Minato, what did you come up with?<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Did you think of some way to resolve this situation?<br>
<strong>Minato:</strong> Yep, yep. And here I&#x27;ll show you how it&#x27;s done!<br>
<strong>Minato:</strong> We&#x27;ll take the ingredients here, every last one, and toss them in a hotpot!<br>
<strong>Kagari:</strong> Hotpot...? I see.<br>
<strong>Yuzuki:</strong> That&#x27;s true, with a hotpot, we can cook a variety of ingredients together into something that tastes good.<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> Leave it to Minato-senpai!<br>
<strong>Yukina:</strong> With a strong enough appetite helping her, even Minato-senpai can come up with a good idea sometimes.<br>
<strong>Minato:</strong> C&#x27;mon~, it wasn&#x27;t that good.<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> Uh, Minato-senpai, that wasn&#x27;t a compliment.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> At any rate, we don&#x27;t have much time to prepare dinner, so starting now let&#x27;s all work together regardless of class.<br>
<strong>Kagari/Yukina/Sana:</strong> Right.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Kagari, I&#x27;ll be getting the broth together, so come help me.<br>
<strong>Yukina:</strong> Yukari-onee-samaa, if you need help, I&#x27;ll do it for youu~.<br>
<strong>Kagari:</strong> I don&#x27;t feel quite right leaving you in charge of the flavor. I know the way they make it in the Origami househould, so I&#x27;ll help with this.<br>
<strong>Yukina:</strong> What&#x27;s with you!? I just want to cook with Onee-sama too, okay!<br>
<strong>Minato:</strong> Yukina, if you&#x27;re free, come help me out. We&#x27;ll chop up the leftover veggies together.<br>
<strong>Yukina:</strong> Why do I have to be with Minato-senpai...<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Yukina, right now, what we need to do is cooperate to finish making dinner. Please go lend Minato a hand.<br>
<strong>Yukina:</strong> If you&#x27;re the one asking me, Onee-sama, then I&#x27;ll do my best~.<br>
<strong>Minato:</strong> Hey, now you&#x27;re looking motivated. So then, Yukina, let&#x27;s have a contest to see who can chop them up the fastest!<br>
<strong>Yukina:</strong> Why would we compete... Still, if that&#x27;s how it is, then there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;ll lose.<br>
<strong>Kagari:</strong> (Incredible, as soon as everyone decided on a goal and began to cooperate, the cooking is quickly coming along... That&#x27;s the effect teamwork has...)<br>
<strong>Minato:</strong> Whoa-, there&#x27;s a kotatsu waiting for us-!<br>
<strong>Yuzuki:</strong> While everyone was preparing dinner, Sana and I got one ready. It looks like the hotpot is done too, so before we begin eating, let&#x27;s hear an overview of today&#x27;s efforts from our captain.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> You all did well our first day of the training camp. Our objective at this camp is to improve our teamwork, and...<br>
[Minato&#x27;s stomach growls]</p><p><strong>Minato:</strong> Yukari-, I can&#x27;t take it anymore! Can&#x27;t we talk about this while we&#x27;re eating? Let&#x27;s eat already-.<br>
<strong>Kagari:</strong> Minato-senpai. Honestly, you&#x27;re so...<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Though, Minato may have the right idea here. Everyone, go ahead and eat up so you can be ready for tomorrow&#x27;s practice.<br>
<strong>Kagari/Yukina/Sana:</strong> Let&#x27;s eat.<br>
<strong>Minato:</strong> Mmm~, so good~! You can&#x27;t have winter without a hotpot, am I right?<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> Hafu, hafu<em>... That&#x27;s right! Ah, the bits of radish Yukina-senpai chopped up all small soaked up the flavor and taste really good.	[</em>The sound people make while eating something good, but hot, trying to breathe in through their mouth to cool it down. Onomatopoeia is hard.]<br>
<strong>Yukina:</strong> Of course they do, because I&#x27;m the one who chopped them up. Hafu, hafu... Oh, these slices of fish are delicious too!<br>
<strong>Kagari:</strong> Those would be the fish Sana chopped up by mistake. It turned out for the best not using it to make nimono.<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> Eheheh, I guess I was right for getting it wrong then.<br>
<strong>Minato:</strong> Wait-, the three on the underclassman team, they&#x27;re acting all close out of nowhere digging into the hotpot.<br>
<strong>Yuzuki:</strong> It&#x27;s hard to imagine the tense atmosphere they had earlier.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> As they say, those who eat out of the same pot stay close. I&#x27;m relieved to see the training camp is already producing results.<br>
<strong>Minato:</strong> (Oh, I&#x27;m glad that Yukari-sama is feeling relieved. I wasn&#x27;t sure if we would make it for a moment, but we were saved this time thanks to Minato-senpai&#x27;s idea.)<br>
