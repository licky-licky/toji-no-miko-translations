<strong>Maki:</strong> Suzuka, it went that way!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Leave it to me.<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> OO OOoo o...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Oh? Is that the end of them?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Seems like it. I expected this to be tougher, but I&#x27;m glad we eliminated them quickly.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> We should be able to make it back sooner than planned. Since we&#x27;re so far out in the mountains, let me confirm our location on my phone.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Oh my! Maki-san, will you look at this map? On the way back to the Origami household is...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Did something happen?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yes, something big. An amusement park!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Amusement park? That&#x27;s all...? Don&#x27;t scare me like that.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Maki-san, this is a rare opportunity, so would you like to go visit it together?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Where&#x27;s this coming from, Suzuka?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> We all need some relaxation every now and then.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Ha... That&#x27;s the sort of thing Yume would say.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Though, we did finish our mission early, so it can&#x27;t hurt. Let&#x27;s go see what it&#x27;s like.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Hang on, Suzuka. Shouldn&#x27;t we take a little break?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Is that all it takes to tire out Shidou Maki, first seat of the elite guard?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> No, I still have plenty of stamina to go. But your clothes and hair are still wet from the water coaster, aren&#x27;t they? Here, I&#x27;ll use my handkerchief.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Oh, you&#x27;re right about that.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Fufu, thank you very much. Your hair is wet too, Maki-san. Let me use my handkerchief.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Thanks. I didn&#x27;t think there&#x27;d be that much water splashing down, but the intensity of it all was exciting.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> You don&#x27;t mean you were scared, do you?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Of course not. I wouldn&#x27;t be scared by something like that...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> You say that, Maki-san, but you were screaming so loud on the roller coaster, remember?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Haha, oh, that? That wasn&#x27;t fear; just my kind of etiquette.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Isn&#x27;t screaming on a thrill ride the highest form of respect to its creator? That&#x27;s why, when I&#x27;m enjoying one, I let it all out and scream as much as I can.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Fufu, I don&#x27;t think you need to be that conscientious... But, it&#x27;s quite like you.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> You know, with the two of us having a good time like this, we must look like ordinary high school girls.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> You&#x27;re right. It&#x27;s been a long while since we had the time to purely play around like this. What should we ride next?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> That&#x27;s true. Next, let&#x27;s get on the merry go round.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> You have some unexpectedly girlish tastes, you know.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Horseriding has always been one of my specialities since I was young, so I&#x27;d like to take this chance to show my skills...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Well I&#x27;d love to see that. Let&#x27;s go, come on.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Ah, you took, my hand...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> What&#x27;s wrong, Suzuka? Your face is red. Are you feeling sick?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I-I feel just fine.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Good then.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Hm? My phone&#x27;s ringing. Yes, this is Shidou Maki. More aradama? Understood, we&#x27;ll be right there.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Suzuka, aradama have appeared in the area. We need to deal with them.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> What unromantic aradama, arriving at a time like this.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> If we defeat them and head right back, we should still have time to go on rides.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> That&#x27;s right, let&#x27;s get them taken care of!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="2-how-toji-enjoy-an-amusement-park"></a>2: How Toji Enjoy an Amusement Park<a class="hash-link" href="#2-how-toji-enjoy-an-amusement-park" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Kanami:</strong> Hiyori-chan, check it out! They have a roller coaster, and go karts, and even a water coaster!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Mai&#x27;s parents are impressive, knowing the owners of such a large amusement park.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I wish Mai-chan and the rest could&#x27;ve come with us...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Mai said she had plans with her family, so there&#x27;s nothing we can do about it. And Kaoru, Ellen, and Sayaka are all on missions.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> She already gave us the tickets, so we should enjoy this place to its fullest and have something good to tell Mai about later.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> That&#x27;s a good point. We need to have enough fun for all of them!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Still, don&#x27;t let your guard down, Kanami. We might be off duty, but if aradama appear, we should help deal with them right away.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah, of course!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Good. Then, what should we ride first?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ahaha, you&#x27;re getting into it too, aren&#x27;t you, Hiyori-chan?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> W-We came all this way to the amusement park, so of course we&#x27;re going to ride something.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> You&#x27;re right. So why don&#x27;t we get on the roller coaster first?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Mm, that&#x27;s not a bad idea.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Alright! Let&#x27;s go.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Oi, wait, Kanami! You&#x27;re leaving me behind.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> That was one intense roller coaster, especially when it went up high.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah. I was screaming so much my throat&#x27;s sore. My eyes are all dried out too.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Nn? Your eyes are dry?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> While we were riding, I didn&#x27;t want to blink, so I kept my eyes open the whole time.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...Why would you do that?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Roller coasters go so fast, so I figured, if I don&#x27;t close my eyes, wouldn&#x27;t I be able to train my dynamic vision?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> It&#x27;ll turn into swordfighting experience, I&#x27;m sure of it! Roller coasters are so much fun!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Your idea of fun is definitely wrong...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Well whatever. What should we ride next?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Why don&#x27;t we go in the haunted house? It&#x27;s a different kind of thrill than a rollercoaster.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> A different thrill...? That sounds profound. Let&#x27;s go in.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> It was all bark and no bite, that haunted house.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Hiyori-chaaaan~... A haunted house isn&#x27;t the kind of attraction you go in to fight the ghosts!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> It&#x27;s not?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> You&#x27;re supposed to get scared when you see the ghosts, but you shouted &quot;There you are, ghost!&quot; and tried to beat them. You&#x27;re the one who scared me.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> But, if they&#x27;re going to threaten us, it&#x27;s our right to fight back.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> You&#x27;re the one who doesn&#x27;t know how to have fun, Hiyori-chan...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah, phone call.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Yes, this is Etou Kanami. ...Okay, understood.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Hiyori-chan, there was an aradama outbreak near here!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> I see. That haunted house was a good warmup. Let&#x27;s go!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Hm? Isn&#x27;t that Kiyoka and Mirja over there?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Etou Kanami, Juujou Hiyori. Were you also on your way to defeat the aradama that appeared?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah, they just called me about it. We happened to be nearby, so we could come deal with it right away. Were you two also in the area?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> We came to look into the Akabane swords around here.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> It would be reassuring, having the two of you with us. Let&#x27;s head toward the scene.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="3-we-cant-be-seen"></a>3: We Can&#x27;t Be Seen?<a class="hash-link" href="#3-we-cant-be-seen" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Mirja:</strong> All clear, extermination complete.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Pant, pant... We managed to beat them...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I&#x27;m glad we ran into you, Musumi-san, Kitora-san. Hiyori-chan, it&#x27;s not closing time yet, is it?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> It should still be open.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Open? What are you talking about?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> There&#x27;s an amusement park near here that we were playing in.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> We have tickets that are valid for today only, but the others were all too busy to come.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That doesn&#x27;t surprise me. An amusement park, huh... That sounds like fun...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> If you want, you and Kitora-san should come with us!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Can we?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> We have enough tickets for four people. And it&#x27;d make Mai happy to know they didn&#x27;t go to waste.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Then I want to go!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Mirja-san, we took care of the aradama, so...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I see nothing wrong with it. Our mission is completed, and this is a good stopping point, so we may as well.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Yes!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> They&#x27;re closing soon, so we should race back there!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Okay!<br>
At that time, the two from the elite guard were--</p><p><strong>Suzuka:</strong> We made it back safely before the park closed.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> It&#x27;s a good thing we dealt with them so quickly.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> You seemed stronger than usual today, Suzuka. Did you want to ride the merry go round that badly?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I always put all my efforts into suppressing aradama.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Right, that was rude of me. Anyway, we&#x27;re back now, so let&#x27;s pick up where we left off.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> And this is the place. Ready to show me those horseriding skills you&#x27;re so proud of?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Of course; let&#x27;s get on that white horse over there. Hah-!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Huh?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Over there, isn&#x27;t that... Shidou-san and Konohana-san!?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Wha, am I hallucinating?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> The Shidou Maki and Konohana Suzuka are...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Laughing and riding the merry go round together...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah-, they&#x27;re getting off. Hide!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> I went along with it and hid, but...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Why should we need to hide?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Sorry, I just felt like we saw something we weren&#x27;t supposed to be seeing...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Well why don&#x27;t we just watch them like this for a while?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I had a good time on the merry go round. On top of that, I now have this photo of Maki-san riding a white horse to make as my phone&#x27;s background.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Wh-When did you take that picture!? If anybody else saw me like that...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> And with this, I have Maki-san&#x27;s weakness in the palm of my hand.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> You wouldn&#x27;t!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Ufufu, I&#x27;m only joking~.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> They&#x27;re like completely different people from when they&#x27;re fighting...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah, they look like they&#x27;re having a good time. Why don&#x27;t we try calling out to them and joining up?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Etou Kanami, that wouldn&#x27;t be very tactful of you. The two of them must rarely get to spend time like this together, so we shouldn&#x27;t disturb them.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Ahh, I agree... I have no idea how I&#x27;m supposed to react to them...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Mmmm, that&#x27;s a good point. Then, why don&#x27;t we go ride something else?  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="4-its-always-a-serious-competition"></a>4: It&#x27;s Always a Serious Competition<a class="hash-link" href="#4-its-always-a-serious-competition" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> So many attractions look like fun that I can&#x27;t make up my mind. What can the four of us do together...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah! Let&#x27;s race the go karts over there! It&#x27;d be cool to have a showdown with each other.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> A showdown? That could be good.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I agree, I&#x27;ll join in.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> If everyone wants to do it... Me too.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Hmm... I thought it would be more intended for children, but that looks like a proper course.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> The kart&#x27;s frames look to be the latest model. This should be a good environment for a conclusive showdown.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Are we going to be driving these...? I wonder how safe it is...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Musumi-san, you can drive as safely as you feel like.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> That&#x27;s right, you shouldn&#x27;t feel pressured to drive any faster than you&#x27;re comfortable with. Just go at your own pace.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> However-- I&#x27;m going on an all out offensive. I&#x27;ll start from the innermost track. Does anyone mind?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Eh? Does it matter where you start from? They all go the same way.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> That&#x27;s naive, Kiyoka. Starting closer to the inside gives you a shorter route to the goal. You need to take the course considering the fundamentals of racing.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ooh, Hiyori-chan&#x27;s eyes are lighting up like when she&#x27;s going into battle...!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Wait, then I want to start from the inside too! I won&#x27;t lose to Hiyori-chan!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> We should do a game of rock-paper-scissors to decide who starts there.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Hm... Fine then. Our showdown begins with rock-paper-scissors. There&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m losing.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Me neither!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> (Wow... Those two, they&#x27;re so serious about this...)<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Hm? By the way, what happened to Mirja? I haven&#x27;t seen her since we got here...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Excuse me, I kept you waiting.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Where&#x27;d you go, Mirja-san?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> To the park office, so I could borrow some tools.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Tools? For what?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> For modifying the engine.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ehh!?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> In the world of competition, it&#x27;s only natural to take every available avenue towards seizing victory.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> I get it... Not just thinking of where you start, but the machine you start in. Not bad, Mirja.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Should you really be impressed by that!?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> This is looking like an even more dangerous competition than I thought...<br>
At the same time, Maki and Suzuka were walking nearby--</p><p><strong>Suzuka:</strong> That&#x27;s an incredible noise they&#x27;re making.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> That must be the engines of the go karts over there.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Th-They&#x27;re fast! I didn&#x27;t think karts these days could reach those speeds.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I want to try driving one, but the park&#x27;s about to close.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> In that case, why not come back here again? We were on a mission today, so we&#x27;re still in uniform, but we can dress up and come back next time we have a day off!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Ahh, I&#x27;d like that.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="5-amusement-park-memories"></a>5: Amusement Park Memories<a class="hash-link" href="#5-amusement-park-memories" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Yui:</strong> Oh yeah, Kiyoka-chan, when the investigation team has time off, where do you go for fun?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Hmm... Everyone gets different days off, so it&#x27;s hard getting us all together.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah, but not too long ago, I went with Mirja-san to an amusement park after a mission.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Mirja-san went to an amusement park!? I&#x27;d never have guessed you&#x27;re into those!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I&#x27;m willing to go to amusement parks. And, at the time, Etou Kanami and Juujou Hiyori offered us tickets.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Oh, really? That sounds like a good time, everyone at the amusement park.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Yes! It was! You should come with us next time, Yui-chan!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ah... Sorry! I&#x27;m super happy you invited me, but I won&#x27;t go to amusement parks...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Eh? Why not?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Are you not good with the rides?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> It&#x27;s not like that...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> To tell the truth, for years now, my little sister&#x27;s been sick in the hospital.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> When she was first starting elementary school, we went to an amusement park together.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> But she was still really short at the time, so she couldn&#x27;t ride the roller coaster.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> So on the way home, I promised her that, when she&#x27;s tall enough to ride, we&#x27;d go together again.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> ...But my little sister isn&#x27;t ready for that promise yet.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Even now, she still brings it up. When she&#x27;s better, she wants to go with me.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> So I made up my mind too; that until she&#x27;s feeling better I won&#x27;t go to an amusement park with anyone.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Is that a form of offering?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Offering...? What do you mean?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> When making a prayer, you vow to give up something you enjoy. The idea is that through abstinence, your prayer becomes stronger.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I see~! That&#x27;s sort of like it! I must be feeling superstitious.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> ...Hey, cut it out, you two. You don&#x27;t have to go feeling all sorry for my sake~.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> After all, there&#x27;s not a doubt in my mind my sister&#x27;s going to get better!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> So once she gets out of the hospital, let&#x27;s all go to an amusement park together!<br>
