We'll be working together from now on. Let's get along.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Onee-san, you won Yukari-sama's tournament twice, right? So you must be really strong. We should fight!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Right off the bat, huh. Looks like our new recruit's a lively one.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> But unfortunately, I can't right now. There's an aradama suppression mission I need to help with.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Then I'll go with you. We'll have a fight to see who can beat the most aradama!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> You mean a competition to see who has the highest aradama killcount?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Sounds interesting enough, but without orders to let you come, I can't let you join my unit.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh-!? Just for a little while! If you won't let me, I'm gonna follow you anyway, okay!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Geez, a real lively kid after all... Well, since you're strong enough to make it into the elite guard, you should be able to handle yourself out there.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Yeah, yeah! I'll be super useful, actually! So let's compete! C'mon, compete with me!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> ...Alright. It seems like a good chance to see what the new recruit's capable of. Okay, I'll accept your challenge!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Hooray-! After I beat you, Maki onee-san, I'll be the first seat!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> There-! That's the last aradama down-!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> You were incredible, Yume. You must have taken out half the aradama on this mission by yourself.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ehehe! So that means I won, right?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Yep. I didn't get anywhere near as many as you.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Hooray-! I beat Maki onee-san-!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> I'm surprised by just how strong you are at your age. With you around, the elite guard has a bright future.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> So since I beat you, Maki onee-san, that makes me the first seat now, doesn't it!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Well no, the seats just show the order everyone joined in. So no matter how strong you are, you're the fourth seat, Yume.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Huhh!? Really!? I tried so hard, but it's like I still lost-! You should have made it clearer from the start! Sheesh-!  </p><h2 id="2-shopping-with-yume" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>2: Shopping with Yume</h2><p><strong>Yume:</strong> Yaaay! We all managed to go shopping together in Harajuku today-!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> You were very insistent. But I still don't understand why you wanted me to come...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Because it's more fun with more people!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> What a fancy looking shop. Yume, you wanted to buy your Ichigo Daifuku Neko goods here, didn't you?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Yeah! Stickers for my scabbard, and stuffed animals!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Just be aware of how much money you have to spend.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Okaaay! Let's see, I'll get three of this stuffed animal, so I can have each color...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Oh, but I don't have enough money to get more than one...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> They're just different colors. One should be enough.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Okay... But they're all so cute. I don't know which one to buy...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> ...Well, if you can't make up your mind, I'll have to buy one of them.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Really!? Thank you, Maki onee-san!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> You're too soft on her, Maki-san... I suppose that leaves me no choice but to buy another one.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Hooray! That means I can have all of them now! I love you, onee-sans!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> A stuffed animal is a small price to pay to see you looking so delighted, Yume.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Anyway, is there anything else you need? We all came out to Harajuku together, so I'll help you buy whatever you want.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I only wanted stickers and the stuffed animals today, so I don't need to buy anything else!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> O-Okay, if you're fine with that...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> --Ah! I know just the thing!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> If that's all you wanted here, why don't we stop by that ice cream shop?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> It seems they offer waffle cones? I'll pay for yours!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> I like the sound of that. I'll go order a triple scoop.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Hey, Maki-san! Please don't go stealing your way into my idea!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Well, the one I'll be getting is a triple scoop of chocolate mint, anyway. Ahahaha.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Eww, that stuff tastes like toothpaste though! I don't want any-!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ...Shidou-san and Konohana-san are like an old couple spoiling their grandchild...  </p><h2 id="3-yumes-unreasonable-request" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>3: Yume's Unreasonable Request</h2><p><strong>Yume:</strong> Sigh... This is so boring... Yukari-sama's gone, and the other guards won't play with me...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Hey-, hey-, Kazumi onee-san and Wakako onee-san. Tell me a funny story.<br><strong>Wakako:</strong> Eh-!? I can't come up with anything when you ask so suddenly...!<br><strong>Kazumi:</strong> I'm sorry. Nothing comes to mind.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh~!? You two're so lame~! Hmm, then... Tell me if you two have a crush on anyone!<br><strong>Wakako:</strong> Ehh!? W-We don't have to tell you that...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Huh, what's that? The way you reacted says you do have a crush on someone, right, Wakako onee-san?<br><strong>Wakako:</strong> Ugh...! ...N-No comment.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Hmm? Fine, be that way. Now it's your turn, Kazumi onee-san!<br><strong>Kazumi:</strong> Maki-sama is the one I long for.<br><strong>Wakako:</strong> Without any hesitation!?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Eh-! So Kazumi onee-san likes Maki onee-san!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> --Now back to you, Wakako onee-san. Who do you like? Is it someone I know?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> If you don't say who, I'll use my position as the fourth seat of the elite guard to get you fired~.<br><strong>Wakako:</strong> Ughh...!?<br><strong>Wakako:</strong> (I'd rather die than say who, but to get fired over such a reason...)<br><strong>Maki:</strong> --Hey, Yume! Stop bothering them!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ah, Maki onee-san!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> I can't believe you. Whenever you don't have a mission, you just go around annoying people. This causes trouble for me too, you know?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> But I'm so bored!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Really? If you're that bored, then I'll have you cleaning the office daily from now on. I was just looking for someone to take care of that.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh-!? No way! I don't wanna have to clean the office!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> I know a few other places you can clean then. The entrance hall, the hallways, the bathrooms, and then there's...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> ...I'm leaving-!!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> She ran away, huh.<br><strong>Wakako:</strong> --You scared her off.<br><strong>Kazumi:</strong> You're so dependable, Maki-sama.  </p><h2 id="4-yumes-adult-appeal" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>4: Yume's Adult Appeal</h2><p><strong>Yume:</strong> Aghh-! She told me again that I can't go on a mission because I'm a kid!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> This is so boring! Even though I'm the strongest in the elite guard...!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I'll just have to show Yukari-sama I can be as adult as anyone else!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> But how do I do that... If I put on makeup, that'd make me look more adult, right?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> --I know! I'll just ask the other guards!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> ...So anyway, what do you all think I need to do to be an adult?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Starting with Yomi onee-san, what's your idea!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ...An adult is someone who pays taxes, aren't they?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> That's certainly a very grounded view of it...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> But I can agree with that.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Well that's easy! I'll make sure to pay taxes! Now it's your turn, Suzuka onee-san!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Being an adult is about the way you speak, isn't it?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yume speaks in a very childish manner. You should at least speak more respectfully around Yukari-sama.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> That's right. I'd be interested in seeing you try it too.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Hm, hmm... Last up, Maki onee-san!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Normally, you'd think someone's a kid because of their height, right?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> But Yume can't exactly go about changing that in a single day.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Though if she wears high heels, it could make a slight difference.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Let's see... So if I put together all your ideas...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I just need to go to Yukari-sama wearing high heels, and ask something like "Would you please examine this?" while showing her proof I paid taxes!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> You should really just give up on this.  </p><h2 id="5-yume-vs-kanami" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>5: Yume vs Kanami</h2><p><strong>Yume:</strong> --I finally get to fight you, Onee-san. I've been waiting so long for this.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> You're the one from the elite guard we fought before...! What are you doing here...?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Wanna fight me, Onee-san? I think you're probably stronger than anyone.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> So if I beat you, no one will be able to forget how amazing I am!<br><strong>Kanam:</strong> ...Mm, okay. I wanted to settle things with you anyway.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Then let's get started right now!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> --Hah!!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> So aggressive...! And those pointed strikes...! This is some advanced Ten'nen Rishin-Ryu!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ahahahaha-! You're having fun, right-!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah! You're really interesting! Now it's my turn--<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Haaaaaahh-!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Pant... Pant... ...It's no good. Whatever I do, I can't beat you, Onee-san.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> You're so strong though, Yume-chan! Fighting you was so much fun!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> ...Mm. I had a lot of fun fighting you too, Onee-san!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> By the way, those stickers and that strap on your scabbard are super cute! That's Ichigo Daifuku Neko, right?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Yeah! My onee-sans in the elite guard bought them for me!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Do you like Ichigo Daifuku Neko too?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I love it! I like anything that's cute!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Really! Then you should come shopping with me next time!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Okay! Sounds like fun! I'll invite Mai-chan and Mihono-chan, and we can all go together!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> ...Hey, Onee-san. If we met differently, would we have been friends?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Of course we would have! And rivals too!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> If we went to school together, I'd challenge you to fights every day! I can't wait to see more of your swordsmanship!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> School together... Huh. Fufu... That sounds really fun.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> But that's why... It's too bad... It makes it even worse...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> What's so bad about it? It's not too late, you know! We can still be friends!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> ...Hey, Onee-san. Don't forget about me, okay...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> ...I won't! I could never forget you!<br><div><iframe width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g3DcgmFmPik"></iframe></div><br><strong>Furisode Part 1:</strong> Yume's First Shrine Visit of the Year<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Whoa~, there's so many people. Do we really have to wait in line here?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> My, weren't you the one saying you wanted to make your first shrine visit of the year?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I did, but~... I just wanted to go with you onee-sans.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> In that case, do you want to come back later? I get the feeling we'll freeze standing in line with all these people.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I can go buy something to warm us. Ah, they're handing out sweet sake over there.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Sweet sake...? That sure would warm us right up.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Since we have the opportunity, we may as well take some. I'll go with you, Yomi-san.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> W-Wait, wait, wait! Sweet sake's no good!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Oh, do you not like sweet sake? Perhaps we can find something else for you, Yume.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> That's not what I meant! It's not that I don't want it; it's you onee-sans who can't have it!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> But I don't dislike sweet sake?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> You don't understand... Aghh, the shrine visit!  Let's just do the shrine visit already, before more people show up!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Sigh~, we're finally done~.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Was that really enough? You hardly prayed for more than three seconds.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> That's all I needed. I didn't want to wish for anything from the gods anyway.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Anyhow, Maki-onee-san and Suzuka-onee-san sure are taking their time~.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> About those two, they asked me to tell you they went looking to buy charms.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Charms? ...Hehe, then this works out great. Come with me for a minute, Yomi onee-san!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Now's our chance to get something to eat from the stalls!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> We're buying something from the stalls?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Yup! What should we get~? Do you know what Maki-onee-san and Suzuka-onee-san like?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I don't. Come to think of it, what do they like to eat?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Yomi-onee-san, I can't count on you for anything~. Oh well, maybe strawberry mochi will work~.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I don't think anyone is selling strawberry mochi... Why did you want to know what the two of them like to eat?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Hehehe, that's a secret for now~... Oh, I got a great idea! I'll just buy some of everything, and you can help me carry it all, Yomi onee-san.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Sorry for the wait... Why do you have all that?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Your arms are full with... Is that food?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Yup. I'm giving all these to you onee-sans, as a gift.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> A gift?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Thank you, onee-sans. If it weren't for you two, we wouldn't be able to do our first shrine visit together.<br><strong>Furisode Part 2:</strong> Thank You<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Thank you, onee-sans. If it weren't for you two, we wouldn't be able to do our first shrine visit together.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> It's rare hearing you say thanks...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Come on! Just listen to me!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Maki-san, give Yume a chance to talk.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> You're right. Sorry Yume. I didn't mean to make fun of you.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I'm talking about something serious here, okay?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> I know. I'll hear what you have to say. So Yume, what are you thanking us for?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Geez, you're so dense~.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> It's because of you onee-sans that I got to do my first shrine visit this year!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> That's why, thanks. It's really fun, visiting the shrine with you!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> ...I see, I'm having fun too, Yume.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> And I as well.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> That's good then~. Here! Have as much as you want!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Since Yume went out of her way to buy all this for us, why don't we find somewhere quiet to enjoy it.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I actually wanted to secretly buy the things you liked, but... I didn't know what to get, so I just bought a whole lot of stuff.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Fufu, that's very like you. Thank you, Yume.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> There's nothing I'd like more than whatever you'd buy for me.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Why are you the one thanking me? That's weird, isn't it? I mean, I'm the one who should be thankful.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> No, let me say it too. Thank you for being here to visit the shrine with us, Yume.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Why are you thanking me now, Maki-onee-san!? This is weird, right? Yomi-onee-san!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ...I'm the only one who hasn't said anything. Thank you all. Shidou-san, Konohana-san, Tsubakuro-san.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Not you too, Yomi-onee-san!?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Fufu. You want to go flower viewing again this year as well, don't you, Yume?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Nn, I want to go, but... No sweet sake this time, okay?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> ...Fireworks, maybe at the summer festival, would be nice too, wouldn't it? I'd rather see them together than alone this time.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Fireworks!? I really wanna see that!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Isn't there anything you want to do this year, Tsubakuro-san?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> What I want to do...? Oh yeah! Seeing the autumn leaves!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Understood. We can all go together.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> And, what else~. I still have to beat Yukari-sama, so a whole bunch of people can see how great I am!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> There's a lot you want to do, isn't there. Shouldn't you have wished to the gods about it then?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh~? I don't have to do that~. Cause...

I want to thoroughly drill myself on all the game commands, just in case a bug occurs in the game world.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Shidou-san, I understand why you might feel unsure of using cutting edge technology, but I can assure you, this VR game Kitora-san and I helped to develop is perfectly safe. You have nothing to worry about.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> That's right-, they say it's popular with other toji onee-sans too, so it's fine.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Still, since they say it's an action shooting game, there's no way to avoid battling enemies, is there? If worse comes to worst, and I end up losing with a weapon I'm not used to...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Come on-, you take everything way too seriously, Maki-onee-san-.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I have to agree. There is a battle stage in this VR game, but exploring the city is the main objective, so that won't be an issue.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> See, this onee-san's saying the same thing. Let's get started already-.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Just hang on! Only another 20 pages and I'll have finished the manual...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> With these things, it's easy to just learn while playing-. Isn't it, Onee-san?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I believe that everyone learns in different ways. Tsubakuro-san, if you're ever in trouble, please ask Shidou-san for the commands.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Okaaay! Maki-onee-san, as soon as you're ready, we're going in!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Wow-! Look, look! The city's all sparkly and pretty-. Ah, there's something up on the roof of that building! Let's go check it out!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Hey, Yume! Wait for me! You can't run off on your own!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ahaha! This is funnn! I know! Let's climb up to the top of that really high building! Hurry up, Maki-onee-san-!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Hold on, I'll be right there! ...You know, while we're here, this world is incredible. We can jump ten times higher than usual. We got to the top of a high rise building in no time.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ahh! There's a helicopter parked on the roof of the next building over! Think I can jump to there?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Oi, hold it, Yume! Even here, a jump that far is going to be...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Err... What was the long distance jump command...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I don't believe it-! Maki-onee-san, you even brought the instruction manual in here?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> There's times when we'll need to have it handy. Just hold on, Yume, I'm checking over the commands now...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Don't worry, it's easy peasy!  Here I gooo-! Juuump!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Ahh-- Yume!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> See, look! I jumped to this roof just fine-! You come too, Maki-onee-san-.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Whoa! What's with the strength of this wind!? It'll be tough reaching there through this.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> I'll go after it dies down. Oiii, Yume, just to be sure, find somewhere safe to get out of the wind.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I'll be fine-. See, if I go all the way into the corner of the roof, I can get a really pretty view of the city at night down bel...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Wah----!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Yume!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> No way! I'm falling!?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Uhh, when this happens, what was I supposed to do? What do I do, Maki-onee-san!?

I'll take us down slowly, so don't leave my arms.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Okay, thanks... Wait, what! Maki-onee-san, you're flying!? How? How-?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> In this game world, there's a command to fly through the air.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ehhh!? Nobody told me that-!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> It was written in the instruction manual. You should have read it.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Boo-. Instead of reading that big book, it seemed like it'd be faster learning by trying it yourself-.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Sure, even if you memorize the manual, if you can't handle the controls when the time comes, there wasn't much point.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Still, it's because you took reading it so seriously that you saved me.

We've landed safely.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ahh~, thank goodness!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Hey hey, teach me how to fly in the sky too!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Of course; it'd be dangerous if this happened again, after all. Watch me closely. You do this...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Okay, okay, like this?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Whoa-, that's crazy! I'm flying too!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> You're a natural, Yume. Just after seeing that complicated command one time, you already memorized it.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Hey hey, since I can fly now and all, well, I'm going to fly up to the top of the highest building!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> It does seem pretty high up there. Though, while we're in this world, we might as well enjoy it.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Wow-, it's super high up here on the roof! You can see all the night lights in the city-.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Oi, Yume! If you walk on the edge of the building, you're going to fall like before!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I'm fine, I'm fine! Cause I can fly now!

I just can't settle down.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> The ryokan Yume left for has been hosting students of the Five Traditions for their workplace experience for years.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> We only asked if they would kindly take in Yume, despite not being part of the Five Traditions, and Yomi-san even went along with her.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Nothing of concern is going to happen.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Well, you're right... Yeah. I'll just focus on my own work.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Tsubakuro-san, the last aradama is headed your way.

After we put on our hostess clothes, we were going to help out, but, what should we do?<br><strong>Ryokan Proprietress:</strong> The work I'll have you do is nothing more than simple cleaning of the rooms, and a check over their furnishings.<br><strong>Ryokan Proprietress:</strong> We have people hired to take care of the full cleaning, but this is one last check before the guests come through.

You won't be part of a ceremony.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> You will be giving a dance performance as part of the pool's Arabian event.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Eh...!?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Instead of listening to some boring speeches at a ceremony, we're dancing?  </p><h2 id="1001-nights---yume-end-a-promise-for-next-time" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[1,001 Nights - Yume: End]: A Promise for Next Time</h2><p>--The day of the event.</p><p><strong>Maki:</strong> We have to wear these!?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> You don't like it, Maki-onee-san?

It's embarrassing for me as well.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Why don't you want to wear it that bad though?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> It doesn't really feel like something you'd say, Maki-onee-san. You'd be more like, "All clothes are the same-!"<br><strong>Maki:</strong> ...I don't think all clothes are the same.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> And I'm just... a little self-conscious about my stomach.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> You mean cause it'll be cold?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> That's not it.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> ...Isn't my stomach way too toned compared to everybody?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> My, were you really worried about that?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> You're a real workout monster, Maki-onee-san-.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> We're out of time, everyone.

I didn't think dancing would be this fun!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> You were the one who didn't want to do this the most at first, Yume, and now you're having the most fun with it.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Isn't it charming to see her act her age?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> ...That's true.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Geez! Maki-onee-san, you're messing up the rhythm.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Huh!?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Yomi-onee-san, you've gotta smile more!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ...Was I not smiling?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> You haven't smiled for a second-!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Fufu, an event like this isn't so bad, is it, Yume.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Yeah!

What're you doing with Maki-onee-san?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> I was just hearing from her about the incident going on. What did you need, Yume?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Aradama showed up, so I came to get her. Let's go together, Fate-chan.<br><strong>Fate:</strong> Aradama...? But...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> It's fine with me. Though, when you get back, I might have to talk with you again...<br><strong>Fate:</strong> ...Thank you, Maki-san.<br><strong>Fate:</strong> If helping out could reduce the damage they cause by even a little, I'll go along with you.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Neat! I'll be sure to show you a whole bunch of how strong I am!<br><strong>Fate:</strong> Eh? But I know that you're strong, Yume-san.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I can't wait!

Why is Harlaown-san here?<br><strong>Fate:</strong> I accepted Yume-san's invitation to help.<br><strong>Nanoha:</strong> Ah, it's Fate-chan.<br><strong>Fate:</strong> Wait, Nanoha?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I asked Takamachi-san to assist me. We were working together just before this.<br><strong>Nanoha:</strong> Yomi-san was actually with us too, but she had to go someplace else.<br><strong>Fate:</strong> Is that how it happened. Let's do what we can, Nanoha.<br><strong>Nanoha:</strong> Sure, Fate-chan!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> So anyway, why're you just standing around doing nothing here?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> We were waiting for you, Tsubakuro-san.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Oh, you were? Then, you can go back and leave the rest to me, Onee-san.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I probably could-.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> We won't go back, but I'll count on you to do your best.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Sure!<br><strong>Fate:</strong> Umm... Is this going to be okay, Tsugumi-san?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Is what okay?<br><strong>Fate:</strong> The aradama... Isn't it going to be hard when they show up? I don't get that feeling from Yume-san...<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Tsubakuro-san is plenty strong though-.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Since she doesn't struggle fighting aradama, there's not much sense of danger, so perhaps a part of her merely thinks of it as an extended game.<br><strong>Fate:</strong> Then, why is it that Yume-san became a toji?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Only Tsubakuro-san knows the answer to that.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong>  Though... Everything will be fine.<br><strong>Fate:</strong> Eh?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Tsubakuro-san is a toji too.

All the people coming to the party today are toji, aren't they?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Not exactly all of them, but everyone from the Five Traditions was invited, so the majority should be toji.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> That's a lot though! So, who do you think's the strongest of them all?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I can't really tell, so I think I'll just challenge whoever I feel like!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yume, we're all here today to appreciate the flowers, not to fight amongst each other.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> That's right. And besides, our job here is to act as guards.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> We're keeping this up until late tonight, so you're going to wear yourself out if you're getting too excited first thing.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> We're doing this until night? Didn't they say we were just guarding during the day?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Oh yeah; you're only in charge of the day part, aren't you.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> The day part? So that means the party's still going on at night too?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Akane-sama proposed that we split the party into two parts, for the toji who couldn't arrive during the day due to their missions.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> She did? So wait, then, I can just be a normal guest for the night part, right?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Sure; but don't get too carried away with it.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Nice-!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ah-- There's some onee-sans over there! Heyyy!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Oh; Yume-chan! Come and look! They decorated this cake with flowers all over; isn't it cute?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Wow; it really is! --Wait, forget that, come out to the courtyard with me, Onee-san!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Huh? The courtyard? Did you want to look at the flowers together?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Not that-! There's a whole bunch of toji coming here today, so we're going to have a big match to see who's the strongest!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> That sounds cool! You'll come too, right, Hiyori-chan?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Hmm... If you say so, then I guess I have to.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> That'll be fun! Let me in too-!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Yayyy, more and more people are coming! I can fight anybody I want! So, who should I beat first-?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Hey, Yume! The moment I take my eyes off you, you're already starting something.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Our team's duty is to act as security for the venue today.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> You're meant to mingle naturally amongst the partygoers while keeping an eye on things...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Boo... But for me though, fighting with everybody's the most natural thing to do.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> You might be right, but you are on duty, at least during the day. Please bear with it.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Fiiine...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ahh, I'm so bored. They said just to enjoy the party normally, so I ate the food, and talked, and...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Yawwwn.

That's not the point!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Didn't you say how, after I was done guarding during the day, I could do what I wanted at night?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Did all the toji onee-sans really leave already?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Yeah. They all said they'd be busy with missions and training again first thing tomorrow morning.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Boo!

Right, Yomi?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Hm...? Where'd Yomi go? Did she go back to her room already?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> We should return as well. I'll have my father send more flowers next year, so we can look forward to having the party again.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Now they're all gone... Aww, and I thought this was going to be a lot of fun with everybody...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Sigh... It's just boring...<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Tsubakuro-san, you're still here. Good.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Yomi-onee-san? Didn't you go back to your room?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I thought about it, but I saw that the bar was still open.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> If you'd like, will you have a drink with me?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Whoa! This cocktail's so pretty! But, is it really okay for somebody young to drink this?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I had them make special non-alcoholic ones.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Neat! Then I'll have some!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> What's with this; it's super yummy! They didn't have this at the party, did they?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> They didn't. Since the orders had slowed down, it seems that they made extra flavorful ones for us.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> So this special cocktail's just for you and me? Thanks, Yomi-onee-san!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I'm glad to see you're feeling better now.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Next year, I want to invite even more toji, and then we can have a really exciting party!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> And then, everybody can have this cocktail there too!
