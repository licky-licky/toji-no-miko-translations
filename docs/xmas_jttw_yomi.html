I have some business I want to take care of before the end of the year, so please go without me.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Well, we can't do that. Since it's a big party, we got permission from Yukari-sama, saying we should all go.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> And Yume seems to be trying her best at getting something ready. It would be terrible if you weren't there.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Is that right... Then, I suppose I'll have to go. Is there anything I need to prepare in advance?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> It said on the invitation they're doing a gift exchange at the end of the party, so everybody needs to have one gift ready.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> With all the people that should be there, an exchange should be exciting. I should get mine ready straight away~.  
<strong>Maki:</strong> Wait up, Suzuka! I want your advice on what to go with. I'm coming with you!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> The two of them left. Sigh... A gift exchange...<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> A gift which you can't anticipate who will be receiving it... That's a fairly difficult request.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> A present that would make anyone happy... Something that, no matter how many people got it, they would be happy with... Like, for example, delicious white rice...<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Ah-! That's what I could do.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I've reached a stopping point in my duties, so I'll quickly go out to do some shopping.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I may have bought a bit too much, but I suppose I'll get right to cooking. It's a good thing the kitchen was available.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Wow! Yomiyomi! I don't often run into you in a place like this~!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Are we maybe getting in your way?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> No, it's fine so long as I can use the faucet and stove. You can use the next counter over if it's fine with you.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Thanks for that then! Though, you sure have a lot of rice. And a nice big pot.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Are you getting ready for the Christmas party or something?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes, they said we would need something for the gift exchange, so I was thinking of using a type of rice that tastes delicious when cold to make omusubi.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Wow! Now that's a coincidence~! Kiyoka and I were here to make sweets for the present exchange too.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I'm baking cookies, and Ellen-san was going to make muffins.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I see, sweets are a standard gift for schoolgirls. You do often see them decorated for Christmas on sale around town.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> To give omusubi as a Christmas present... Maybe what I'm making will be out of place.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That's not true at all! Even with onigiri, depending on how you decorate them, they can definitely be cute Christmas presents!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> That's right~! Christmas style onigiri! If I got something like that, I'd be extra happy!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Um, if it's alright, could we help you make them? We'll make a Christmas style onigiri bento!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Definitely~! I'll help with Yomiyomi's onigiri bento too!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Musumi-san, Kohagura-san, thank you both. I appreciate you wanting to help. However, what I want to make is not onigiri bento.<br><strong>Kiyoka/Ellen:</strong> Eh?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> It's omusubi bento.<br><a href="https://streamable.com/1w9itp">https://streamable.com/1w9itp</a></p><h2 id="xmas-19---yomi-end-the-fun-of-giving" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Xmas' 19 - Yomi: End]: The Fun of Giving</h2><p><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Still though, Christmas style onigi... Ah-! Omusubi! How do you think those should look?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> For cakes, something called a Buche de Noel is popular. It's a roll cake decorated to look like a log of wood.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I see, a log of wood... If it were a sushi roll, I could make it look that way.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It wouldn't be very Christmas-like though, would it.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Since it's difficult expressing Christmas through the shape...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I know! For Christmas onigi... Ah-! Omusubi! What about this? You could bring out the feeling with red and green ingredients.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Red and green... In that case, I have umeboshi and shiyazuke for red, and shiso leaves for green.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Both of those would go perfect with onigi... Rice balls!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That was a nice save, Ellen-san.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Thank you both. With your suggestions, I should be able to make these omusubi feel like Christmas.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I'm glad we could help. Then, Ellen-san, we should get to making our own sweets now.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> You're right. Though, Kiyoka, you sure have a lot of shapes for cutting cookies.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> There's Santa Claus, reindeers, stars. They all feel like Christmas!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> They're all so cute, so I couldn't help but bring them out... Ah, I know! Satsuki-san, I came up with something good!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Something good?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> If you use my cookie cutters, and cut out a bit of omelette...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Wow! That's a pretty Christmas star! If you put that with Yomiyomi's rice balls...!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> It looks beautiful... Like a Christmas tree inside the bento box.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It really is! It turned out cuter than I thought!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Whoever gets this lunch box during the gift exchance will be very happy!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Yeah! I'm sure they'll be happy with it! I'm looking forward to tomorrow.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Thank you very much. Now I won't feel uncomfortable joining the party. Then, I'll be leaving now.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Please wait a minute! Since we're exchanging gifts, it'd be a waste to leave it at that!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> For the exchange, you can't not wrap it up all cute~.  
<strong>Yomi:</strong> You do have a lot of ribbons and wrapping paper.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Maybe it would be cuter with a gap between the inside and outside! What do you think about this ribbon? Ah, or this one might be cute too!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> You always do have an awesome eye for design, Kiyoka~. Which do you like, Yomiyomi?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I... think both are fine. I'll go with whatever you choose.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Alright then! If we tie this ribbon on, it's ready!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> My omusubi became such a cute present... Musumi-san, Kohagura-san, I can't thank you enough.<br>The day of the Christmas Eve party.</p><p><strong>Mirja:</strong> Now then, for the final event of the party, all who joined us will be exchanging gifts. Everyone, do you all have your presents ready?<br><strong>Kanami/Mai/Yume:</strong> We dooo!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ......<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> What's the matter, Satsuki-san? The gift exchange is starting.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Musumi-san. Everyone seems to have brought such proper gifts, so are omusubi really alright...?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It'll be fine. I know for sure someone will be glad to get it. Aren't you excited to see the happy look on their face when they open it?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> The face they make... I hadn't thought about it, but you're right. I am a little interested.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Yomiyomi, Kiyoka! They're starting the gift exchange. Let's go over!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Alright.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> (The happy face of the person who receives it... That's the fun of giving presents, isn't it...)<br><a href="https://streamable.com/ftmkdq">https://streamable.com/ftmkdq</a></p><h2 id="journey-to-the-west---yomi-start-what-is-tsubakuro-san-going-to-do" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Journey to the West - Yomi: Start]: What Is Tsubakuro-san Going to Do?</h2><p><strong>Yukari:</strong> Satsuki. Konohana will be joining me at this evening's conference. I won't be needing an escort. You'll be assisting Shidou instead.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Understood.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Maki-san. If there's an urgent request for aid, please do all you can.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Sure, you can count on us.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> We'll be going then.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Huh-? Did Yukari-sama and Suzuka-onee-san go out somewhere?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> They just left for a conference.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh, but I thought I'd get Yukari-sama to play with me. It feels like you onee-sans have been really busy lately.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Apart from our aradama suppression missions, there's always something to take care of.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> But because of that, we haven't gotten to play at all. Or, actually, haven't we barely been able to get the four of us together lately?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> You're right. The rate of aradama appearances isn't dropping at all though. There's too much work needing toji to do it.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> If it's aradama, then I can beat as many as I have to!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> It's reassuring to have you, Tsubakuro-san, but you can't respond to aradama appearing in multiple locations at once.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Looking at the whole picture, even if you are very active, it won't reduce the overall work of toji that much.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Mmgh.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Though, I get what Yume's saying. But it's hard getting all of us time off at the same time.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Then, it'd be fine if it's not when we have time off?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ...What do you mean?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> You'll find out later~.  
<strong>Yume:</strong> There's something I've gotta go do real quick.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> What do you think she's up to?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> No idea... But, it's always a bit scary when Yume gets an idea.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Hey hey, Onee-san. There's a little something I want you do to for me, okay?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> If it's something I can manage, then I don't mind.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Y'see--<br>A few days later.</p><p><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I recieved a message from Yume earlier, but do you know what this is about, Yomi-san?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> No. I only know that, several days ago, she seemed to be planning something.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Well, we're lucky to be spending some time together, though it's only for a few hours.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> That's true. I'm slightly looking forward to it.<br><a href="https://streamable.com/l9z6n9">https://streamable.com/l9z6n9</a></p><h2 id="journey-to-the-west---yomi-end-it-might-be-nice-to-continue-our-journey" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Journey to the West - Yomi: End]: It Might Be Nice to Continue Our Journey</h2><p><strong>Maki:</strong> Hey... Yomi. What are we doing here, anyway...<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> What are you saying now, Pigsy? I'm Sandy. And we have to defeat these bandits to rescue our master.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Didn't think you'd get so into this... Uh, Sandy.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> That was a joke.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I wasn't sure what to expect when Tsubakuro-san invited us for training, but I didn't imagine we would be using the VR facilities.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> I'm still not completely used to this whole VR thing... But it's useful if you think of this as time spent strengthening the SDDT's coordination.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Though, did it really need to be done up like Journey to the West...?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> This training program seems to be popular. And also, I think Tsubakuro-san is fitting for the role of the Monkey King.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> The Monkey King's wild and uncontrollable side might be a good fit for her. Though, I'm not that on board with me being Pigsy...<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Is it bothering you? I didn't think you'd mind. I've heard that Pigsy is a popular character in China.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Is he really?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> But, right now, there's something we have to do to break our master out, Pigsy.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> That's what I mean, calling me Pigsy is... Forget it... Let's go, Sandy!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Please take point. I'll cover our backs.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> On it! We've got to make a diversion so the Monkey King can break out Master Tripitaka!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Right, let's bring these bandits to justice.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> That was a rather worthwhile training session, wasn't it.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Yeah, it was pretty fun! Though, I was pretty surprised when you started beating bad guys up halfway through, Suzuka-onee-san.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Since this was a training exercise, there was no need for a Tripitaka who did nothing but be protected, was there?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Our Master Tripitaka's highly capable, after all. Those bandits shouldn't have let their guard down.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I would have liked to have seen you two in action as well though, Pigsy, Sandy.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> In that case, should we continue this journey until the end?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I'm up for that! Let's keep going till we beat the Ox King!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Tsubakuro-san, Tripitaka's goal isn't to defeat the Ox King. We're traveling to Tianzhu... to India, to retreive the scriptures.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Oh, we are?
