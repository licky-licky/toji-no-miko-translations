Clear blue skies today, clear blue skies today. Now testing the mic, now testing the mic. Ah~, Ah~... Mm, okay!<br>
<strong>Kozue:</strong> Ahem... Acting as your host today, as well as event commentator, I&#x27;m Nishi Kozue, a 1st year engineering student in high school at Osafune Girls&#x27; Academy. And with me is--<br>
<strong>Aoto Hina:</strong> Aoto Hina, her assistant, and 2nd year high schooler studying polishing at Renpu Girls&#x27; School.<br>
<strong>Hina:</strong> By the way, did you know my family runs &quot;Aoto-kan&quot;, the sword dealership down in Tokyo&#x27;s Harajuku! Whether it&#x27;s scabbards, grips, or guards, we&#x27;ll cover all your needs!<br>
<strong>Hina:</strong> If you&#x27;re looking to give your okatana that personal touch, we&#x27;re running a limited offer right now for a whole 10% off all orders! Come on down to Aoto-kan and we&#x27;ll make it worth your while!<br>
<strong>Kozue:</strong> Ahaha... You&#x27;ve got the heart of a saleswoman... I didn&#x27;t think you&#x27;d go plugging an advertisement now!<br>
<strong>Kozue:</strong> Sorry, we&#x27;ve gotten a little off track. The reason why you&#x27;ve all been gathered here today is to participate in a certain event.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I heard this event was to make toji look more appealing?<br>
<strong>Kozue:</strong> Yes, you got it! Working as a toji is a wonderful job that helps the government and provides you with many benefits.<br>
<strong>Kozue:</strong> But the facts are, it&#x27;s also a job with many dangers. Fighting aradama is a life risking business!<br>
<strong>Hina:</strong> Because of that, and with the declining birth rate, there&#x27;s less little girls dreaming of becoming toji with every year.<br>
<strong>Hina:</strong> So the bigwigs put their heads together and came up with this event as a way of turning things around.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> What is it you want us to do exactly?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I bet they want us to fight each other live on TV! When everyone sees how intense it gets, they&#x27;ll think &quot;Toji are so cool!&quot;<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> That&#x27;s a pretty good idea, but if things got too intense, wouldn&#x27;t it scare people away?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Then, what if Mai makes cookies to hand out?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ahaha... Mai-chan&#x27;s just one person, so I don&#x27;t think she could make that many.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> So, what are we really doing?<br>
<strong>Kozue:</strong> We&#x27;re going to make you all into &quot;brides&quot;!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> B-Brides!? What do you mean; I&#x27;m only in middle school!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> If Mai dressed like one, she would look pretty...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...Why are you blushing?<br>
<strong>Hina:</strong> Don&#x27;t worry, when we say brides, we don&#x27;t mean you&#x27;ll actually be getting married!<br>
<strong>Kozue:</strong> To be precise, you&#x27;ll all be put in a competition to get your hands on a limited number of bouquets.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Competition? And what does that have to do with being a bride?<br>
<strong>Kozue:</strong> The rules are: you have 60 minutes to locate the bouquets scattered in the nearby area and return them here to the altar in this chapel. If you do that, you win!<br>
<strong>Kozue:</strong> And the winners get the right to dress up in a wedding dress!<br>
<strong>Kozue:</strong> We even have pros here who will give you a beautiful makeover! Make no mistake, this is the chance of a lifetime!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Seriously!? We really get to wear a wedding dress!?<br>
<strong>Hina:</strong> The owners of this chapel and wedding hall have gone to great lengths working with us for this PR event, so don&#x27;t worry about anything on that end!<br>
<strong>Kozue:</strong> All you sweet young girls, do your best to hunt down those bouquets! Then when the whole world sees how happy you look done up in those dresses, it&#x27;ll improve our image too.<br>
<strong>Kozue:</strong> And that&#x27;s all there is to know about this event! Film crews from each media outlet are already standing by. This is a big event, so let&#x27;s make it a success!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I don&#x27;t really get it, but it sounds fun!<br>
<strong>Hina:</strong> But don&#x27;t forget, everyone! A toji&#x27;s job is suppressing aradama! If you run into any aradama during the competition, please be mindful and take care of them!<br>
<strong>Kozue:</strong> Now, to make things fair, everyone who&#x27;s interested in participating should stay here. Those who aren&#x27;t, could I ask you to leave. The event will begin 10 minutes from now!   </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="2-the-elite-guard-enters-the-bride-battle"></a>2: The Elite Guard Enters the Bride Battle<a class="hash-link" href="#2-the-elite-guard-enters-the-bride-battle" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Kozue:</strong> All of you toji, it&#x27;s time to begin! Aoto-san, please give the signal to toss the bouquets!<br>
<strong>Hina:</strong> Understood!<br>
<strong>Hina:</strong> Okay, all staff members out around town!! Please spread those bouquets around-!!<br>
<strong>Kozue:</strong> With that, the Bride Battle for the Bouquets starts! Everyone participating, please exit the chapel and find those bouquets-!<br>
<strong>Toji A:</strong> Those bouquets are mine!<br>
<strong>Toji B:</strong> As if, they&#x27;re mine!<br>
<strong>Toji A:</strong> Funny, I know a way to make it clear who they belong to. I always figured I&#x27;d have to fight you someday!<br>
<strong>Toji B:</strong> You read my mind!<br>
<strong>Toji C:</strong> Hehe, now&#x27;s my chance!<br>
<strong>Toji A:</strong> Ah-, Wha... H-Hey, stop!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...Everyone left in a panic. They weren&#x27;t acting so sweet. Is this really going to improve our image?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ahaha... Everyone&#x27;s getting caught up in the competition because they all want to wear a wedding dress.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> It doesn&#x27;t matter what you&#x27;re competing for, of course you&#x27;ll want to win! I&#x27;m not gonna lose either!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Right? Besides, they made this whole event for us, so it&#x27;d be a waste not to enjoy ourselves! And I want to cross swords with all those toji!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah, yeah! That&#x27;s more like it!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Then, I&#x27;ll go on ahead.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> M-Munen Musou!? She&#x27;s that serious about getting a bouquet?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> If that&#x27;s how you&#x27;re going to be, then I won&#x27;t lose.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Third Layer Jin&#x27;i!? Sayaka-chan and Hiyori-chan are totally getting into it!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> We can&#x27;t let them leave us behind either, Kanami!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Mm, you&#x27;re right!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Look at them go. They&#x27;re getting all worked up, aren&#x27;t they!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> They&#x27;re making too much noise; it&#x27;s like a festival here.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> But is there really anything wrong with that? Things have been quite busy lately, so a chance to let loose might be just what they need.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Let loose, huh. Having fun is one thing, but I hope you haven&#x27;t forgotten this is a mission too?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Yeah, we know that already. You always worry about everything, Maki onee-san.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I couldn&#x27;t have put it better myself. It&#x27;s good to be dedicated to your work, but you need to learn to relax as well, Maki-san.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> You want me to ignore my responsibilities?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I didn&#x27;t say that.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I only think you shouldn&#x27;t tackle every one of your duties with the same level of intensity.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Overworking leads to impatience and opens you to making oversights. In situations such as this, it&#x27;s fine to stop taking yourself so seriously.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Yeah see, we&#x27;re here, so we might as well have fun with it! If you keep thinking too hard, you&#x27;re gonna end up with so many wrinkles on your forehead you&#x27;ll start looking like an old lady.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Ufufu, Maki-san as an old lady... In its own way, I&#x27;d be interested in seeing that.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Who&#x27;re you calling an old lady? That&#x27;s a rude thing to say to a young girl.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Oh, you&#x27;re actually aware that you&#x27;re a young girl? Now that&#x27;s surprising.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Whoa, I don&#x27;t believe it!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> J-Just what do you two think I&#x27;m like...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Anyway! In the name of the elite guard, we can&#x27;t afford to let the rest of the toji get ahead of us! I&#x27;ll see to it this mission&#x27;s successful.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Mission...? You&#x27;re taking it too seriously again...  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="3-great-minds-think-alike-though-fools-seldom-differ"></a>3: Great Minds Think Alike, Though Fools Seldom Differ<a class="hash-link" href="#3-great-minds-think-alike-though-fools-seldom-differ" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Kozue:</strong> As of now, 30 minutes have passed since the event began. A heated battle for the bouquets has been unfolding here!<br>
<strong>Kozue:</strong> We&#x27;ve seen resourcefulness, scheming, and even use of force! As they do everything they can to get those bouquets, the cracks in relationships are showing!<br>
<strong>Kozue:</strong> Ahh~, I sure hope no one will be holding any grudges after the event&#x27;s over!<br>
<strong>Hina:</strong> Don&#x27;t worry, it&#x27;s all good. Everyone&#x27;s just messing around. No one&#x27;s actually going to be losing friends over an event like this.<br>
<strong>Kozue:</strong> True, it does look like everyone&#x27;s having a good time out there! Let&#x27;s keep things fun and friendly till the finish!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Bouquet, bouquet... Where&#x27;s a bouquet? Don&#x27;t tell me everyone found them all already.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> But it&#x27;s still a while before they give the signal to stop, so it&#x27;s too soon to give up. I&#x27;ll just have to look as best I can!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Wait, huh? Is that-- I found a bouquet! Woohoo, I&#x27;m so lucky! It must have gotten stuck back here when it fell.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Now all I have to do is get this bouquet back to the altar in the chapel, right? I&#x27;ve gotta make sure no one can steal it from me!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Come to think of it, what happened to Kanami? I wonder if she found a bouquet yet?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> A wedding dress... I wonder what Kanami would look like wearing one?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> With how she usually looks, I can&#x27;t really picture it... But that&#x27;s all the more reason... Why I totally want to see it!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I&#x27;m just looking to have fun here, so it doesn&#x27;t matter if I&#x27;m not the one who gets to wear it.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> And this was fun enough already, so why don&#x27;t I give my bouquet to Kanami?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Found you, Mihono-chan!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Kanami!? ...&quot;Found me&quot;, were you looking for me?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I found a bouquet and thought I&#x27;d give it to you. You looked like you were having so much fun, Mihono-chan, so I thought you&#x27;d be glad... Or did you not want my help?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> But, Kanami, if you gave that to me then you wouldn&#x27;t get to try on a wedding dress!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Nnn~, I kinda want to, but if wearing one would make you happy, then I&#x27;d be happier that way too!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I got to see swordfighting from a lot of different toji already, so I&#x27;m satisfied with this event!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ahaha... Kanami, I am glad! So much so that I could just marry you!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> M-Mihono-chan!?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> But don&#x27;t worry about it. Look! I already got a bouquet of my own!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...See, actually, I was planning on giving this bouquet to you.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ehh, you were? ...Fufufu.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> It&#x27;s pretty funny, isn&#x27;t it? Ahahaha!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> In that case, Mihono-chan. Let&#x27;s go to the goal together!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah! Good idea! Yeah, let&#x27;s go, let&#x27;s go! The two of us together!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="4-a-white-hot-meeting-of-the-minds"></a>4: A White Hot Meeting of the Minds<a class="hash-link" href="#4-a-white-hot-meeting-of-the-minds" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Kozue:</strong> It&#x27;s already been over 30 minutes since Itomi Sayaka and Juujou Hiyori began their showdown.<br>
<strong>Kozue:</strong> Right after the event began, the two of them came across a bouquet together, and now their standoff continues!<br>
<strong>Hina:</strong> ...Take a look! Between the two of them, an invisible war is raging! It&#x27;s getting tense; neither of them can afford to let their guard down for even a second!<br>
<strong>Hina:</strong> As we speak, there must be thousands of simulations running through their heads as they plan their next move!<br>
<strong>Kozue:</strong> When it comes to a fight between two toji at top performance, they&#x27;re almost beyond our understanding!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> (This is bad...  I got carried away with the others, but now that I&#x27;ve had a chance to think about it, I don&#x27;t care about this event at all.)<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> (I have no interest in putting on that dress, and I can&#x27;t find any reason to keep going along with this.)<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> (That said, I&#x27;d hate to let it seem like I lost to Sayaka by letting her steal this bouquet from right before my eyes.)<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> (I don&#x27;t actually care about proving I&#x27;m better than her, but there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m just going to let her take it.)<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> (But I can&#x27;t tell... Just what is she thinking? Sayaka... Are you coming up with a way to outsmart me?)<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> (I&#x27;m hungry...)<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> (I feel weak. I should have brought Mai&#x27;s cookies with me.)<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> (I can&#x27;t eat the bouquet, so I would rather have cookies... But, if I gave the bouquet to Mai, she might be happy. If Mai wore a wedding dress... She would look pretty for sure...)<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> (But I&#x27;m too hungry to focus... I want to eat cookies...)<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> (Did she relax her body just now? No wait, I can&#x27;t let myself be tricked. Are you trying to bait me into lowering my guard!?)<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> (Still, as long as we keep staring each other down, I&#x27;ll keep wasting energy without having done anything. I need to find a way to end this as soon as possible!)<br>
<strong>Kozue:</strong> It&#x27;s anyone&#x27;s guess how long these mind games will go on for. But this much is clear, it&#x27;s an intense battle!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="5-the-wisdom-of-weaklings-and-its-dangers"></a>5: The Wisdom of Weaklings, and Its Dangers<a class="hash-link" href="#5-the-wisdom-of-weaklings-and-its-dangers" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Kozue:</strong> Up until now we&#x27;ve only been reporting on the event, but we&#x27;ve decided it would be a waste if we didn&#x27;t participate too!<br>
<strong>Kozue:</strong> Which means we&#x27;ll be continuing our coverage of the event as we leave the chapel and try to find a bouquet of our own!<br>
<strong>Hina:</strong> Well actually, we already found one!<br>
<strong>Niwa Tomomu:</strong> Shhh! If you tell them that, you&#x27;re putting a big target on our backs! Just leave that part out!<br>
<strong>Kozue:</strong> Exactly! We were lucky enough to find this bouquet, so we don&#x27;t need any rivals coming after us.<br>
<strong>Kagami Mimi:</strong> It&#x27;s okay! Mimi will protect you!<br>
<strong>Tomomu:</strong> Having a toji around is so handy! The rest of us non-combatants are counting on you!<br>
<strong>Mimi:</strong> Ahh... Sorry, I said that, but I&#x27;ve actually never fought outside of play fighting... I&#x27;m not really used to my okatana yet...<br>
<strong>Tomomu:</strong> Don&#x27;t worry, you&#x27;re still the strongest one of us here for sure.<br>
<strong>Kozue:</strong> Anyway, let&#x27;s just keep an eye out as we head for the chapel altar.<br>
<strong>Hina:</strong> And once we make it to the altar, we&#x27;ll settle this with a no hard feelings rock-paper-scissors match! Until then, we&#x27;re all in this together!<br>
<strong>Mimi:</strong> Yeah!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Bouquet spotted-!<br>
<strong>Kozue:</strong> Gehh! It&#x27;s the fourth seat of the elite guard, Tsubakuro Yume-san!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I might be fourth seat, but I&#x27;m still the strongest!<br>
<strong>Mimi:</strong> E-Elite guard!? There&#x27;s no way I can beat her...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Hmm, so you get it already. That&#x27;s right, there&#x27;s nobody who can beat me, so hurry up and give me that bouquet!<br>
<strong>Kozue:</strong> U-Umm, is there any chance you&#x27;d be willing to overlook this...?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh~, but I finally found a bouquet?<br>
<strong>Hina:</strong> W-We&#x27;ll make it worth your while, of course-! If you leave us alone, I&#x27;ll buy you candy for a whole week!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> You will, onee-san?<br>
<strong>Hina:</strong> And if you act now, I&#x27;ll throw in a free set of 5 chocolate bars! What great value!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Candy and chocolate, huh...<br>
<strong>Kozue:</strong> With how strong you are, it would be way too easy to take it from us, wouldn&#x27;t it?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> That&#x27;s for sure! If I even got a little serious, this&#x27;d be over before you know it~!<br>
<strong>Hina:</strong> Yeah, of course. Of course you would. So I&#x27;ll even throw in a discount for you at the sword mountings specialty shop, &quot;Aoto-kan&quot;! ...Will you let us go?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Hmmm<del></del><del></del><br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Actually I won&#x27;t! I&#x27;m competing against Maki onee-san, after all. So I&#x27;m taking that bouquet from you.<br>
<strong>Kozue:</strong> W-We&#x27;re done for!<br>
<strong>Mimi:</strong> I-I won&#x27;t let you!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Oh, you&#x27;re actually gonna put up a fight?<br>
<strong>Mimi:</strong> You might be a really strong prodigy, Yume-san, and I might not be able to beat you...<br>
<strong>Mimi:</strong> But just because I can&#x27;t beat someone doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;m gonna run away. I&#x27;m still a toji, you know!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Nice, nice. That&#x27;s cool of you. But--<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> No matter how much you pump yourself up, what wasn&#x27;t gonna happen is still not gonna happen. A fight&#x27;s still a fight after all.<br>
<strong>Mimi:</strong> No way... I didn&#x27;t even see it-- Uuu... I&#x27;m the same age as you too...<br>
<strong>Tomomu:</strong> S-She&#x27;s too strong...<br>

<strong>Suzuka:</strong> If you keep your brow furrowed like that, those wrinkles really will turn you into an old lady, you know?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> No they won&#x27;t.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Of course not. Maki-san is a sweet young girl, after all.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Just let it go. I thought we moved on from that conversation.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Then tell me what&#x27;s the matter. Are you unhappy with this event?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I&#x27;m not unhappy with it. Whatever the mission requires, I&#x27;ll see it through. I&#x27;ll do it like I&#x27;ve always done.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> But, I just don&#x27;t understand.  Was this really something the elite guard needed to get involved with?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Well, it has a connection to politics.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Ahh... So that&#x27;s how it is.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yes. Thinking along those lines, involving the elite guard will carry quite a lot of influence in political circles.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> The ones supplying us with funding will feel satisfied seeing it put to good use.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> And even more so by seeing us front and center in the activities.<br>

<strong>Suzuka:</strong> If we&#x27;re to act as pandas, then we should put on the flashiest performance we can manage. ...This is all to give us better standing in negotiating a higher budget.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> In that case, you deserve this bouquet more than me. You should be the one to wear the wedding dress. I&#x27;m not cut out for it, but I&#x27;m sure it would look perfect on you, Suzuka.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> M-Maki-san...!? ...Fufu.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Hey, what&#x27;re you laughing at...! I&#x27;ve known from the start that I&#x27;d look no good in a dress.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Fufu. True. Rather than a dress, you&#x27;d look more natural in a tuxedo than anyone else, Maki-san.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...Though, you worked so hard for this bouquet. Are you sure you&#x27;re willing to give it to me? Wouldn&#x27;t that mean losing your competition with Yume?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Yume&#x27;s the one who came up with that competition. I never cared if I won or lost.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ...Now that that&#x27;s decided, let&#x27;s go. I&#x27;ll escort you to the chapel altar, Suzuka.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> You&#x27;ll escort me...? You say that like we&#x27;re actually getting married, Maki-san.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I couldn&#x27;t help myself, that&#x27;s all. Come on, let&#x27;s go to the chapel.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> It would be my utmost pleasure to be escorted by you, Maki-san. Now, let&#x27;s go. Fufufu!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="7-the-bride-battle-reaches-an-intense-impasse"></a>7: The Bride Battle Reaches an Intense Impasse<a class="hash-link" href="#7-the-bride-battle-reaches-an-intense-impasse" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Hina:</strong> --Bringing things up to speed, we gave up on getting bouquets and came back to the studio here in the chapel to focus on reporting the situation~.<br>
<strong>Kozue:</strong> In these final minutes, a fierce struggle is breaking out...<br>
<strong>Kozue:</strong> Whoa there! Now this is unexpected!<br>
<strong>Kozue:</strong> The ones who failed to get a bouquet of their own have gathered here at the chapel, waiting in a last ditch effort to steal from anyone who arrives with one!<br>
<strong>Kozue:</strong> With all of them crowded in here like this, it&#x27;s like an impassable human wall! Even a mouse couldn&#x27;t find a gap to slip through!<br>
<strong>Hina:</strong> Thanks to that, with only 5 minutes to go, not a single person&#x27;s made it to the goal yet. Forget closing with a bang, at this rate, the event will end in a whimper!<br>
<strong>Hina:</strong> Somebody~, anybody, just make it to the goal! If none of you put on a wedding dress, this&#x27;ll be a PR nightmare!<br>
<strong>Toji A:</strong> Hey, get out of my way!<br>
<strong>Toji B:</strong> If you want to get through, then hand over that bouquet!<br>
<strong>Toji C:</strong> Hey, stop pushing!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Whoa, look at all of them! Nn~, what should I dooo...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Don&#x27;t even think about it, Yume. If you went and did something unnecessary, people would get injured. They&#x27;re not strong enough for you, so just let it go today.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Hehehe~ You know me too well, Maki onee-san!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> But with no one able to reach the goal, this is quite a dilemma...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> We can&#x27;t get anywhere like this.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Don&#x27;t let your guard down here either, or else someone will steal our bouquets. We have to stay careful!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> We made it this far, so we have to reach the goal!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Sure we will. I&#x27;m not gonna let it end like this after all!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Still, what do you plan on doing? It doesn&#x27;t seem we can even leap over them.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> It&#x27;s okay if it ends like this.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> No way! They put the goal there so people would reach it!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> So what will you do?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I&#x27;ll, uhhh~... What do we do, Kanami?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Eh? What should we do, Hiyori-chan?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> As if I know.<br>
<strong>???:</strong> What&#x27;s going on here. Why has no one reached the goal?<br>
<strong>Kozue:</strong> Ahhh! Th-That voice; it can&#x27;t be! Ehhhhhhh!!!!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="8-the-head-of-the-family-has-arrived"></a>8: The Head of the Family has Arrived!<a class="hash-link" href="#8-the-head-of-the-family-has-arrived" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Yukari:</strong> What&#x27;s going on here. Why has no one reached the goal?<br>
<strong>Kozue:</strong> T-Th-The head of the familyyyy!?<br>
<strong>Hina:</strong> What&#x27;s Yukari-sama doing here!?<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> This event was organized for the Five Traditions... For the recognition of toji to be further spread among the people. Is it really so strange I would come to observe it?<br>
<strong>Kozue:</strong> Y-You have a point!<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> So then, why has no one reached the goal?<br>
<strong>Kozue:</strong> W-Well that&#x27;s because, umm... You see...<br>
<strong>Hina:</strong> R-Right...<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Why has no one reached the goal?<br>
<strong>Kozue:</strong> U-Uhh, well... Ahh! Oh no, time just ran ouuu<del>~t!! We&#x27;ve reached the time limit!<br><strong>Kozue:</strong> Who could have seen this coming; we finished without a single winner!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> ...Hm, that would be a problem. Then all the trouble of planning this event was for nothing.<br><strong>Hina:</strong> Y-Yes... It seems like it...<br><strong>Kozue:</strong> A-All of you gathered here</del>! If things end like this with no winners, you&#x27;re causing serious problems for the head of the family, you know!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ......Hmm~. Then, why doesn&#x27;t everyone reach the goal together? That way we can all wear dresses and everyone&#x27;s happy?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah, that could work!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Really...?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm. I think everyone should get along today.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> ...I see.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yes, it&#x27;s not such a bad idea. It can appeal to the unity of the Five Traditions as well.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh~, so that means everybody wins? But that&#x27;s boring.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Yume, you&#x27;re the only one who was hoping for this to become a bigger ordeal.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> In that case, I&#x27;ll allow for everyone here to be recognized as a winner.<br>
<strong>Kozue:</strong> R-Right! Understood! Then, everybody, head for the goal!<br>
<strong>Hina:</strong> Everybody, please start trying on dresses! And try to get along~! There&#x27;s dressing rooms ready for you here in the chapel~!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Everybody here&#x27;s a winner, huh! Ahaha! Just look at all their bright smiles!
