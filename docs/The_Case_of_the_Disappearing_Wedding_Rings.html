Someone's getting married again today~. It's June Bride season, after all.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> My mission's taken care of, so I think I'll make a quick little detour and check out the cute new bride in her dress-!<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> Keeeeee...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Ehh, what's an aradama doing here!?<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> Keeeee...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Wha-, it's headed for the wedding chapel! Stop-!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Getting married is the big moment every cute girl dreams of! I won't let you get anywhere near the ceremony! Take thiiis!<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> Keeee...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Phew, I managed to stop it~. The noro's taken care of, so I'll just head on over to see the bride... Huh?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Someone dropped a ring... And there's a huge diamond in it too. It must be expensive. This has gotta be an engagement ring. But, that's weird. It wasn't here before.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Ah-, what if it came out of the aradama I just exorcised...<br><strong>Police:</strong> You there, don't move, this is the police!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> The police!? Wh-What are you grabbing my arm for!? Let go of me, please-!<br><strong>Chapel Staff:</strong> Yes, officer, that's the girl! She's been here every day lately, acting suspicious outside the building, and, whenever the staff make eye contact with her, she runs off!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> S-Suspicious!?<br><strong>Police:</strong> Do you mind coming with us down to the station? There's some things we'd like to ask you as a potential suspect.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> E-Ehhhh~!? Why me!? You've got the wrong girl~!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Something awful happened! It's Yui-chan, she...<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> What's the matter, Musumi-san? You're all out of breath. What did Yamashiro-san do now?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I heard that, Yui-chan got taken away by the police.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Oh my god! So Yuiyui finally got arrested, huh~. Did they catch her peeping, or what~?  
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> This is serious! You've heard about it too, right? How rings keep getting stolen from the wedding chapel.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I saw them talking about it on the morning news. It's the chapel right by the school, isn't it?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Apparently the police suspected her of being the culprit behind the thefts, and that's why they took her away~.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Unbelievable! Yuiyui would never be a thief!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> That's right. If she were arrested for stalking that would be one thing, but I find it hard to believe she would steal rings.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I know Yui-chan would never do something like that! So, will you all help me out? We can prove Yui-chan didn't do it together.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Of course I will! But, what we could possibly do to prove Yuiyui's innocence... Hmmm.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> We can track down the stolen rings! That should prove Yui-chan wasn't the one who stole them, right?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> That makes sense. The thefts seem to occur every day, so if we lie in wait at the scene of the crime, we can catch the true culprit and recover the stolen rings.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> There's no time like the present! If we want to prove Yuiyui's innocence, we should head to the wedding chapel right away!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> This is it, the wedding chapel where the rings are getting stolen.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I received permission from the staff. We should split up to look for whether the rings could have fallen and gotten lost somewhere, and whether any suspicious individuals arrive.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Roger! I'll go look out in the courtyard.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I'll go check out the bride's waiting room!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Hmmm, it doesn't seem like any rings have gotten lost around here.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> There isn't anyone suspicious around either.<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> KEEEEEEEE!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> KYAAA----!! Why is there an aradama here!?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Please calm down, Musumi-san. This is a perfect opportunity to test the qualities of this new aradama which has appeared in the wedding chapel. Leave it to me.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> TAAAAAAA!<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> KEEEEEEE...<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Hm? Something came out from inside the defeated aradama.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ehhh!? Isn't that... That's a wedding ring!?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Since it popped out when you exorcised that aradama... That means, the culprit behind the stolen rings were aradama all along!?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Aradama were stealing the rings!? I've never heard of anything like that though. Tsugumi-san, do you know about this?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> This is the first case I've seen, so I'm just as surprised as you are. But, since we all witnessed it, there can be no doubt. Yamashiro-san must be innocent.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Thank goodness~. Still, I won't forgive them for stealing those rings from the brides!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> That's the spirit. For the brides, and to prove Yuiyui's innocence, we need to suppress every last aradama here!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Right! Let's all work together to stop those ring stealing aradama!  </p><h2 id="2-the-elite-guard-joins-in" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>2: The Elite Guard Joins In!</h2><p><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Come along, Maki-san, we have another mission to get to!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> You sure are eager today, Suzuka. I want to do all I can to clear the suspicions against Yamashiro Yui too.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Th-That's right! I'll give my utmost efforts to carry out this assignment, as I always do!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Like always~? But, ever since you heard about this mission at a wedding chapel, you've had a sorta smile on your face, Suzuka-onee-san.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> That's because... It's not as if I'm delighted to go with Maki-san to a wedding chapel, you know...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ahhh~, you said it all yourself! Still, I'm jealous. It must be fun, since there's supposed to be a lot of pretty brides around in June, right?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Tsubakuro-san, Shidou-san and Konohana-san are not going there to enjoy themselves.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I know that-. They're going to catch whoever's stealing rings from the brides, right? But, why do the elite guards have to catch a thief anyway?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Because the one responsible for the stolen rings is an aradama.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh~, there's an aradama ring thief!?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Strictly speaking, it's still an unconfirmed report. Yamashiro Yui, who was present at the scene, gave her testimony that the ring came out of an aradama the moment it was exorcised.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> It didn't seem as if she was lying... Though, as there were no other witnesses at the time, Yamashiro-san was placed under arrest.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Maki-san and I are going to the wedding chapel, on behalf of a request from the police, in order to determine the truth of the situation. Now, Maki-san, are you ready to go?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Hm? Yukari-sama is calling me. Yes, this is Shidou... Understood. I'll be there right away.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> What did she say?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> It's an urgent summons from Yukari-sama. Sorry, Yomi, but you'll have to go with Suzuka to the wedding chapel in my place.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Suzuka-onee-san, cheer up!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I do not need cheering up! Come now, Yomi-san, let's head to the scene.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> It's Hanahana and Yomiyomi! What brings you here?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Oh my, I see you're all here. We received a request for assistance from the police and came at once.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Our mission here is to determine whether the one stealing the rings is an aradama or Yamashiro-san.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> In that case, please look at this! It's proof that Yui-chan wasn't the culprit.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> This is, one of the stolen rings? Where on earth did you find it?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> After exorcising an aradama, this came out. All of us here observed it with our own eyes, so I can vouch that it's reliable information.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Hanahana, Yomiyomi, you have to take our testimony to the police and set Yuiyui free!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I truly wish I could do that, however...<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Unfortunately, the police will not be convinced by eyewitness reports from friends of the suspect. That's what we were dispatched here for.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Then, that means, unless an aradama shows up right in front of you, you won't set Yuiyui free!?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Please~. We don't know when another aradama could be here... And if you two aren't there to see it, who knows what will happen to Yui-chan?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> We will be monitoring the area to the best of our abilities. Sadly, we have no way of knowing when an aradama may appear...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Isn't there any other way we can help Yui-chan? I just know she's not the kind of girl who would ever steal a ring!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> She may be the kind of girl who would steal a classmate's gym uniform... But never something so valuable.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> That's right. She has been caught trying to secretly photograph everyone while they were changing, but Yuiyui would never steal a ring!<br><strong>Kiyoka/Tsugumi/Ellen:</strong> She's completely innocent!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> From your passionate assertions, I'm well aware that Yamashiro-san is a dangerous person, but not the type who would purposefully steal a ring.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> However, it is impossible for us to declare Yamashiro-san innocent unless we catch the culprit in the act.<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> KEEEEEEE!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ahhh-!? It's here! The aradama is here!!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> It's pretty rare to feel this glad to see an aradama.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Konohana-san, Satsuki-san, we will show you all the evidence you need now. Please watch closely.  </p><h2 id="3-a-touching-reunion" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>3: A Touching Reunion!?</h2><p><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Konohana-san! Satsuki-san! You saw what happened now, didn't you? When the wedding ring came shooting out of the aradama!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yes, I certainly witnessed it.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Aradama that collect wedding rings. Having seen it a second time, the data becomes all that more credible. As soon as I get back to the lab with this, I can...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Tsugumi-san, please wait! We have to help Yui-chan first.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I'm sorry, I almost forgot our main objective... Though, with this many eyewitnesses, this should be irrefutable evidence.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> We should go right to the police station, so we can ask them to free Yuiyui!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> We will also be sure to explain the details of the situation to the police representative who asked for the Origami family's involvement.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Go on, leave the rest of the work to us and go pay Yamashiro-san a visit.<br><strong>Kiyoka/Tsugumi/Ellen:</strong> Okay!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Yui-chan! We all came here to prove your innocence!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> It must have been so hard for you, Yuiyui, in this unfamiliar place... You look so worn down... Or not?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> That's true. Is it me, or does the complexion of her skin look healthy, and she even seems to be more excited than usual...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Thank you for coming all the way here to see me!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> I was actually hoping we could have a tearful reunion through a plexiglass window, and maybe share a kiss through it, but they just let you meet suspects face to face in here. It kinda spoils the mood, huh~.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Yui-chan... Somehow, it seems like you're doing just fine.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> More than fine, is it my imagination, or is she enjoying being here?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Ah-! Don't tell me, they put you through such horrible torture that your mind went crazy?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Ahaha, it's nothing like that~. Sure, when I was caught by the police, I was thinking, "What do I do!? My life's over~!"<br><strong>Yui:</strong> But then in the police car, this cute police lady was snuggled up right next to me. Then I got to go into a private room and talk to this sexy detective lady all alone; it was actually a lot more fun than I was expecting.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> A reaction that defies all expectations... That's Yamashiro-san for you.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I can't believe you-! I was so worried, to the point I couldn't even eat, you know?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> You were that worried about me... I'm really feeling loved here~.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Actually, Kiyoka might be a little haggard, but you're looking kind of healthy yourself, Yuiyui...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Ahaha, you think so too, Ellen-san? Well, when I was in the interview room, they gave me a whole lot of katsudon, so I might've put on a little weight~.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> You really are enjoying your time here to the fullest, weren't you...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I was worried sick about you-! You're terrible, Yui-chan! I don't care what happens to you anymore!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Wait, wait! Don't go, Kiyoka-chan! I mean, they gave me as many katsudons as I asked for, okay? Anyone would eat as much as they can if you give them a free all you can eat buffet, right?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Yamashiro-san, I don't think you're aware of this, but the katsudon you ate in the interview room wasn't the detective treating you to a meal.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Eh-!? She wasn't!?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I've heard that, when you're released, they give you a bill for for everything all at once.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> No way... Why wouldn't they tell me something like that from the beginning-!?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> If they won't give me all the katsudon I can eat, then I've got no reason to be sitting around here! Please help me leave this place~!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I'm not so sure anymore, if the only reason you want to leave is because you won't get free katsudon...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Come on, of course I have more reasons than that. If somebody doesn't stop those ring stealing aradama, then there'll be no end to the brides getting their hearts broken. I've gotta do what I can to help!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Yui-chan... That's right, we have to get you out of here and do all we can to suppress the aradama!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Hanahana and Yomiyomi from the elite guard are working to prove the culprit behind this is an aradama. We just have to be a little patient.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Ehh-!? Konohana-san and Yomi-san are going out of their way for me!?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> What should I do~. I think my heart skipped a beat! I found yet another reason to be happy I got arrested!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Sigh... Nothing can keep Yui-chan down, can it...<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> She's a real testament to humanity's ability to thrive under any circumstances.  </p><h2 id="4-suzuka-and-yomis-acquittal-plan" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>4: Suzuka and Yomi's Acquittal Plan</h2><p><strong>Yomi:</strong> They said they couldn't release Yamashiro-san... I wonder why that is?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Do the police mean to say they cannot trust our word?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Suzuka-onee-san, calm down. There's a reaaally~ good reason for this. Right, Maki-onee-san!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Yeah, that's right. If I had to say either way, they have pretty solid reasoning for not letting Yamashiro Yui go yet.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Why is it you two seem to be struggling not to laugh?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I can't imagine what Shidou-san and Tsubakuro-san are getting at...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I'm as lost as you are. You went to visit the police when we were on our mission, didn't you? What could have happened there?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Sorry about that. I should know better than to let my emotions show when working.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> The police accepted your report that the culprit was an aradama.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> In that case, why would they postpone her release?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> That onee-san, they said she might've done a whole lot of other bad things, so they can't let her go.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Other bad things? Does that mean that Yamashiro-san has committed other crimes?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> No, they can't decide if any of them were crimes, but there seems to be plenty of things that fall in a grey area.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> The police interviewed her friends, and found cases suchs as her relentlessly following after female students that caught her interest...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Or hanging around the girls' locker room with a camera...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Those are all things it sounds like Yamashiro-san would do...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> If nothing's too suspicious, they plan on trusting what you and the other toji said and letting her go, but...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I'm starting to understand. Just how significant one's usual habits can be for them.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I feel the same...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Though be that as it may, if Yamashiro-san is kept in the police station much longer, it would be troublesome for our work as toji, wouldn't it?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes. If she hasn't broken any laws, it would be reasonable to release her and have toji be on their guard around her.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> I agree with what you're saying. But, there's another problem.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> From the sound of things, the police already had their eye on her, after she'd been frequently visiting the wedding chapel.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> They said they caught her ooover and over again on the security cameras, peeking around the chapel with a weird grin on her face.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> That sounds like something Yamashiro-san would do as well... However, knowing her, she was surely only wanting to get a look at the beautiful brides, wasn't she?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Frequently visiting the chapel to see women dressed up for the occasion... Anyone familiar with Yamashiro-san would quickly accept that explanation.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> If only someone at the police station knew about her, this could all go smoothly...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...Sigh. It seems this can't be settled so simply.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Onee-sans, you're just overthinking this. All we've gotta do is get rid of every aradama that stole rings, then give all the rings back, and then they'll let her go, right?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I see, that would work as well. If that's what it comes to, we should eliminate all the aradama who have appeared at the wedding chapel, and recover their rings as quickly as we can.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Unfortunately, Yume and I have already been tasked with another assignment. I'm leaving this to you, Suzuka, Yomi.<br><strong>Suzuka/Yomi:</strong> Of course.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Well now, all of you are here as well?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> The wedding chapel's staff agreed to let us stay here so we could ambush the aradama when they appear.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> After all, the best way to prove Yuiyui's innocence is to suppress the aradama and get back all the rings.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> We came to the same conclusion. We'll give you our support.<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> KEEEEEEE!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Wow! One's here already.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Everyone, let's give it our best efforts!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Right! I'll do my best, so Yui can get released!  </p><h2 id="5-finally-free" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>5: Finally Free!</h2><p><strong>Yui:</strong> Ahh~! The air on the outside really does taste better~.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Honestly! We went through a lot of troublew proving your innocence, Yui-chan. You'd better thank everyone from the elite guard too.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Sure I will! Whether it's my heart or my body, I'll give them anything they want from me.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> There's no need for you to feel that grateful.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes, I have to respectfully decline as well.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Come onnn~!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> And on that note, everything's taken care of! Or, I wish it were that easy, but...<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> We have a bit of bad news for you all. News has just come in that there are still some rings which haven't been recovered from the aradama.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Ehh-!? That wasn't all of them!?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> We finished our biggest goal by getting Yui released, but thinking about the poor brides, there's no way we can stop here.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> We've come this far together, so the two of us will continue to offer our assistance.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Great! In that case, let's all head back to the wedding chapel!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Wait? There's no brides in the reception hall today, are there?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Word got out about the aradama always showing up here, so people kept cancelling their plans. If we don't deal with the aradama quick, the wedding chapel will go out of business...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Gehh-! We can't let that happen! We have to take out every last aradama, so this oasis of my heart can stay afloat!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Kanamin went and talked to the people at the chapel for us, so we can lie in wait for the aradama in the reception hall!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Understood. ...What's this? One of the programs for a wedding reception was left on the floor.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Program? What's that?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> It's a sort of schedule for events like wedding ceremonies or receptions that list how things are meant to progress and the performances.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> "Cutting the cake, the first bite, slideshow down memory lane, something to entertain all our friends, letters to our parents..." It all sounds like a lot of fun!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Japanese wedding ceremonies sound like they go all out!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It's exciting just reading the program. I can't help but picture the wonderful wedding ceremony I might have someday!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> You're such a pure little maiden after all, Kiyoka-chan. When I get rich, I'll make your dreams come true and give you the grandest wedding you can imagine!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> And Yamashiro-san seems to have fully assumed the position of the groom...<br><strong>Yui:</strong>　Ah-, but I'm not just talking about Kiyoka-chan. I want you all to be there as brides, so we can have a reception with everyone in wedding dresses!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Wow! A wedding reception packed to the brim with toji! Sounds like fun! I bet it'd be exciting to use our okatana to cut the cake, huh~.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Cutting the cake with an okatana. Maki-san, doing it in a pure white tuxedo, would be simply divine... Ahh...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Hm? What's wrong, Hanahana? Your face started turning red?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I-It's nothing at all!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You know, I'd like to see Shidou-san cutting the cake too! And with Konohana-san standing next to her in a dress, I'm sure it would make for a beautiful photo!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> D-Did you overhear that? Musumi-san... You have it all wrong, I-I was only...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Mmm~, Suzuka-san is just the best when she's blushing too~. This is why I can't get enough of working together with the elite guard!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> What do you want to do at the wedding reception, Satsuki-san?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Nothing comes to mind... I'm not very good with social events.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Don't say that, here, just look at the program! Doesn't seeing such a fun filled event put you in a good mood?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> (Stare)... I'm sorry, I don't see any events that stand out to me... Hm? Yamashiro-san, what is this "rice shower" about...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> To celebrate the wedding, everyone pours rice over the bride like a shower. It's so pretty, like fresh snow coming down~.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> They pour rice at a wedding ceremony? Why would they do that...<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Rice symbolizes prosperity and bearing many descendants, so it came to be seen as being showered with good fortune.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I see. It's true that, from one grain you can produce hundreds or thousands more, so rice is the most suitable symbol to use with wishing for prosperity and fertility.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> On top of that, there is a legend that seven gods reside within a single grain of rice. They are strongly believed to be the Seven Gods of Fortune, so it could be said that rice is a necessity at any celebration...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Y-Yomiyomi!?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> And also, along with gold, silver, and jewels, the treasure ship the Seven Gods of Fortune ride on carries bags of rice to represent an abundant harvest. Stacks of rice are considered a good luck charm that bring peace to a family and financial success...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I didn't think Satsuki-san could talk this much...<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> KEEEEEEE!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Ah-, aradama. Everyone, this isn't the time for needless conversation. Let's carry out our mission at once.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Needless conversation... You were the one doing most of the talking though, Satsuki-san.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> We could all do shift our focus as quickly as Yomi... Let's follow by example and join her!  </p><h2 id="6-a-surprise-thank-you-and-apology" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>6: A Surprise Thank You and Apology</h2><p><strong>Yui:</strong> Alrighty-! Now all the stolen rings have really for real been found again!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Mission accomplished. With that, we will withdraw. Good work, the rest of you.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> We should probably get going too. Kanamin and them were really into the idea of throwing Yuiyui a welcome back party.<br><strong>Chapel Manager:</strong> Please, wait!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Yui-chan, that's the person in charge of this whole wedding chapel... I wonder why he came running out here in such a hurry.<br><strong>Chapel Manager:</strong> Thank you so much for getting all those rings back. And also, I'm terribly sorry for being so suspicious of you!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Mr. Manager, you don't have to bow your head. It was my fault too, for sneaking into the wedding chapel all those times. You shouldn't blame yourself.<br><strong>Chapel Manager:</strong> Even if you say that... Please, let me do something to make it up to you.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> It's okay, you don't need to make it up to me. All I needed was to bring the smiles back to the faces of those teary eyed brides.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> It was also a part of our work as toji, so there really is no need to worry about us.<br><strong>Chapel Manager:</strong> Still, after all the trouble I caused you, if I don't do something to apologize, I won't be able to feel this is settled! Please, is there any way I can repay you!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> If you insist so much, we could hardly outright refuse you. Yamashiro-san, can you not think of any requests?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Ah-! I thought of something good. Mr. Manager, let me borrow your ear for a second.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> (Whisper whisper)... Would something like that work?<br><strong>Chapel Manager:</strong> It would be my pleasure! I will have enough ready for everyone as soon as I can.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Hooray-!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Yui-chan, what did you ask for?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Mfufu, you'll just have to wait and see~.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Look at all these stunningly beautiful wedding dresses...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I don't believe it-! This dress is the latest design from a famous designer! Yui-chan, what's it doing here?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> The manager prepared all these after I said I wanted everyone to wear a wedding dress. Go ahead and pick out the dresses you like the most!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> They're all so gorgeous; I can't make up my mind!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yes, they're all exquisite, aren't they. If only Maki-san had come along...<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I will now be returning to the Origami estate, so I can send Shidou-san here in my place.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> You can't go now, Yomi-san! We made sure to get enough for each of you, so please, you have to wear one!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yamashiro-san has the right idea. If they offer their gratitude, it is our duty to accept it. There's no need to concern yourself with Maki-san; I'll be sure to involve her with the next amusing distraction we find.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> If you say it's our duty... I have no choice but to accept.<br><strong>Chapel Manager:</strong> Regrettably, the dressing room is filled at the moment, so I must ask you to please change here in the chapel. As this is the top floor, I can assure you that no one will see inside.<br><strong>Everyone:</strong> Okaaay!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I'm going with this dress! Ahh, it's just fantastic. If I'd known a chance like this would come along, I would have gone on a diet~.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I think you're plenty cute as you are, Kiyoka. I'll be wearing this dress here!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I'd like a long sleeved dress with little skin exposed, if possible... Hm? Speaking of which, I haven't seen Yamashiro-san for some time now.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I can still feel her eyes watching though... Ah-, over there! That suspicious figure on the rooftop across the way!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Even from this far, I can recognize that silhouette. That would be Yamashiro-san, with a telescopic camera readied.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> A telescopic camera!?  Was she planning to secretly photograph us from long range!?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> This is an emergency, everyone! Please stop changing for no...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Hang on a minute! It looks like Yui-chan is being apprehended by security officers...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Right after we helped her get out, she's getting arrested again!?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Unbelievable... There's just no keeping up with Yamashiro-san, is there.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> E-EHHHH~!? Wait, please let go of me-!

I'll wear a wedding dress and lure it out, so you just have to watch me, Yomi-onee-san!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ...Is there a dress available for us to use?<br><strong>Chapel Staff:</strong> Ah, yes, of course. I'll have one for you right away.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> A wedding dress~! I can't wait~!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> So this is the reason you proposed an undercover search.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Very well. Then, please leave the aradama to me.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Why!?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> It's possible the aradama may not appear if you are holding an okatana.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> The decoy should focus entirely on luring out the aradama. The guard will take care of the rest.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I don't want to wear a wedding dress then! You wear it, Yomi-onee-san!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Weren't you looking forward to wearing it?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I was, but... If I don't fight, then I can't show off my good side.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ...Understood.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> We will switch off acting as the decoy, so I will have a wedding dress prepared for me as well.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Hey hey? Is it okay if I take a picture of you wearing your dress, Yomi-onee-san?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ...What would you need that for?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> To remember the occasion! We might not get to do this again, so I want to show everyone!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ...Eh? Everyone...?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Maki-onee-san and Suzuka-onee-san and Yukari-sama!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Th-That would be...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> No backing out-! We're doing it for sure-! Ahaha, I can't wait-!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> For... sure?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Yeah!  </p><h2 id="bride-yomi-end-please-dont-look" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Bride Yomi: End]: Please Don't Look</h2><p><strong>Yume:</strong> Is she ready yet-, is Yomi-onee-san ready yet-?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ...Sorry for taking so long.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ah, I've been waiting forever, Yomi-on--<br><strong>Yume:</strong> ...Wow!

You're like a real bride!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ...Th-Thank you very much. Hopefully the aradama thinks I am a real bride too...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> What do you want to do until the aradama shows up? Should we walk around?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> First, we should wait here.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> If it doesn't come... Then we can walk around a little.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Hey hey, while we wait for the aradama, I can take some pictures, right?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ...Please don't point your phone at me.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> There's no way I'm passing up something this fun.

HAAAA!!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Huh, that was nothing.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ...Tsubakuro-san, you weren't supposed to defeat it. Now we can't identify where the stolen ring was taken.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> The heck, that sounds annoying.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> We have no choice but to wait for another aradama to appear.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> You did well on your assignment. ...Yomi?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> That wedding dress suited you.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> H-How did you...
