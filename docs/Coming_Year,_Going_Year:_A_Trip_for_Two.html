Thank goodness! We made it to the train right on schedule.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Slow down, Mihono-chan! Honestly, if we missed this train, we could have just caught the next one. Why are you in such a rush?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> That's cause, I get to go on a big trip with Chii-nee, of course! There's a whole bunch of things I want to do, so I want to follow the schedule exactly.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah! That reminds me. These are our schedules for this trip. This one's for you, Chii-nee.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> You made these yourself!? They're thick too, aren't they...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ehehe. Once I started writing down all the places I wanted to see and the things I wanted to do, it started getting really long.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Fufu. Well, thank you for going to the trouble. And also, this schedule is so detailed, isn't it? You have what we'll be doing divided down to the minutes.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I thought we'd get through every one of my goals for the trip, so it ended up being tighter than I expected. But, when it's us two, where there's a will, there's a way! Right?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Well, if we go down the list, we might be able to manage it... But, don't you think it would be better to relax a bit more?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> We can't do that! Let's do all of it! Cause we came on this trip together!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> (? Mihono-chan's acting different than usual... I wonder what's gotten into her...)<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Hey, we can do all of it, right? That'll be fine, right, Chii-nee?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> O-Of course, so long as you're happy, Mihono-chan. It is our last trip of the year, after all.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> ...What's wrong? You're making such a sad face.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah-! It's nothing! Yeah, I'm just fine! It's all alright!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Are you sure? Then, if you say so...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Oh, I'm getting a call from school. What if it's about a mission... I'll just step out of the compartment for a minute while I take this.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> She left...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Oh? Hono-chan. What are you doing here? Are you going somewhere?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Kiyoka! And Iwakura-san too! You too; what are you doing here?<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> We're on our way to take care of an expedition assignment. Everyone else seems to already be on their New Year's break, but this is our last work day of the year.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> What about you, Hono-chan? You're already on your vacation, aren't you?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah! Chii-nee and me are using our New Year's break to go on a trip together, starting today. See, look at this! It's our trip guide. I made it myself, and I'm pretty proud of how it turned out!<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Wow, that's incredible! The schedule is packed tight too; it's just dripping with your excitement for the trip.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It sure is. I think it seems like a little much to do in just two days and one night though...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Well, that's because, Chii-nee's going to...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah! Nevermind that! It's nothing, so don't worry about it! Okay!<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Doesn't it seem like Asakura-san was hiding something just now?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It does. It's like Hono-chan's worried about something important on this trip...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ahh, while we were chatting, we arrived at our stop. Anyway, Hono-chan, have fun on your trip, okay.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Thanks--! You two take care too!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Chii-nee sure is taking a while. I wonder if she's still on the phone...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Mihono-chan, sorry I took so long! I bought ice cream from the train. Let's have it together.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Awesome-! Thanks, Chii-nee! I'll dig right in...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Wait, huh!? The ice cream's so frozen my spoon won't go in!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Fufu, you're right. It's a frozen as ice. We'll have to warm it up so it gets softer.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> ~~! So cold!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> !? Mihono-chan? You didn't have to take a picture now...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> But, isn't getting to see you warming up ice cream with your hands the kind of thing you'd see on a trip?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Honestly... Then, at least take it with the both of us. Just set it on a timer, and...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Oh, the ice cream's melting! Mihono-chan, here you go.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Thanks! Ahhm!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Look, look, Chii-nee! It took the picture right when we were taking abite!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Wow, it sure did! You can see the scenery out the window too. We've only just started and already we've gotten a wonderful photo of our trip.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah! Let's keep this up and make a whole bunch of memories here!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Sure!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> ...Ah! It looks like we're here at the station. Mihono-chan, be sure you don't forget anything, okay?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Here we are! In the guidebook, it says the locals welcome tourists here with singing and dancing, but...<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> Guooooo...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Aradama! For them to be here of all places.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> And our trip's barely even started! We have to get rid of them quick, so we can make a bunch of memories like we planned on!  </p><h2 id="2-its-hard-sticking-to-the-schedule" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>2: It's Hard Sticking to the Schedule!?</h2><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> Phew, we beat the aradama, so let's get our trip back on track!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> First, we need to try the limited offer mitarashi dango they sell at the station...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Oh no; they're all sold out for today!?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Eh-!? But...<br><strong>Shopkeeper:</strong> Sorry about that, we just sold out. If you'd been here five minutes sooner...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Uuu... Just five minutes... If only those aradama weren't here...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> There's nothing we can do about it. Even if we are off duty, it's still a toji's responsibility to suppress aradama.<br><strong>Shopkeeper:</strong> Oh, you two were dealing with some aradama? Then, as thanks, take this. It's fresh bread from a local bakery.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Whoaa~, it smells great. And it's warm too; I bet it's yummy!<br><strong>Shopkeeper:</strong> About that bakery, they don't mention it in the guidebooks. It's a special little place only the locals know about. Here, eat it before it goes cold.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Thank you very much. Then, we'll take you up on that. Ohm...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Mm, it's delicious!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> It really is! This is good! It's nice and hot and fluffy; I feel like I could eat this forever!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Fufu, I'm glad to see you're cheering up now, Mihono-chan. Suppressing the aradama might have taken some of our time, but because of that, we found something nice we weren't expecting.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah, it's all because the locals were nice to us that we got to eat such good bread. This'll be a good memory too, won't it!<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Hm? We ran into each other again!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Kiyoka-chan, Sanae-chan! You two were on an expedition, weren't you? Did you finish that up already?<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Yes. We managed to take care of it sooner than expected, so I talked with Musumi-san about doing a little sightseeing before we went back.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> If you take the bus from in front of the station, you can get to a a lake with a power spot that's secretly famous.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> For real!? That wasn't in any of the guidebooks I read, but it sounds cool! Chii-nee, do you want to go check it out too?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Sure! Having a spur of the moment change of plans is part of the thrill of going on a trip. Let's go see!<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> If we're all going, then let's hurry over to the bus stop. The bus only comes twice per day, so we have to be careful not to miss it.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> This place is that rare, huh! I'm getting excited; it's like we're going exploring!<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> Guooooooo...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Eh-!? More aradama!? This time for sure, I won't let them ruin our trip!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Let's all fight our best, to get to that power spot!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Here I go! HAA!<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> TAAAAAAH!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Pant, pant... No matter how many we defeat, more are appearing... This might be too much for the four of us...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Uuu... We're running out of time doing this too-!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> We'll be backing you up!<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Shidou-senpai!?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> And Tsubakuro-san too!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Kyahaha. Looks like I'll be able to beat a whole ton of them here!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> EIII---!  </p><h2 id="3-on-a-big-fun-girls-tour-together" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>3: On a Big Fun Girls Tour Together!</h2><p><strong>Chie:</strong> With Shidou-san and Tsubakuro-san's help, we managed to clean them all out.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> But still, what brings you two here anyway?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> We were on our way back from an expedition, and just happened to be passing through. I'm glad we could lend a hand.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> It wasn't really enough to satisfy me though-. And hey, what are those onee-sans looking all sad for?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Uuu... The bus that only comes twice a day left already...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It's a shame, but I'll have to come see this power spot another time. Sigh...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Hey, you two. There's so many other things left for us to do, soit's a waste for you to be moping around now. Let's cheer up and move on to our next destination!<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Setouchi-san is right! There should be plenty of things left that we can do now. Like, if we leave from this neighborhood now, we can...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Nn? What's that? That big book with all those notes in it.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> It's the trip guidebook Asakura-san made. They were supposed to follow this and have a good time sightseeing, but then aradama appeared...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> I see. It must be frustrating having plans this detailed getting spoiled like that.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Let me see it too!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Hmm-! I didn't think there'd be this many neat sounding places this close by here.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Maki-onee-san, we should go see them too!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Unfortunately, I've got another mission to take care of, so I can't guide you around. We can do it some other time.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh-, but, after coming all the way out here, I wanna play around some-.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> In that case, would you like to join us, Tsubakuro-san?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Good idea! I wanna thank you for helping us out, and it's more fun with more people!<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Shidou-senpai, we'll take responsibility and make sure she gets home safe, so please don't worry and go on your mission.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Alright. If you insist, then I guess I'll leave her with you.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Yume, make sure you do what they tell you, okay?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Hooray-! Come on, onee-sans, let's go right now!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Wow, the stained glass is gorgeous. It was beautiful on the outside, but inside the building, there's such a lovely old fashioned feeling to it.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> A bunch of guidebooks said you just had to see the stained glass at this church!<br><strong>???:</strong> ~~<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Huh? I hear some pretty voices singing.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> It sounds like it's practice time for the choir. Getting to hear hymns being sung live in such a romantic place is a real luxury!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> We must be really lucky, showing up just in time for them to start practicing!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> That's for sure. Our plans were thrown off due to the aradama, but we got to experience something this nice thanks to it.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> So, next is a cake shop in a studio up in the mountains. Even though it's so far from town, there's so many customers here!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It seems popular enough that people will come far and wide to eat here. Hono-chan, we found a really nice shop!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ehehe, we sure did! Still, there's so many different kinds of cakes, and they all look so good, that it's tough making up your mind!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Fufu, in that case, how about we split ours with each other? That way you can have double the cakes.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Oh yeah! Nice idea! I'll have this strawberry shortcake then! I'll give you the part with the big strawberry, Chii-nee!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> You can have the chestnuts off the top of my Mont Blanc then, Mihono-chan.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Those onee-sans really get along, don't they.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> They sure do. Just watching them together makes me feel happier.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Phwah-! That tasted so good! Guys-, if you're done eating, next up is a horseriding experience at a farm close by!<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Even though we've been stopping by one place after another, there's still more to see? This really is a whirlwind tour.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Since we had the chance to go on this trip, I wanted to do as much as we can before the sun goes down!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I want to ride on the horsies too! Let's go there fast, onee-sans!<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> Guooooo...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Hey-! Why'd aradama have to come out now!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> We might've gotten to see a bunch of fun stuff because aradama messed up our schedule, but I still hate them getting in our way!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Agreed; let's make sure to defeat them now so they can't interrupt us any more!  </p><h2 id="4-enjoying-a-trip-to-the-hot-springs" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>4: Enjoying a Trip to the Hot Springs</h2><p><strong>Yume:</strong> Eh-, while we were busy beating the aradama, the sun went down!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Uuu... After the horseriding, we were supposed to do mandarin picking at an orange farm, and then there were a ton ton ton more things I wanted to do---!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Mihono-chan, cheer up. It's gotten cold now, so wouldn't it be fine if we just relax at the ryokan and pass the end of the year together?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Getting in some hot springs and taking your time in a nice yet unfamiliar room is part of enjoying a trip too, isn't it?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> You're right, that does sound fun too, but... Uuu...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Don't let it get you down, Hono-chan. We're going back now, but you two have a wonderful stay at a ryokan booked for you, don't you?<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> That's right; didn't you write in the guide all the things you wanted to do in your room together? I'm sure you'll still have lots of fun from here!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...You're right! This is no time for me to be down in the dumps!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Thanks to you onee-sans, I got to have a really fun New Year's Eve~. Have fun at the hot springs, okay?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Wow, this room is so pretty looking! Getting this whole big room just for me and Chii-nee is so deluxe-!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Isn't it? Let's take a short rest here, then go to the hot springs. It seems like they let you reserve open air baths too.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Whoa-! I'm getting excited for it now! And dinner will be waiting for us after we get out of the baths, so there's still lots of fun to have together!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ahh-, I ate my fill back there. The hot springs felt so good after eating too. I'm feeling nice~.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> So, uh, next on the schedule is... An end of the year card tournament with Chii-nee!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Fufu, you're just full of energy, aren't you.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Mihono-chan, the year isn't quite over yet, but thank you for spending it with me.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Chii-nee... Don't go saying it's over or anything!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Eh? Why not, Mihono-chan?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah... Nevermind, it's nothing. Sorry about that.  Now, where'd I put the cards...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> (What's come over Mihono-chan? That reminds me, there was a time on the train ride when she acted different from her usual self too.)<br><strong>Chie:</strong> (Maybe she was so excited for this that she couldn't sleep last night? If that's what it is, then I can't let her push herself too hard.)<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Mihono-chan, come lie here on this futon for a minute.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Eh? What's this for, Chii-nee?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> You must be tired from running around since this morning, right? I'll give you a massage.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ehh!? You will?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Fufu, of course I will. It's a show of my appreciation for all the fun places you took me to. Here, lie down.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> If you say so, then...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Ahh... That feels so good~.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Chii-nee, your hands are so waaarm.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Fufu, just lie back and relax.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Sure... Fuaahh... It's like my back is melting; it's too good~.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Haa~... That feels nice...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Fuah~... Nnn~... Zzz...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Oh, Mihono-chan? Fufu, she's sleeping now.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> ...Her face is so innocent when she's asleep. I wonder what she's dreaming about.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> [mumble mumble]... Chii-nee... We're going here next...! Chii-nee... Ngh...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Even in her dreams, she's still leading me around. Thank you very much for taking me on a pleasant journey, Mihono-chan.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Yawn~. Looking at how happily Mihono-chan's sleeping is making me feel drowsy too.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> It doesn't look like we'll be able to do a countdown to the new year, so I'll just lie down and we can sleep together.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> [sleep breathing]...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> [sleep mumbling]...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Nn...?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> WAHH------!!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (No way-! I fell asleep!?)<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (What do I do now; we might not make it for the most important part of this trip--!!)<br><div><iframe width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XL33MXyxw44?t=994"></iframe></div>  </p><h2 id="5-will-we-make-to-the-main-event" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>5: Will We Make to the Main Event!?</h2><p><strong>Chie:</strong> ......? Mihono-chan? What's the matter? It's still pitch dark outside...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Chii-nee, get up! If we don't get out there soon, the first sunrise'll happen!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> If you want to see the sunrise, we can do it from the window here, you know.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> There's someplace I want to go with you no matter what though! I want us to see the first sunrise from there-!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> (It's been on my mind ever since yesterday, but why is Mihono-chan acting so frantic? Does she have some special reason...?)<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Alright then. If you really want to go, let's go see the first sunrise together.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Uuu, I was prepared for this, but it's still freezing... Are you doing okay, Chii-nee? Sorry, for forcing you to come out in the cold with me.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> I'm just fine. But, look at you, your hands are all red. Here, why not use my gloves?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> If I did that, then your hands would get cold! I'll be fine! See, I'm doing great...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Achoo!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Honestly... You're pushing yourself so hard, Mihono-chan.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Here, we'll each wear one of my gloves. And then, we can hold each other's hands with the hand that doesn't have a glove on. Alright?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Whoa! Your hand is so warm, Chii-nee.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Fufu, that's better, isn't it? It's almost time for the sunrise, so let's keep going!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> It's getting brighter out. Are we almost to where we're going?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ahh, look down the path! The first sunrise is coming up!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Wow... You're right! It's beautiful...!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...I'm so glad we made it. I got to see the first sunrise with Chii-nee...!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Mmhm. I'm glad I got to see such a beautiful sunrise with you, Mihono-chan.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Thank you for bringing me along.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I'm really happy I got to see the first sunrise together with you too, Chii-nee.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> But...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> What's wrong, Mihono-chan?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Fighting with aradama took up our time, so we didn't get to do half the things I wanted to...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Oh, Mihono-chan... Don't you think there were too many things to do on your list in the first place? Why were you so desperate to do them all?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> That's because...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Since you're four grades higher, you're about to graduate before me, right? And, when you do, we might be split up again...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> So that's why, while we still have time together, I wanted to make as many memories as possible.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Mihono-chan...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Come here.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Wah, you're making me embarassed, rubbing my head out here like that-.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Fufu, what's wrong with it.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> You know, Mihono-chan. From now on, whatever path I take, the two of us will always be together. So don't worry.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> So, the places we didn't get to go on this trip, we can go see together the next time.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Chii-nee...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Fufu, thank goodness. You're smiling again, Mihono-chan.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> I know, let's make a wish on the first sunrise. A wish that we'll be able to peacefully spend another year together.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Good idea! After all we went through to see this sunrise, whatever we wish for is gonna get granted for sure!<br><strong>Mihono/Chie:</strong> This year, and the next year, and every year after that, please let us stay happily together!<br><div><iframe width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EgIu3T30SHE"></iframe></div>  </p><h2 id="casual-20---mihono-start-planning-a-new-years-trip" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Casual 20 - Mihono: Start]: Planning a New Year's Trip</h2><p>Several days before New Year's Eve.</p><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> I can't take the local gourmet off the list after all, can I. But, I wanted to put the petting zoo in too...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Huh, what are you doing all by yourself there, Mihono-chan?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yui, and Mirja-san too!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> That's quite a lot of guidebooks you have open. Are you going on a trip somewhere?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I'm planning on doing an overnight trip on New Year's Eve with Chii-nee... And, I was checking what sights we should go see!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Two girls, taking a trip into the new year together... Just those words alone are enough to make your heart throb. Maybe I'll tag along too...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Yamashiro Yui, that would be inconsiderate of you. And, if I recall, you have missions scheduled as far as New Year's Eve, don't you?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Ugh, you're right... I'm so jealous Mihono-chan and them get to take their New Year's break early-.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Hang in there, Yui. I'll be sure to get souvenirs to bring back for everyone.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Souvenirs are nice and all, but more than that, I want to see lovey dovey photos of you two on your trip!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Please, help me get through my missions on New Year's Eve! Send them to me as you go! I'll be waiting for them!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> O-Okay, sure. I'll send them when I remember to.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> If I can get some shots of two dreamy girls spending a heart-pounding New Year's tour together, I feel like I'll be able to pull through! You have to send them to me no matter what! It's a promise!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Okay, I'll do what I can, but, what kind of photos do you want anyway?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Let's see... How about, photos of the two of you feeding each other food you bought on the train, like, "Ahhn"!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> And then, photos of you staring deep into each others' eyes on the beach while you share your love, and photos of the two of you proposing in a romantic church deep in the mountains!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I can't help but feel your suggestions are leading towards something other than a normal tour for two girls...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Well, I was hoping to have something a little more exciting for us to do together, but do you have any ideas, Mirja-san?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> If you are planning a New Year's trip, a shrine visit and viewing the first sunrise would be standard suggestions.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> And, if time permits, it might be good to work in something slightly more original.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Something more original? Like what?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> For example, rather than simply viewing the first sunrise on New Year's day, why not admire the setting sun on New Year's Eve?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> It's something I've considered for some time now. Everyone glorifies the year's first sunrise, but why do they pay no attention to the year's last sunset?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> You're right, every year things are so busy on the evening of New Year's Eve that I don't think I've ever sat back and watched the sun go down.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Yeah yeah, me too-.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> But you know, if I were the sun, I'd be happy having everyone admire me on New Year's morning, but I think I'd want people admiring me on the last sunset after I worked so hard all year too!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I've never exactly thought about how it would make the sun feel...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I've always thought that those who can appreciate the sunset, the same as they would the sunrise, will get the most benefit from the year's first sunrise the next morning.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I get it! I think that's a great way of looking at it. It might give us better fortune from watching the sunrise, so I I'll try putting watching the sunset into our plan too!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Okaaay, now just to find the perfect place to watch the sunset with Chii-nee!  </p><h2 id="casual-20---mihono-end-at-the-years-final-sunset" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Casual 20 - Mihono: End]: At the Year's Final Sunset...</h2><p>On New Year's Eve. Partway through Mihono and Chie's trip together, they happened to meet Kiyoka, Sanae, and Yume, and all went to watch the sunset from an observation tower together.</p><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> Chii-nee, look, look! The setting sun looks so pretty!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> It sure is pretty, isn't it. Ah, Mihono-chan, it looks like we can go out onto the deck from there.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Whoa, the wind's strong out here. Chii-nee, be careful so your scarf doesn't get blown away, okay!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Right. You too, Mihono-chan; be sure your hat doesn't get swept off. Though, the air is nice and clear up here too.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah, it might be cold, but getting to see the sunset so clearly is the best! Oh yeah! Chii-nee, let's take a picture!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Another picture? You've been taking them nonstop ever since this morning.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> We're on a big trip together, so don't you want to have a bunch of things to remember it by? Kiyoka, could you take our picture with my phone?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I don't mind, but, Hono-chan, with all the pictures you're taking, your phone must be running out of space, right? I'll take it on my phone and send it to you later.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> You will? Thanks. That's a big help-.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Okay, Hono-chan, Setouchi-san, please come up with a pose!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Umm, a pose... What should we...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> If you want to give off a fun mood, how about if you do something like throwing both hands up in the air?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Like this? Banzai-!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Yeah, that's great, Hono-chan! Though, you still had your phone in your hand... Next, how about you stay just like that, but hold each other's hands?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> That might look good! Come on, hold my hand, Chii-nee! Yayyy!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> WAH---- What do I do!? I dropped my phone!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Eh-!? You mean right now, when we held hands?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I think so. It's not on the floor here, so don't tell me...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> You were swinging your hands all around, Onee-san, so I think it might've fallen all the way off the deck.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> No way...<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> This observation tower is a hundred meters up off the ground too. There's a cliff below us, so I don't think it could have hit anybody, but if it hit the rocks down there, it would have broken for sure...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I don't believe it... And I took so many pictures all day too-. Uuu... How could something like this happen...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Hono-chan, sorry. This all happened because I got carried away and asked you to do poses.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> It's not your fault, Kiyoka. I was the one who let go because I wasn't careful.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Sigh... For me to mess up this bad at the very very end of the year; my luck is the worst.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Don't look so sad, Mihono-chan. We might not be able to get the pictures back, but because of you, I've been having lots of fun all day.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> All the memories are right here in my heart, so it's fine. Here, raise up your head. We can still make plenty more memories together from now on.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Chii-nee...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ahh, the closeness between those two. It kind of makes you feel like tearing up, doesn't it?<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> I know. That closeness itself might be the best takeaway from this trip...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Hey, hey, somebody's phone's been ringing. It's ruining the mood. Whose is it?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> It isn't mine. ...Hm? Mihono-chan, isn't the ringing coming from behind you?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Huh? Now that you say it, I think so. But, my phone fell down the cliff...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Wait! Hono-chan, isn't there something in the hood of your parka?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Whoa-! It's my phone! It didn't fall down the cliff; it fell into my hood.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> I can hardly believe it. But, isn't that great for you, Asakura-san.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah, and it seems like all my photos are safe too. Sorry for making all of you worry, guys!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Good for you. But, wouldn't you normally notice if something fell into your hood, Onee-san?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I had no idea when it happened...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> You might not have been able to notice in the panic after you dropped it. But, I'm glad to see you're back to your happy self, Mihono-chan.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> By the way, your phone has been ringing for a while, hasn't it? Who's trying to get a hold of you?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ahhh! Yui sent me all these texts!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> "Where's those lovey dovey shots of you two you promised?" "The sun is already setting" "Hurry up-!" it says. Do you have to text her back?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> That reminds me, I did promise I'd send her pictures of Chii-nee and me together.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> But, all I took were normal pictures of us having fun sightseeing, so it's probably not anything like what Yui's expecting.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Fufu, in that case, I'll take one for you now. Hono-chan, hug up nice and close against Setouchi-san. Press your cheeks together too, and it'll look extra lovey dovey!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I-I can't do that out of nowhere-! It'd be embarrassing, right, Chii-nee?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Well, it is a little embarrassing, but since we are on a big trip, it might be nice to have photos like this too.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I guess so... Then, when in Rome! [hug-]!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Yeah, that pose looks perfect! I'm taking the picture now.
