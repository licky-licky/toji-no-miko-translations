I can't wait~! When it gets to be night, let's play cards! And also, I brought othello too.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Tsubakuro-san, we aren't going here to enjoy ourselves. Why not focus on completing our mission here first?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Yomi's right. Today we're on a joint assignment with other toji. As the elite guard, we need to always keep in mind that we set an example for the others...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Though, with this many of us here, we should be able to settle this quickly.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Yeah, and since I'm here, it'll be over right away. And besides, the other girls look like they're having fun too.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Sayaka-chan, that bento was delicious, wasn't it? Would you like to have something sweet for dessert too? I baked cookies, just for today.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Wow, there's so many.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Since I heard there would be lots of us on this overnight trip, I rolled up my sleeves making them, but maybe it was too much.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> No, I'm glad there's so many.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Ufufu, thank you. Would everyone from the elite guard like some too?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Can I? Thanks. If she's offering, we should just have snacktime with them! I'll work extra hard after we get there, so we can do it, can't we?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> I don't see why not; we should be building up our stamina right now...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> This is Shidou Maki. Did something come up?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> What!? Understood. We'll deal with it at once.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Maki-san? What's the matter?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> It sounds like there's been a large outbreak of aradama in the mountain forests here. Every moment counts, so we should get off the train here and deal with that first.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> But, if everyone gets off here, won't we be too late to complete our primary duty with this expedition?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Right, and HQ has a proposal for that. From here, we'll organize into two groups and carry out our missions separately.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Yume, along with Itomi Sayaka, the two of you will stay on this train to our original objective and start on the mission.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> The rest of us will get off the train now and hurry to the scene.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yume and Itomi-san? Those two are being sent alone to the mission point?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Shidou-san, would it be alright for me to to be with Sayaka-chan? Sending the two of them alone is just a little...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> I'm little unsure about it myself, but HQ named them directly, so they must have something in mind. Yume, Itomi Sayaka, what do you think?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Cause I'm so strong, it'll be easy peasy even if I do it by myself~. You can go with them, Sayaka-chan.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I can be fine if I do it by myself too. I'll defeat the aradama quickly, then meet up with you.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Nngh~, well I can beat them in a second, and then I'll meet up with you onee-sans faster than Sayaka-chan can!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Sigh... Unfortunately, it doesn't seem they have any intention of working together to defeat them.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> It's not helping my concerns, but, with each of their skills, they should be able to manage.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> We appear to have reached our stop. Everyone, let's go. Tsubakuro-san, I wish you luck.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Sayaka-chan, will you really be alright without me?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm. I can do my best if I have your cookies.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Sayaka-chan! In that case, take them all with you! Here! And here! And this batch too!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...It's heavy. But, thank you for all of them. I'll work hard.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Of course! Do your best, Sayaka-chan.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> You too, Yume. Try to get along with Itomi-san.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> They're gone now.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm...<br><strong>Yume/Sayaka:</strong> ....................................<br><strong>Yume:</strong> WAHH-! If we just stay quiet this whole time, I'll get so bored I'll die!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I know! I came up with something good. Sayaka-chan, since it's just us two, wanna have a competition?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> A competition?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Yeah. A competition to see who can beat the most aradama! I'm pretty sure I'll win, but it'll still be fun, won't it?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...Okay, but, I probably won't lose.  </p><h2 id="2-yume-and-sayakas-showdown-begins" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>2: Yume and Sayaka's Showdown Begins!</h2><p><strong>Aradama:</strong> GUOOOOO...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Kyahaha, a whole bunch came out! Anyway, Sayaka-chan, our competition's starting! EIIIII--!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I won't... lose either...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Not bad, Sayaka-chan! I think I should start getting serious soon too! YAAAAAHH!<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> Keeeee...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Huh? Is it over already?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> It looks like it...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ahaha, they were so weak-! Hey, hey, how many did you beat, Sayaka-chan?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I think I got about fifty...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> No way-! That's how many I got! Boo~, so it's a draw then, huhh. But, for sure next time, I'm not gonna lose!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm... I won't lose either.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Hello, Maki-onee-san? It was easy as pie over here, you know? ...Yeah, I got it. We'll go ahead.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Shidou Maki? What did she want?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> It's about our rooms at the ryokan. The elite guard got a Japanese style room, and everyone else got a Western style room, so she said to go ahead and wait there for them.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Are Mai and the others not here yet? This room is... too big by myself...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Are those onee-sans still not hereee? I got the cards and othello board all set up, but this is boring-.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mai, she's still not here. But, we promised... We'd go in the hot springs together...<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mai's calling. Hello?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Sayaka-chan, I'm sorry. We safely finished eliminating the aradama, but we didn't make it in time for the last bus, so we won't be able to make it back there tonight.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Eh...?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I'm sorry about this. I know you'll be lonely by yourself, but just rest up in preparation for tomorrow, okay?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I understand. Okay... Then, bye.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I'm alone until morning...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Hello, Maki-onee-san? Huh? Stop calling over and over? But, it's so boring being by myself.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> If you're bored, then why not play with Itomi Sayaka? Don't you think she's bored by herself too?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I can't do that, because we promised we'd settle things tomorrow morning. If we start getting along, then it won't be a competition!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Hey, if you're busy, Maki-onee-san, then what about Yomi-onee-san or Suzuka-onee-san? I don't care which one, so let me talk to them, okay-?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> She handed the phone to me. Tsubakuro-san, I remembered hearing a very interesting rumor about the inn we booked...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Eh-, like what, like what? Is it a funny story? I wanna know~! Tell me!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> As the rumor goes, a ghost is said to appear in the inn you're staying at. Have you seen it yet?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> EHH---!? What do you mean? Nobody said anything like that to me! Where is it? Where's it supposed to come out!?  
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Ah, I'm sorry, I'm being called for something, so you'll have to excuse me. Anyway, have a nice night, Tsubakuro-san...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> EHHHHH-!? Hang on, Yomi-onee-san! ......She hung up.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> W-Well, stuff like ghosts isn't scary or anything! Cause, I'm super strong and all. There's nothing I can't beat... ...Ah-- But, can you beat a ghost with an okatana?        [Minor trivia, Yume's okatana, Nikkari Ao'e, actually got its name for a legend in which it killed a ghost]<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I didn't notice it, but it's completely dark outside. ...I can't take this anymore! I don't wanna stay here all alone by myself until morning--!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Oh, I got it! Sayaka-chan might be scared all by herself. Since I'm so strong, I'll go and help Sayaka-chan out.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I'll bring my snacks, and my cards, and othello with me... Okay, here I go!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Wait, th-there it is---! The ghost----!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Tsubakuro Yume? What's wrong? Was there a ghost?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ah-- Sayaka-chan. Th-That's not it! There's no way a ghost was here! Geez-, don't scare me like that, okay? And, what's with you? What do you have all those snacks for.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Can I sleep in this room?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Huh?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> It's lonely, being in a big room by yourself... And, I thought... Maybe Tsubakuro Yume was feeling the same way... Do you want to eat Mai's cookies together?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> W-Well I wasn't scared of ghosts or feeling lonely or anything, but if that's what you wanna do, then that's okay-!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> (Thank goodness. If Sayaka-chan is here with me, I should be fine.)  </p><h2 id="3-the-result-of-their-competition-is" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>3: The Result of Their Competition Is...</h2><p><strong>Yume:</strong> These cookies are actually really tasty! I feel like I could eat them forever.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> That's good. I think Mai will be happy to hear it too.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Hey, hey, Sayaka-chan, after we're done eating, let's play othello! We kept getting ties in cards, but I won't lose for sure at othello!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm. I'll try it...<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Ah, you took a corner again... You're tough, Tsubakuro Yume.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> This much is nothing-. Maki-onee-san and them are always training me super hard.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> So you do things like that too... I'm a little surprised.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Even though they're always treating me like a little kid, they never go easy on me when we're playing games-. Really, they can be so immature it's annoying.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> What about you, Sayaka-chan? Don't the onee-sans always treat you like a little kid?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Ummm... I... It doesn't bother me at all, but the others, they say that Mai's... She's too overprotective of me...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Hmm. It sorta seems like we both have it hard, being the youngest, don't we.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm... Ah, if I put this here...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> No way! You flipped that many!? You turned the game around in one go. Now I don't have anywhere to put any!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I win...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Mmgh... That's only cause I got a little distracted talking to you now! We're playing again! I'm not stopping until I win!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> That's fine, but... I'm a little tired... I'll take a short rest...<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> [snooze]...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh-, hey, Sayaka-chan! Wait... She's really asleep now.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Well, if you're gonna be like that, then I guess I'll have to let you borrow my futon!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Yawn~, looking at Sayaka-chan while she's sleeping is making me feel sleepy too... Nn...<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Tsubakuro Yume, wake up. Your phone is ringing.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> It's Maki-onee-san. What's she want? Hello-?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Yume, take Itomi with you and head to the site of the mission. From the sound of things, the count of aradama there now dwarfs the amount yesterday.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> We're headed there too right now, but it's going to be a while before we arrive. Could you two find a way to hold out there on your own?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Yeah, me and Sayaka-chan'll be fine. We'll finish it up before you onee-sans even get there. Right-, Sayaka-chan?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Right... Let's go.<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> GUOOOOOOOOO!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Uwah-, it's true! There's way more of them today-!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> This looks... a little difficult today.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> This'll be a piece of cake. Sayaka-chan, let's have another competition to see who can beat the most again today!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ......Hey, Tsubakuro Yume... Instead of a competition today, what if we work together?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Work together? But, we can't tell which one of us wins if we do that.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> We still haven't done... the punishment game for othello last night. So... can I make your punishment that we have to fight together?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Nngh... If you say so, then... Fine, but just for today!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Okay. Then... Let's go.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I'm next! HAAAH!!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Pant... Pant... I can finally... see the end of them. Let's finish... the last of them together.<br><strong>Yume/Sayaka:</strong> YAAA-----------!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> We did it-! I thought it would be a little bit harder, but now that it's over, we beat them pretty easy, huh.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm. It's because you were helping me, Tsubakuro Yume.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> ...Then, let's do a high five! Yaay-!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> What's going on here?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Sayaka-chan and Tsubakuro-san, high fiving...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ah-- You're late, onee-sans-! We already took care of it with just the two of us.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Eh!? The two of you took care of all those aradama?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> When we put our skills together, it was as easy as that! See, Sayaka-chan, she's really strong!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> No, you did a lot of the work, Tsubakuro Yume. You really are... very strong.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> They seem to have gotten much closer while we were away.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> That's for sure.
