These are now your loyal soldiers, Princess. Please use them as you see fit.<br><strong>Tagitsuhime:</strong> ......<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> On that note, President Souraku. Not all the pawns set to be her soldiers are here, because you let one slip out from under your nose. How disgraceful.<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> If only you had restrained them sooner. This only happened thanks to all the time you wasted.<br><strong>Yuzuki:</strong> ............<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> And you too, Yomi. Just how useless are you going to be?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ............<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> Hmph! Well, it hardly matters. A rat running loose won't do anything to upset our superiority.<br><strong>Yuzuki:</strong> Yukina...<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Steady yourself, President Souraku. It's too late to stop now.<br><strong>Yuzuki:</strong> ...You're right. Yes, I can't stop this. In which case...<br><strong>Sana:</strong> An imperial guard formed to protect Tagitsuhime. And "Myouga toji", strengthened with noro...<br><strong>Sana:</strong> It looks like a confrontation with both President Takatsu and Souraku is inevitable at this point.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Why are people fighting against each other...?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I couldn't help but notice, I don't see Yamashiro Yui or Suzumoto Hana anywhere. Where are they?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> ...You're the only one who's come back.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I was... The only one?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah, but you know, they could still be on their way here right now.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah, that's right! Or maybe they found a place to hide somewhere!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Those two aren't gonna get taken down so easy. How many rough spots do you think we've gotten out of so far?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Yes, that's true...<br><strong>Sana:</strong> That imperial guard of theirs is going to give us trouble in a fight. Powered up on noro, they'd be too much for our toji stationed at the Ministry of Defense.<br><strong>Sana:</strong> We have to avoid the worst case scenario at all costs. I'm sending you four to help protect Takirihime as soon as possible. Kitora, you go back to the infirmary and rest.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I'm joining them as well.<br><strong>Sana:</strong> I admit, your injuries weren't as bad as they looked, but still...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I am fine. There's no reason to keep me here.<br><strong>Sana:</strong> Listen...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> If Mirja said she's good to go, then that's all there is to it.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Mmhm, I was shocked before, but Mirja-san wouldn't say she'd do something she couldn't. Of course I'm still worried, but I know she'll be fine.<br><strong>Sana:</strong> Are you serious about this?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> We've been fighting together for long enough. If Mirja-san says she can handle this, I'll trust her.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Me too.<br><strong>Sana:</strong> And now you're all ganging up on me... Sigh~~... Have it your way. I'll approve of you going with them.

Will you lend us your strength, Takirihime?<br><strong>Akane:</strong> If you agree to join forces with us against Tagitsuhime, that would bring us one step closer to your wish of humans and aradama coexisting.<br><strong>Takirihime:</strong> Insolence.<br><strong>Takirihime:</strong> What I demand from you humans is your servitude, not to fight as your equal.<br><strong>Takirihime:</strong> Submit Ichikishimahime to me. Do so, and I will allow you to live under my protection.<br><strong>Akane:</strong> Please wait. Is that what you meant by "coexisting"?<br><strong>Takirihime:</strong> Naturally. The immature species known as humans are no different from insects and beasts. I shall guide them on a better path, toward true coexistence.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...That's enough, Akane-sama.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> There's no doubt about it now. This is just another aradama, like Tagitsuhime. There's no chance of us coexisting.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> ............<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> ...Um, Takirihime-san?

What are your intentions, Chidori?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> This whole time, you haven't even looked at us once. That's why we aren't able to make any progress together.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> That's why... Um... I just thought that, if we get a good look at each other, humans and aradama would be able to understand each other better, is all...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> And you think meeting face to face with your okatana is the simplest way to do that?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah...<br><strong>Takirihime:</strong> Hmph. A ridiculous proposal. Enough... Leave.<br>At the same time, near the Ichigaya garrison--</p><p><strong>Chie:</strong> We're almost to the Ministry of Defense.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You're sweating so much, Mirja-san... Are you really okay?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> It's not a problem. The painkillers have worn off is all.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> You know, you're the one who's always saying to keep it in check. Just look at yourself.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> There is not going to be a problem. If anything, now that they've worn off, the pain will keep me alert.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> How stubborn can you be!?  
<strong>Aradama:</strong> GYAAAAUUU!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Aradama!? And this many of them too...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> It would be hard getting around them all.

After such a great span of time...)<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Ne-!<br><strong>Takirihime:</strong> The impurity of noro... It should be impossible to cleanse. But humans managed to do so.<br><strong>Takirihime:</strong> As a species, they are imperfect, with such short lives. But through such a simple method, through living alongside them for so long...<br><strong>Takirihime:</strong> Is such a thing possible?

I think I might be too tired by the time we get to the Ministry of Defense.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> With all these obstacles getting in our way, I'm beginning to think we might not even make it there in time.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> With their persistence... They must strongly want for us not to reach the Ministry of Defense.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> It's starting to get on my nerves. Just let us through already!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Huh? Fukki, I thought you'd be happy, getting to fight all these aradama.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Tagitsuhime might be waiting on the other side. Doesn't that sound way more exciting than fighting these nobodies!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ahh, that explains it. You never change, Fukki.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> But, without Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu, I thought we couldn't defeat Tagitsuhime?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> If we beat on her enough, she'll go running home. That's enough for now, right?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> True, with our objective being to guard, if Tagitsuhime were to retreat, the mission could then be considered a success.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> See? I've been thinking this through.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Fukki actually used her head!?  
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> She just wants to play with Tagitsuhime though...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Oiii. You two, meet me behind the gym later.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Ah-!! Everyone, look over there...! In the direction of the Ministry of Defense...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> There's a fire...

There's no time to waste!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Before that, looks like some other group came to get us.<br><strong>Imperial Guard:</strong> We won't let you past here.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Huh? What's your deal?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> They're Ayanokouji toji?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Is this... The imperial guard?

For them to be this tough... This is the power of noro...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I would like for us to stop and recover here, but given the situation, we can't afford to. Let's head to the Ministry of Defense without delay.<br><strong>???:</strong> Ehh~? We came all this way to see you, so don't go saying something mean like you're gonna leave us here~.

<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Then... This... This can't be happening...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> ...I don't want to believe it, but this is the reality we have to face. President Souraku... This is too cruel.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Eh... Guys, what are you saying? I-It's Yui and Hana! They came back!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> They aren't our friends anymore. No friend of ours would come looking ready to fight like that! Mihocchi, get it through your head already!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> You're wrong!!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Come on, you two...

If the situation arises, we need to be ready to fight her.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Maybe a good thing Yume's still recovering. Even against Yomi, I doubt she'd hold anything back.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I wouldn't be so sure about that.
