I always forget to put on sunscreen too, even though I really should...<br><strong>Akira:</strong> I know it's easy to forget, but you've gotta do it. You're gonna be hurting later otherwise.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> ...You actually do that kind of thing properly, huh, Inago-san. I sort of didn't expect that from you...<br><strong>Akira:</strong> It's one of the must haves when you're doing a bike tour in the summertime.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Even Inago-san is telling you, so you have to make sure to put sunscreen on, Kanami-chan. Wouldn't you have forgotten today if I hadn't reminded you?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ahaha...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Are you still letting Mai do everything for you?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> That's only because Mai-chan's always noticing all kinds of things.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> By the way, Hiyori-chan, Mai-chan. Since we worked up a sweat, want to take a shower and then have some fun in the pool?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> The pool... Well, it's definitely hot enough for it.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> That sounds nice; I think I'll go.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> And of course, you're invited too, Inago-san, Kitora-san!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I see. I'll take you up on your offer.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Bring it on! Let's get going!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah, before we get changed, I'm going to get something to drink! If anybody wants me to get them anything, just say so-.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> How about; could you get me some cold Japanese tea?<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Good looking out, Kanami. I'll take a cola!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I still have the mineral water I brought along for our mission, but, could I ask you to get another of the same kind?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Got it-. What about you, Mai-chan?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I can't think of anything off the top of my head, so I'll go with you. You'll have your hands full buying all those drinks anyway.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Thanks! I was actually feeling a little hungry too, so I thought I'd buy some snacks while I was at it. With you along, I can get a bunch--<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> ...Huh?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> What's the matter?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> The door won't open for some reason.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Eh... You're right... I can't get it to move an inch.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Out of the way for a sec. --ORAA!<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Damnit, no matter how many kicks I give it, it won't budge. What's the deal...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I asked Sayaka-chan and Shichinosato-san, who were at Renpu, to call a staff member, but...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> We're completely trapped in here, aren't we.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Why doesn't this place have air conditioning when the window's built into the wall and you can't even open it...!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> We don't even know how long it'll take before the staff get here, but we'll cook in here like this...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ...This is an extremely undesirable situation. The only drinks we have are my and Yanase Mai's mineral waters.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> We do have some food too, but only these cookies I made.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Just as Etou Kanami said, if we simply wait like this for rescue, we all risk dehydration.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> For sure. Okay, I'm busting the window open.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> S-Stop right there, Inago Akira!<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Huh? If we don't let the hot air out, we're dehydrating, right? So we've gotta break the window, don't we?<br><strong>Akira:</strong> That'll let us call out for help too, so it's two birds with one stone.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> It is not two birds with one stone! We should start by thinking of our other options!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Th-That's right. Breaking the window should be our last resort...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...What are you even doing.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Mai, let's test and see if there's any way we can get this door open.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Okay, Hiyori-chan. There might be something that can help left in the lockers here too--<br><strong>Mai:</strong> ...EH!?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> What's wrong!?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I-In the locker, there's a person covered in blood...!!<br><strong>Akira/Kanami/Mirja:</strong> ...A-A DEAD BODY!?!?  </p><h2 id="2-a-murder-case-in-a-hot-and-humid-locked-room" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>2: A Murder Case in a Hot and Humid Locked Room...?</h2><p><strong>Kanami:</strong> Wh-Wh-What happened!? When they fell out, it made a huge noise, and...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Calm down, Kanami. First we need to check the body.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ......<br><strong>Akira:</strong> I'll... do the checking. Anybody who doesn't want to see, turn away.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Inago-san...!<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Sorry. Let me just... get a look at your face--<br><strong>Yui:</strong> If it's you, Boss, you can look over every little inch of me!<br><strong>Akira:</strong> ...Wait, Yui!? All that blood-- Are you okay!?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> I'm just fine. This is only from a nosebleed I got.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> That's a nosebleed...? Ugh, and now I've got your nosebleed on me...!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Ehehe. Sorry about that, Boss. If you take your clothes off for me, I'll wash them and give them back to you.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> ...I'll wash 'em myself.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> More importantly... Why were you inside that locker?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> See, I hid in there so I could peep on girls while they were changing, but it got way too hot and I got all dizzy. Ahaha.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Err...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Seeing you come out of the locker, I assumed it was something like that...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> That's my Mirja-san! We know each other inside and out!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Sigh... This feels more uncomfortably hot than usual.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> That cold attitude of yours feels nice and refreshing to me, Mirja-san!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong>  It's a relief at least to see you're doing okay. Anyway, let's all try pushing on the door.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> I guess it's... better than doing nothing.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> What if... the lock is stuck in a strange way?<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Moving around makes it feel even hotter in here... Aghh... If I just had my okatana, this door wouldn't even be a problem...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> It's not as if I don't understand how you feel, but that would be a problem in and of itself.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> I get that. And, I might've made things even worse with all the kicking I did...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> There's no use worrying over that. None of us made an attempt to stop you at the time either.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> It doesn't seem like there's anything in the locker room we can use... Maybe our best bet is just to sit tight and wait for help to get here.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Considering our situation, it would be wise to preserve our stamina as best as possible.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Though, there's little we can do besides stay still and avoid the areas where sunlight shines in.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> [gulp gulp]... Phew. The water is pretty warm at this point, but, if you drink some, you'll feel better.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> We don't have that much left, though you shouldn't push yourselves too hard, so don't hold back if you need it.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Okay. And also, Mai-chan, could I have some cookies too?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> ...I think your throat would feel dry after eating them, but, so long as you don't mind that.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I'm really starving now.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Mmm, every time I have them, Mai-chan's cookies are just too good!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Give me some too! I want Mai-chan's handmade cookies!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Ahhh... This is the taste of Mai-chan.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Mm... Now my mouth's all dried out...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> That's why I told you. Here, have some water.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Mmnn...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Ah...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ......<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Phwah. It feels like you've been helping me out every step of the way today, Mai-chan.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Mirja-san, please let me have some of your water-.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Here you go.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> I'm drinking it, Mirja-san!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ...I'd appreciate it if you didn't mention my name every time.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Yui, let me see it next. It's rough sweating this much without anything to drink.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Both of you, please be careful not to drink too much. What little we have is precious.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Do you want a drink too, Hiyori-chan?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...Sure. I'll have just a few sips.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I never thought I'd be this grateful for some water, huh-.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> [gulp gulp]... It's not something you'd normally pay attention to.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ......<br><strong>Mai:</strong> ......<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Let's keep this up and pull through! I'm sure we only have to wait a little bit longer!  </p><h2 id="3-a-flash-of-inspiration-in-the-steamy-heat" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>3: A Flash of Inspiration in the Steamy Heat...!</h2><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Ughh... It's so hot it makes me want to tie up my hair.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Your hair is pretty long, Hiyori-chan.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> If only I had a hair tie on me.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> It's fine, Mai. If I bunch it up with my hand like this, it already feels a lot different.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Kh... With her hair bunched up like that, I'm getting hit with a rare side of Hiyori-chan's charms... Her nape's so cute too!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Between how hot and muggy it is in here, I can't even bring myself to say anything.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Are you doing okay, Hiyori-chan? As an apology, I'll fan you. How's that? Does it feel cooler?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...A little bit. Still, why are you...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Y-Yui-chan!? Fanning your skirt around... You shouldn't do that!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> But, this fans the most air, doesn't it? I don't have a real fan or any kind of sheet to use.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Yui, do it over my way too.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> I'm on it!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> With all this heat, our standards of judgment are evaporating...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Then, I'm doing it too! If we both fan with our skirts, I'm sure it'll--<br><strong>Mai:</strong> YOU ARE NOT DOING THAT! ABSOLUTELY NOT!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> ...O-Okay!?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> That goes for everyone else too! As a toji, and as a girl... Please act with some decency!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> We're all out of water by now... aren't we.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> We all drank it little by little, but in this heat, it wouldn't last regardless.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> On top of that, the sweat and humidity's making my shirt sticky and gross...<br><strong>Akira:</strong> What Mai said's still right and all, but... You gotta compromise at some point. I'm taking my clothes off.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> ...I-Inago-san?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Me too...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> What matters most is preserving our lives... Taking that option is unavoidable.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> ...!?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Mai-chan... We came here to put on our swimsuits anyway, so this really isn't all that different!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Ehhh...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> (...Is it though? I feel like it's still wrong...)<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Ahh~... If this is the last thing I see before I die, I'll die satisfied...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I want to say this is the same as her usual self, but... Even Yamashiro Yui is in poor condition.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> It's open...! Mai, Kanami, Hiyori!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Sayaka-chan! Ahh~... I'm so glad to see you.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> So hot... What is this, a sauna? Everybody still alive~?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...Wait, what're you all looking like that for!? Well, I guess if it's this hot, what else can you do.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> We brought you stuff to drink. You'd better be grateful!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> We're in your debt... Shichinosato Kofuki, Itomi Sayaka.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> [gulp gulp gulp]... Ahh. Who'd have thought some ice cold water'd be this tasty. Seriously... You saved our asses.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Kanami and everyone else, you should drink too.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Sure!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> We were right at our limit...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> We really were... The water bottle feels so cool and nice...<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> You too, Yui. It's cold and tasty.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Thanks, Sayaka-chan! You're an angel!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> No, don't mention it.  </p><h2 id="4-a-moment-at-a-summer-festival-spent-with-fireworks" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>4: A Moment at a Summer Festival Spent with Fireworks</h2><p><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mai. Do you have free time the day after tomorrow?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I think I should be available. Why?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> There's going to be a festival nearby. I want to go together.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Because we've been busy with missions, I haven't been together with you lately. I think the festival will definitely be fun.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> You're probably right. Why don't we go enjoy ourselves together, since it's been a while.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...Mm!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mai, she's still not here. I didn't get any messages either... What happened?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> (Mai will come for sure. I want to take a look around at everything, so Mai can have fun when she gets here.)<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I think she'll be hungry when she arrives, so, takoyaki... or yakisoba? They have okonomiyaki too. I can't decide.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> After that, we can eat shaved ice while we watch the fireworks... It might be fun to try the shooting range and goldfish scooping too.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...Nn. I smell something sweet... from over this way.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> "Baby castella"...?<br><strong>Stall Worker:</strong> Missy, you never eaten one of them before?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I haven't.<br><strong>Stall Worker:</strong> Go on and try one. If you like it, come and buy some more. Here.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Thank you.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> -! It's tasty...<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> After I meet with my friend, I'll come buy some for sure.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> (If I eat these with Mai, I know it'll taste even better...)<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> In a few minutes... it'll be 8 o'clock. The fireworks will be over soon too. Today is already...<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> (Will I not get to go around the festival with Mai...?)<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Sayaka-chan... I'm sorry! I didn't think I would be this late.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mai...!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> My phone ran out of batteries too, so I couldn't contact you. Ahh, thank goodness I found you.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm. We can see the last fireworks too. You made it in time.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Ah, there they go! Woww, it's so pretty... Look, Sayaka-chan.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> They're twinkling... That's amazing.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> As you'd expect from the last rocket, it sure had a lot of impact. What should we do from here?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I thought of a lot of places I wanted to go see with you.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> In that case, I guess I'll leave everything to you, Sayaka-chan.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm. This way! First, we'll--<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Since we were their last customers, the takoyaki stall gave us some extra.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> The extras... There were kind of a lot of them.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I think my belly might be full after that... But I want to eat these with you, Mai.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> They were really tasty.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> These are baby castella? Then, I'll have some. --Mmm, they're sweet and delicious.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> They're soft and covered in lots of maple syrup... I feel like I could eat any amount of them... Ohm.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> You really seem to like them. I don't eat them very often myself, but I do like them too.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> (It shouldn't be that hard to make baby castella. Maybe I'll make them for her as a snack next time?)<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> There were still... more places I wanted to see with you though.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Lots of them have already started closing up their stalls, haven't they.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> But, I'm glad I got to see the festival with you, Mai.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I feel the same way. Thank you for inviting me. Let's go out again some other day, when we don't have missions.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Okay!  </p><h2 id="5-the-smells-of-summer-and-canteen-cooked-rice" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>5: The Smells of Summer and Canteen Cooked Rice</h2><p><strong>Akira:</strong> Ahh, even in the summer, it feels nice and fresh in the morning up on a plateau!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> You're right. The air is cool and clear.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Right? Didn't I call it when I said we should spend the night here?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Though, after you suggested we camp here right after our mission, I did wonder if you had lost your mind.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> ...Ouch. The people at the campsite even said they'd lend us their equipment. We just had to buy something to eat.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> It was probably a good change of pace for the rest of them too, and anyway, I'm hungry, so let's get to making breakfast!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Alright. I'd like something warm to eat. More specifically, I'd like freshly cooked rice.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Figured you'd say that. I'm counting on you for the rice. I'll be getting the perfect side dish ready for it.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Please do.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Hey. That rice you've got cooking smells good.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I had the rice soak in water, so it should cook nicely.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Though, if I wanted to cook it to the best of my ability, I would want to let it soak for another thirty minutes or so...<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Waiting an hour to eat is pushing it, don't you think.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ......<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Isn't rice something you should put up with an empty stomach for?<br><strong>Akira:</strong> It's not like I don't get you, but, after I went and foil roasted this salmon, I don't want it getting cold.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> I threw in a bunch of onions, carrots, and shimeji mushrooms too. You're gonna love it.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> It seems like it would complement the rice.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> What, is rice the main dish here...? Ahh, this smell's making me want miso soup now. I shoulda bought some while I was out.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> We both... made some oversights.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> The rice should be cooked. Once it's steamed for a bit, we can eat.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Mmm~~, that's so good! You seriously cook rice better than anybody!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> You flatter me too much. The roasted salmon and soft-boiled eggs you made are delicious too.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Yeah, but that's all easy stuff to make.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Seeing you staring down that canteen of rice earlier, it reminded me of that school camp trip we did back in 5th grade. Didn't you cook us rice back then too?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I did. It was my first time cooking outdoors with a canteen, but I really wanted to try it.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Back then... I was too slow in turning the rice over, so lots of it ended up scorched at the bottom.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> But y'know, I still really like rice when it's scorched. And we were having curry, so nobody cared much.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> That school camping trip sure was fun. We couldn't get to sleep, so we stayed up talking, and then the teacher got mad.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> That was because you were talking too loudly.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Was it? You remember that pretty good. Hard to think that back then, we still didn't even know yet if we'd be toji-.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I know.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I wouldn't have imagined you would go dye your hair like that either, Akira.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Here I am going a little down memory lane, and you've gotta bring that up? You think it doesn't look good on me? It looks good, right...?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> It does look good.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> See?<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Anyway, we're done eating, so how 'bout we clean things up before we head back-.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Let's.<br><a href="https://streamable.com/sut446">https://streamable.com/sut446</a></p><h2 id="swimsuit-20---mirja-start-stroll" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Swimsuit 20 - Mirja: Start]: Stroll</h2><p>On a day off...</p><p><strong>Yui:</strong> Hahh...

Why not go enjoy yourself with Asakura Mihono and the others?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> No way, I'm not going back! I'll be there to protect your pale skin, Mirja-san...!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Until I rub sunscreen all over you with my own hands!!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Anyway, because it's down by the river, the air here is cooler than I expected.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> And there's such fine weather today.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> That's for sure, it is really nice out...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ......In spite of that, it looks to me like you're struggling quite a bit?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> That's because... I couldn't sleep much last night, and I didn't eat breakfast either...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Honestly... Here, have this.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Is that ramune? Thanks......<br><strong>Yui:</strong> PFHAGH!?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> What's with this!? It's sweet and sour and bitter and solid and salty and sourly sour!?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> It's the ramune Ban Tsugumi gave me to combat the summer heat.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Kn-Knowing that it's Tsugumi-san's... I'm not surprised it's awful...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ...It looks like it was a little overwhelming.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Why don't we stop and take a short rest here?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Sounds great!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Mirja-san, since we're already in our swimsuits, let's go in the river!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ......<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Do you not want to...?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> No, it is what we came here for, so I'll enjoy myself as well.<br><a href="https://streamable.com/sig5hu">https://streamable.com/sig5hu</a></p><h2 id="swimsuit-20---mirja-end-a-short-rest" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Swimsuit 20 - Mirja: End]: A Short Rest</h2><p><strong>Yui:</strong> YAHOOO-!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Phew...

Given the season, perhaps they were Ayu?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> You think so?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> You can also catch Amago, Yamame, and Iwana during the summertime. Though, I'm unsure if those fish would be in this river here...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> We should've brought a fishing rod with us. If there were that many fish, we might've been able to go all out for our lunch.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> True, we potentially could have, though... As beginners, I'm not sure how many we would be able to fish out...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Well, forget about that for now; hurry up and come in the water!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Alright then... Mm!?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> What's wrong?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Just now, a spider went drifting by.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> A spider!?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Wh-Wh-Wh-Where was it!?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> It's about to pass right in front of you.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Eh? ...GYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Mirja-san, there's a spider!
