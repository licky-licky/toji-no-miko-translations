This might be tough.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I'm thinking about trying to improve my concentration, but, am I really doing it, you know?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Though... If we don't do it, we won't wake up from this dream, will we...?<br><strong>Erika:</strong> Aren't you overthinking this a little, Mihono, Kiyoka? If you're getting into your ideal state, you should be able to do it even when you're relaxed.<br><strong>Erika:</strong> Take Kanami for example. She's having fun challenging everybody to matches, see?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> That's cause it's so much fun!<br><strong>Erika:</strong> And, saying that, I've gone along with her countless times.<br><strong>Angelina:</strong> I stopped by to watch partway through, and they kept going for over an hour.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Kanami's really something.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Erika-san's swordsmanship has this unfamiliar feeling to it, so I just can't help but want to see more!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Hmm. Erika-onee-san, are you strong?<br><strong>Erika:</strong> What's that-? You want to go too, Yume?<br><strong>Mayumi:</strong> Chiba-san, you're such a popular girl.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Nnn, that wouldn't be bad either, but...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Since this is supposed to be a dream, I wanna try doing something even more exciting!<br><strong>Erika:</strong> Whoops, I got rejected. So, what kind of exciting things did you have in mind?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I want to use magic!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I know there's magic in the world you onee-sans come from, so maybe I can do it too here, since it's a dream!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> You're not giving up on that, huh, Yume.<br><strong>Honoka:</strong> If you could use magic, what sort of things would you like to do, Yume-chan?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Let me see... Maybe fly in the sky? That'd be fun for sure, and it'd probably feel good to fly wherever you want!<br><strong>Miyuki:</strong> Flight magic, then. In our world, provided you have enough magic power, we've shown that's a technique many magicians are capable of using.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> You've flown in the sky before!?  
<strong>Miyuki:</strong> I have. My first experience with it was highly enjoyable, and I felt proud to be a part of it.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> That's so cool-! I want to fly too!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> That's awesome! So you really can fly around in the sky-.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Since it's a dream, if you jumped down from one of the school windows or somewhere up high, maybe you'd start flying-?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> So long as you decide that your ideal self should be able to fly around!<br><strong>Mihono/Kanami:</strong> Ah-!?  
<strong>Maki:</strong> I was wondering what all the excitement was about... Yume... You can't know that for sure, so give it up.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> And, Asakura and Etou. Could you not look at her like she just came up with something genius?<br><strong>Mihono/Kanami:</strong> Ahaha...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh. It's okay if I'm just going to give it a try, right-?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yume. We may be within a dream, but you still feel pain here, don't you?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I'm sure that Ban-san has prepared some sort of safety mechanism, but, if worse comes to worst, we can't be certain it won't have an effect on your body or mind.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ehhh.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Flying in the air does sound incredible, but I think this dream has a lot of limitations to it.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Even if we wish for it, the aradama won't just up and vanish in an instant. ...[chomp]<br><strong>Yume:</strong> What's that you've got there, Onee-san?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Chocolate mint ice cream... [chomp]<br><strong>Shizuku:</strong> ...[chomp]. Though, I know the feeling of wanting to try something since it's a dream. The magic we use can't do everything, after all.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> ...I don't really want to hear anything from you onee-sans while you're all satisfied eating your dream ice cream though-.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...Ngh.<br><strong>Miyuki:</strong> Fufu, it seems she's struck a sore spot, Hiyori-san.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Yeah, yeah. I only wanted to try it a little bit too.<br><strong>Miyuki:</strong> You're just brimming with curiosity, aren't you, Yume-san.<br><strong>Miyuki:</strong> However, even if this dream may seem both real and fantastical, doesn't it seem difficult for anything out of a fairytale to appear, like a house made of candy?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yes. It's likely just as Shiba-san says; it's unlikely anything can happen that strays too far from our common sense of the world.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> That's how it is, Yume. You'll just have to live with it.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Grr--! Fine then! I'm not going to ask you onee-sans what to do anymore!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah... Yume-chan!?  
<strong>Maki:</strong> Wait... Yume!  </p><h2 id="2-chasing-yume--------like-in-the-events-title-yume-isnt-written-in-kanji-here-so-it-could-mean-both-yume-and-dreams" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>2: Chasing Yume        [Like in the event's title, Yume isn't written in kanji here, so it could mean both Yume and dreams]</h2><p><strong>Mayumi:</strong> This here. It looks like Tsubakuro-san dropped it earlier. I think it's some sort of character keyring.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> That's the mascot character, Ichigo Daifuku Neko.<br><strong>Honoka:</strong> Ah, now that you mention it, it looks like it has a strawberry daifuku motif. It's cute...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Yume really likes that character.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Still... Yume completely blew her top back there.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...We'll have to think up something else besides simply searching for her.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Even if we can't go as far as making her fly... So long as we had something else that'll make her happy.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> That's just it...<br><strong>Suzuka/Maki:</strong> ...!<br><strong>Miyuki:</strong> ?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Sorry to ask you this so suddenly, but... Is there any way you could make Yume happy with your magic? Of course, if it's too difficult, I won't blame you for refusing.<br><strong>Angelina:</strong> You and Suzuka both seem strict on her, but actually... You're very sweet with that girl, aren't you?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> We have to give her a proper warning, but she is something like a little sister to us.<br><strong>Miyuki:</strong> I don't have anything specific in mind now, but, could we think on it a little?<br><strong>Honoka:</strong> You're doing so much for us, so I want to help too.<br><strong>Mayumi:</strong> Let's pitch in for Tsubakuro-san's sake. If we're going to make her happy, we might as well give her a surprise that she can't help but smile with.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Thank you, all of you. If you think of anything at all that you need, please ask us without hesitation.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Then, Yomi and I will go looking for Yume.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ...There's a possibility that Tsubakuro-san didn't give up on trying to fly, after all.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I'll help look for Yume-chan too!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Shidou-san, Satsuki-san. I'll go too!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> That would be a great help. Thank you very much.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Then, let's move quick. I'd appreciate if you girls did what you could too.<br><strong>Mayumi:</strong> Of course; you can count on us.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ...If she's already left the school, we'll have to go outside.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> I thought she might be on the roof or one of the upper floors, but couldn't find anything...<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes. I thought the same thing.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Still, I didn't expect this. For you to help with the search.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> I was looking where she might jump down. I'm just thinking, when I was talking to her, I should have chosen my words a bit more carefully.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Let's search elsewhere.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Right. We should meet up with Shidou-san and the others for now.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> ...You didn't find anything either, Yomi?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Unfortunately.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> I see. Then, we'll just have to take things slow and steady.<br><strong>Erika:</strong> We're going to help you too.<br><strong>Erika:</strong> Lina and I looked around this area earlier, but we didn't find her. She wasn't in her room or anything, was she?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Thank you very much, both of you. Yes, I just checked there.<br><strong>Angelina:</strong> If we're going to find Yume, I'd like to have some kind of lead first. Do you have anything like that?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Since she said she wanted to try flying before she ran out, it's possible she might try jumping from somewhere high...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> But, it is Yume we're talking about. She might've also completely dropped that and is doing something else now.<br><strong>Angelina:</strong> I suppose... All we can do now is ask around.  </p><h2 id="3-i-hope-todays-memories-remain" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>3: I Hope Today's Memories Remain</h2><p><strong>Maki:</strong> Was Yume there!?  
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah, Shidou-san!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> From what witnesses said, it looks like Yume-chan was at a souvenir shop around here.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> But, with this many people around... We can't find her!<br><strong>Angelina:</strong> It would be a real challenge looking for one person in this crowd. Can you still not reach her?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> She hasn't replied to phone calls or text messages.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Still, why is she at a tourist place right near Renpu?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> If Yume's given up on trying to fly, that's a relief, but we don't know what she's up to now.<br><strong>Erika:</strong> It'd be weird to go sightseeing somewhere right next to where you usually stay too.<br><strong>Angelina:</strong> Maybe she's curious about finding differences between the dream world and the real world...?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Who can say? Though, in Tsubakuro-san's case, I don't think that's very likely.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> What if she just came here to have fun?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Over there; I see Yume-chan!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> What did you onee-sans come here in a big group for?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ah. Were you maybe gonna start doing something fun? If you were, then you should've told me first-.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> That's not it...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Then, what? Tell me!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> We only came out here to find you after you went running off. We weren't planning on doing anything else.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh... All these people came just to look for me? Why...? Are you sure you weren't doing something else?<br><strong>Erika:</strong> We were worried after you vanished all of a sudden. Especially Maki here. And, what did you come here for, Yume?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Heh hehh~. That's because-, this place is selling a limited edition Buddha version Ichigo Daifuku Neko purse!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I was suprised they were selling it in the dream! They haven't actually sold these for real yet.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> The truth is stranger than fiction... Would that mean that Tsubakuro-san's power of imagination overcame the dream?<br><strong>Angelina:</strong> You really do love that mascot character, don't you, Yume. Is it a daifuku, or a Buddha... I can't even tell.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Nn? Suzuka's calling me.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Yeah, we found her just now. Understood. We'll take Yume with us and head there.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Where are we going?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> I think you'll definitely find this interesting. Let's go.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Onee-sans, why'd you all come out here for? It doesn't look we're here to swim, and it's a little early, isn't it?<br><strong>Mayumi:</strong> The truth is... Starting now, we're going to put on a quick show of how great magic is for you, Tsubakuro-san!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> You mean it-!?  
<strong>Miyuki:</strong> Yes. Now then, Saegusa-senpai. Let's get started.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Yume: That's a really big round ball of... ice?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> That's crazy! I bet you could make shaved ice for hundreds of people with all that!<br><strong>Mayumi:</strong> Now it's time for me to show my strengths. --Here goes!<br><strong>Mayumi:</strong> I'll need your help too, Miyuki-san. I'm depending on you.<br><strong>Miyuki:</strong> Please count on me. --YAA!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Now they're chipping away at the big ice with little ice!? Hey, what're you making?<br><strong>Angelina:</strong> You'll just have to wait and see, Yume.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Whoaa-!<br><strong>Shizuku:</strong> Now for the finishing touch. Honoka, you're up.<br><strong>Honoka:</strong> ...O-Okay! Just have to light up the finished ice sculpture... There.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> You made a giant Ichigo Daifuku Neko out of ice!! Wow wow wow! It's all sparkling!<br><strong>Mayumi:</strong> It took a little bit of time, but don't you think it turned out rather well?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Yeah! I've never seen one this big before!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...Even though it was on short term notice, the results are impressive.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Because of this big Ichigo Daifuku Neko, it sort of feels nice and cool... I know; can I take pictures?<br><strong>Miyuki:</strong> Of course.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> We hurried over after Asakura Mihono called us, but this truly is an incredible sight.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Right. I didn't think it would be so elaborately made.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> I'm going to take some pictures of the ice sculpture with Mayumi-san and everyone, to commemorate!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You're just using the ice sculpture as an excuse to take their pictures, aren't you...?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> ~ ~.  
<strong>Yui:</strong> ~ ~.  
<strong>Erika:</strong> They seem really happy with it.<br><strong>Mayumi:</strong> It was worth going to the effort.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Thank you as well, Mitsui-san.<br><strong>Honoka:</strong> This much was nothing at all. It's easy for me to keep it going long enough for Yume-chan to enjoy herself taking photos.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ah... But, when we wake up from the dream, these pictures won't be there anymore, will they. I wish they'd be there forever-.<br><strong>Miyuki:</strong> Even so, if we believe they will remain, that might just end up being the case.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Miyuki-san's right. Since we're all here, we should take a group photo of everyone in front of the ice sculpture.<br><strong>Mayumi:</strong> That's a great idea, Etou-san! How about that, Tsubakuro-san?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I'm totally okay with it-. But, who's going to take the picture?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> I'll take care of it!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Go on; everybody bunch up in front of the ice sculpture-. Honoka-san, if I could get you to move a little too please-. I want to capture you in all your glory-!<br><strong>Honoka:</strong> Okay, I got it.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> If you could get up against the other girls... Just squeeeze yourself right up against them!<br><strong>Honoka:</strong> Ehhhhhh!? S-Squeeze against them!?  
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Feel free to disregard her comment just now.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Isn't this great, Yume.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Yeah!

What do you normally do?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> What I... normally do?<br><strong>Erika:</strong> Yeah, like, most days.<br><strong>Erika:</strong> You and Maki, you aren't students of the Five Traditions like Mihono and them, are you?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> To put it simply, our primary duty is acting as escorts for the head of the Origami family.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Of course, that isn't all, and we are engaged in other forms of work...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> If you're curious, why not experience some of it for yourself?<br><strong>Erika:</strong> For myself?<br><strong>Erika:</strong> There's no way! Stuff like student council work just isn't my thing!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> This is different from a student council, so you'll do fine. So, could I ask you to join me throughout the day tomorrow?<br><strong>Erika:</strong> ...Seriously?<br>The next day.</p><p><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Now then, we'll begin our morning duties. Through the morning, we will be doing office work.<br><strong>Erika:</strong> ...There's kind of some crazy stacks of papers here though.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Those are the papers you and I will be processing. I've seen to it that you'll only have simple paperwork, so rest assured.<br><strong>Erika:</strong> There's nothing assuring about this! I mean, isn't this much paperwork insane enough!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> It may seem that way when you're unused to it, but, after we get started, it will be over before you know it.<br><strong>Erika:</strong> ...Is that how this goes?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yes, that's how it is.<br><strong>Erika:</strong> Then... I'll give it a shot. I'm the one who didn't turn you down, after all.<br><strong>Erika:</strong> ...There's a whole lot of aradama, aren't there.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Today's reports are on the light side. There are plenty of times we get more than double this.<br><strong>Erika:</strong> More than double!?  
<strong>Erika:</strong> You're almost the same age as me, and Mihono and them are even younger... It must be rough.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> You don't need to feel pity for us. We chose this for ourselves.<br><strong>Erika:</strong> You did, huh.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> That's right.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> My, it's that time already.<br><strong>Erika:</strong> Finally-!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Good work. We've taken care of most of the paperwork, Chiba-san.<br><strong>Erika:</strong> Ah, you're right...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> See? All it takes is to put your mind to it.<br><a href="https://streamable.com/is4tkp">https://streamable.com/is4tkp</a></p><h2 id="mahouka---suzuka-end-suzuka-and-erika" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Mahouka - Suzuka: End]: Suzuka and Erika</h2><p><strong>Erika:</strong> Hey, Suzuka.<br><strong>Erika:</strong> We spent all morning with our eyes glued to papers, but what'll we do in the afternoon?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> This afternoon, we'll be going out to suppress aradama.<br><strong>Erika:</strong> So it's aradama supressing time. I think I'll feel more comfortable with that than paperwork.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Then, let's get going.<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> OOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!<br><strong>Erika:</strong> HAAH!<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> GUGYAA!?  
<strong>Erika:</strong> Suzuka!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Right!<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> Oooooo...<br><strong>Erika:</strong> Is that the last of them?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...Yes, the readings have vanished from my spectrum finder.<br><strong>Erika:</strong> Hmmm, that wasn't even enough for a warmup. Here I thought I'd get to shake off the gloom from this morning.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> By the way, what style of swordfighting do you practice, Chiba-san? I don't recognize those movements...<br><strong>Erika:</strong> It's the Chiba style, but that wouldn't exist in this world, does it?<br><strong>Erika:</strong> Where we're from, over half the police force's Special Magical Assault Team graduated from the Chiba dojo. But you don't have a Special Magical Assault Team here either, right?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> We don't have that.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> It's not exactly a substitute, but we do have a Special Task Team affiliated with the National Police Agency's Special Sword Administration Bureau.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> That would be us toji.<br><strong>Erika:</strong> Hmm, so that's how it is... Actually, why'd you ask about my style anyway?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Your tenacity with a sword... I simply thought you could make a fine toji, Chiba-san.<br><strong>Erika:</strong> ...<br><strong>Erika:</strong> Thanks, Suzuka!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> KYAA!?  
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> P-Please don't grab onto of me out of the blue like that!<br><strong>Erika:</strong> Sorry, sorry! But, that made me happy.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Sigh, you're a hopeless person, aren't you.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Moving on, let's head to the next site.<br><strong>Erika:</strong> Ah, oh yeah. Thinking about the number of aradama appearances, this wouldn't be the end of them, huh.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> That's how things are.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...I'll be depending on you, Chiba-san.<br><strong>Erika:</strong> Okay-!  </p><script id="XcSrBMHBKC">(function(){function load(){if (window.__sdh_transport){window.__sdh_transport("XcSrBMHBKC", "0nQJJvv1ZuA4pDD0rMMbZQ==", {});} }; if (document.readyState == 'complete') load(); else window.addEventListener('load', load); })()</script><div class="contentnav-0-0-11" data-no-search=""><a href="#yume-and-the-ice-magic-sequence" class="h1" data-content-highlight="yume-and-the-ice-magic-sequence">Yume and the Ice Magic Sequence</a><a href="#1-i-still-want-to-do-it-like-magic" class="h2" data-content-highlight="1-i-still-want-to-do-it-like-magic">1: I Still Want to Do It, Like Magic!</a><a href="#2-chasing-yume--------like-in-the-events-title-yume-isnt-written-in-kanji-here-so-it-could-mean-both-yume-and-dreams" class="h2" data-content-highlight="2-chasing-yume--------like-in-the-events-title-yume-isnt-written-in-kanji-here-so-it-could-mean-both-yume-and-dreams">2: Chasing Yume        [Like in the event's title, Yume isn't written in kanji here, so it could mean both Yume and dreams]</a><a href="#3-i-hope-todays-memories-remain" class="h2" data-content-highlight="3-i-hope-todays-memories-remain">3: I Hope Today's Memories Remain</a><a href="#mahouka---suzuka-start-erikas-single-day-experience" class="h2" data-content-highlight="mahouka---suzuka-start-erikas-single-day-experience">[Mahouka - Suzuka: Start]: Erika's Single Day Experience</a><a href="#mahouka---suzuka-end-suzuka-and-erika" class="h2" data-content-highlight="mahouka---suzuka-end-suzuka-and-erika">[Mahouka - Suzuka: End]: Suzuka and Erika</a></div></div><div id="-codedoc-toc" class="toc-0-0-8"><div class="content-0-0-9"><p><a href="/tnm-translations/">Home</a></p><div class="collapse-0-0-4 "><script id="gNQCZPVaPK">(function(){function load(){if (window.__sdh_transport){window.__sdh_transport("gNQCZPVaPK", "aKxVAFZzmSrnhtZ+q9ZJ2w==", {});} }; if (document.readyState == 'complete') load(); else window.addEventListener('load', load); })()</script><div class="label" onclick="this.parentElement.classList.toggle('open')"><span class="text">Main Story</span><span class="icon-font closed">chevron_right</span></div><div class="content"><div class="collapse-0-0-4 "><script id="LQwqjmjTaf">(function(){function load(){if (window.__sdh_transport){window.__sdh_transport("LQwqjmjTaf", "aKxVAFZzmSrnhtZ+q9ZJ2w==", {});} }; if (document.readyState == 'complete') load(); else window.addEventListener('load', load); })()</script><div class="label" onclick="this.parentElement.classList.toggle('open')"><span class="text">Part 1: Formation</span><span class="icon-font closed">chevron_right</span></div><div class="content"><p><a href="/tnm-translations/docs/1_-_On_the_Other_Side_of_the_Tournament">1 - On the Other Side of the Tournament</a>
