News Anchor:</strong> In regards to the strange phenomenon affecting the capital, along with the frequent appearances of aradama, Miss Tagitsuhime, as well as the Sword Administration bureau, have yet to make any statement--<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> What do you think?<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> She abandoned them. Having fully restored herself, Tagitsuhime no longer has any need for Yukina-- for human assistance.<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> She probably never considered... That this was always going to happen.<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> Today makes a week since Tagitsuhime opened the gate to the netherworld...<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> In these circumstances, the toji dispatched by Minoseki and Heijou have been a great help. I have to give my thanks to Ema and Iroha.<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> Of course.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> How are Etou and the others doing?<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> It&#x27;s been as hard on them as you&#x27;d expect. ...Though, since the day after, they&#x27;ve each been working away at aradama suppression missions.<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> The investigation team led by Kitora Mirja is doing the same. I&#x27;m sure they think it&#x27;s the least they can do.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> I see...<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Sana. I want to place you in direct supervision of the investigation team. There&#x27;s something that&#x27;s concerning me.<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> That won&#x27;t be an issue, but... Who will be in charge of the overall situation...?<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> I have someone in mind. She was more stubborn than I imagined. It took great lengths to convince her.<br>
<strong>Yuzuki:</strong> I don&#x27;t want to hear that from you of all people, Yukari.<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> Yuzuki... Senpai...!?<br>
<strong>Yuzuki:</strong> ...Could I ask for your cooperation?<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> How could I say no! The demon that scared even Minato-senpai is back! The demon! The devil! Yuzuki-senpai!<br>
<strong>Yuzuki:</strong> W-Was I that bad...?<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> But wait, if Yuzuki-senpai is going to be in command of all toji, and I&#x27;ll be in direct command of the investigation team, what will you be doing, Yukari-senpai...?<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> ............My mind is settled. I&#x27;m going to bring this to an end. What started twenty years ago.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> It&#x27;s been a while since we all got to gather round and have some of Mai-chan&#x27;s sweets, hasn&#x27;t it! I think I&#x27;ll go with this one!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Wha- this is chocolate mint flavored!? Mm, it&#x27;s actually not bad! I think I understand why Hiyori-chan gets so worked up about it!<br>
<strong>Sayaka/Mai/Ellen:</strong> ............<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Sigh~... Kanami. Do you seriously think we haven&#x27;t noticed?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Huh? Ahh, you mean this other cookie? Ahaha! So you spotted me secretly grabbing two, huh~!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Please, just stop, Kanami-chan...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> We all understand, Kanamin. Just how hard this is for you.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Even I can tell you&#x27;re forcing it, Kanami.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Wh-What do you mean, forcing it...? Come on, guys. Am I really acting that weird?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> You don&#x27;t have to force yourself to smile if you don&#x27;t want to.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> ...I told Hiyori-chan. That it was too much for her on her own, so I&#x27;d carry half of it...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> And still... When it mattered most, I couldn&#x27;t reach her...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I couldn&#x27;t keep my promise either... In the end, Hiyori-chan had to deal with everything by herself... I couldn&#x27;t do anything for her...<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Kanami-chan... We all feel the same way... Okay?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Mai... cha...<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...She&#x27;s right. It&#x27;s the same for us.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> We couldn&#x27;t... Keep our promise.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> I&#x27;m sorry, Kanamin. Something this difficult got forced on you...<br>
<strong>Nene:</strong> Ne...<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> That&#x27;s why... It&#x27;s okay, Kanami-chan. You don&#x27;t have to hold it in anymore...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> ...kay...!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> --I&#x27;ll be fine now. Sorry, that I made everything so difficult.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> It&#x27;s not a problem at all.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm. You&#x27;re the one always helping us.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Then, on top of that, there&#x27;s something I want to ask you.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> If nothing else, I want to get it back... Kogarasumaru. Hiyori-chan&#x27;s okatana.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> President Maniwa. The gate to the netherworld is only getting wider, isn&#x27;t it.<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> That&#x27;s right. We might not have much time left...<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> By the way, you might have already found out, but Ayanokouji Martial Arts School&#x27;s President Souraku has returned to command the situation.<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> And, because of that, I&#x27;ve been given control of your investigation team for the time being.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Yes, I understand.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> So? What&#x27;d you call us here for right after you took charge?<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> Right, about that. I thought Kitora and Musumi would be back by now, but...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Um, before that! How is Yui doing now?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> After she injected herself with that ampoule, we haven&#x27;t heard anything about her... Only that they put her in the hospital...<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> Yamashiro is still undergoing medical treatment. From what the doctors said, she made a remarkably fast recovery, but they still haven&#x27;t approved her release yet.<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> That speedy recovery is probably the effects of the ampoule Yuzuki-senp... Commander Souraku came up with.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Excuse me!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> --Eh-!? Yui!? Are you alright now!?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Yep! I&#x27;m all better!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> --Or I wish I could tell you that, but the doctors said I still shouldn&#x27;t be moving around yet... Ahaha...<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Wait, hang on, you just came running in here now.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> See... I just wanted to see you all so badly, so I went and ignored what the doctors told me! ...Teehee!<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> You&#x27;re a real idiot, aren&#x27;t you?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> ...Please, hear me out, President Maniwa! They keep bringing toji in, all these girls hurt fighting aradama, one after another into the hospital!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> When I saw that... I just! I couldn&#x27;t stay lying around in bed while that went on!<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> You were pretty badly injured yourself, you know...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I&#x27;m fine! Please! Let me come back to the investigation team! Let me go on missions!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="2-kashuu-kiyomitsu-and-the-asakura-family"></a>2: Kashuu Kiyomitsu and the Asakura Family<a class="hash-link" href="#2-kashuu-kiyomitsu-and-the-asakura-family" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Sana:</strong> Let you back into the investigation team? Let you go on missions? You know I&#x27;m not going to allow that!<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> Yamashiro! Didn&#x27;t the doctor tell you you still shouldn&#x27;t be up and about?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> But I can&#x27;t stand the idea of going back to a hospital bed! If you don&#x27;t let me come back, I&#x27;ll follow the investigation team on my own! Stalking is what I&#x27;m best at!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> When she puts it like that, it&#x27;s pretty convincing...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Yui-chan. I understand feeling like you can&#x27;t just sit by, but you need to listen to what the doctors say...<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> I mean, if she&#x27;s saying she&#x27;s fine herself, isn&#x27;t it fine if we let her come with?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> If anything goes wrong, I&#x27;ll put a stop to it real quick.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Kofuki-chan. You can&#x27;t go making wild suggestions like...<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> No really, Chichie. Think about what kinda person she is. Even if we leave her behind, she&#x27;s gonna do everything she can to come after us.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Even if we manage to lose her, she&#x27;s probably just gonna find some other toji to stick to.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Mm... You have a point... Thinking like that, it might be best to have her with us from the start, where we can keep an eye on her so she doesn&#x27;t push herself too hard.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Kofuki-san! You believe in how much I can help, don&#x27;t you! Thank you so much!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I think what Fukki believes in is the dangerous side of your personality...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Still, I agree with Fukki. If Yui says she&#x27;s fine, then I think we should trust her!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Please, I&#x27;ll ask you too! Let Yui back into the investigation team! We&#x27;ll all look after her the best we can!<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> You&#x27;ll all look after her? She&#x27;s not a puppy...<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> ...Sigh. Fine. If you&#x27;re not going to give up on it, I&#x27;ll allow her back into the investigation team, on one condition.<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> If your commanding officer, Kitora, decides you&#x27;re struggling to continue fighting, you&#x27;ll withdraw from the battlefield immediately. Meet that condition and you&#x27;re in. Am I clear?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Yes-! Thank you very much! And thank you too, everyone! I&#x27;ll do everything I can to make up for the trouble I&#x27;ve caused you!<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> It&#x27;s possible Kitora could decide at any point to deny your place on the team. If that happens, be sure to do as she says.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Wait... Come to think of it, why haven&#x27;t I seen Mirja-san&#x27;s gorgeous self or Kiyoka-chan&#x27;s lovable self?<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> That&#x27;s because, on Kitora&#x27;s proposal, the two have been taking care of something...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Kitora Mirja and Musumi Kiyoka have made their return.<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> Kitora, Musumi, good work you two. You came at just the right time.<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> Ah, Shichinosato. This is the reason I called you all here.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Nn...? What&#x27;s that supposed to mean?<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> Kitora and Musumi were sent out to Kamakura to look through an archive of the Sword Administration Bureau&#x27;s records.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> The Sword Administration Bureau&#x27;s...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Records...?<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> So then, Kitora, Musumi. Did you find anything?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Yes! We found it!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I had arranged for the details to be organized in a separate file and transported here... Do you mind if I speak about our findings for now?<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> Go ahead. That&#x27;d save us some time.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> In our investigation into the relationship between Kashuu Kiyomtisu and the Asakura lineage, as I suspected, we found a record of an ancestor of Asakura Mihono using Kashuu Kiyomitsu to seal a great aradama in the netherworld.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Though, to be more precise, it is specifically because of its lethal status as a great aradama sealing okatana that it was handed down through the Asakura family for generations, and is currently in Asakura Mihono&#x27;s possession... Or so I believe.<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> Then, to sum it all up...<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> Kashuu Kiyomitsu, like Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu, could exist in both the netherworld and our world, and potentially strike a fatal blow to Tagitsuhime.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="3-commence-operation-1"></a>3: Commence Operation!

<strong>Kanami:</strong> Yes! At the very least, so we can get Kogarasumaru... Please let me get Hiyori-chan&#x27;s okatana back!<br>
<strong>Yuzuki:</strong> I see. And do the other four of you agree on this?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I do!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Please let us go with her.<br>

<strong>Nene:</strong> Nene-!<br>
<strong>Yuzuki:</strong> ...Fine then. I&#x27;ll approve your request to sortie. But only provided you do whatever it takes to make it back to us.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> It&#x27;s no fair that Chidori-onee-san gets to do everything! President Souraku, let us go sortie too! I want to save Yomi-onee-san!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yume has the right idea. So long as the possibility exists, we can&#x27;t give up on her.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ...Commander Souraku. We wish to sortie too.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> We have to be there for Yomi-- for our comrade, if at all possible.<br>
<strong>Yuzuki:</strong> ...I understand. But only on the condition that you suppress any aradama you encounter at ground level.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Yes ma&#x27;am! Thank you very much!<br>

<strong>Yukari:</strong> Now-- Commence the operation!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="5-kashuu-kiyomitsus-potential-1"></a>5: Kashuu Kiyomitsu&#x27;s Potential (1)<a class="hash-link" href="#5-kashuu-kiyomitsus-potential-1" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Chie:</strong> Kashuu Kiyomitsu could fatally damage Tagitsuhime...? Do we know that for sure...?<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> Let me repeat, it could potentially do that. The Sword Administration Bureau currently doesn&#x27;t place that level of importance on Kashuu Kiyomitsu either.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> However, there is something that caught my interest. The other day, when Asakura Mihono suppressed that great aradama, Tagitsuhime suddenly arrived.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> It may be possible that she was sensing the potential threat that Kashuu Kiyomitsu posed.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> But, she left again without doing anything about Kashuu Kiyomitsu.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Don&#x27;t you think that, if Tagitsuhime was fine with leaving Kashuu Kiyomitsu alone, she decided it couldn&#x27;t be any danger to her...?<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> Hm... At any rate, with just what we know now, we can&#x27;t say anything conclusively...<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> That means there&#x27;s nothing to do but cut Tagitsuhime and see what happens.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Nice thinking, Kofuki-san! It&#x27;s so simple it&#x27;s scary!<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> It might be simple, but there&#x27;s a point to it.<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> On top of that, whether or not Kashuu Kiyomitsu has some special effectiveness against Tagitsuhime, if you girls were to sortie, it would make things a whole lot easier for Etou and the rest.<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> ...Asakura, what do you think?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> --I want to find out. Whether or not Kiyomitsu can defeat Tagitsuhime.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> And more than that, if Kanami is fighting Tagitsuhime, I can&#x27;t stay here doing nothing.<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> Guess there was no point in asking. In that case, I&#x27;ll get authorization from Commander Souraku to let you sortie with Etou&#x27;s unit.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I won&#x27;t let you down!<br>
<strong>Yuzuki:</strong> So you were in here, Sana.<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> Commander Souraku, I was just about to come get you. Did you need something from me?<br>
<strong>Yuzuki:</strong> Just now, I sent Yukari along with Etou Kanami and her unit after Tagitsuhime. Along with them, the three elite guards were sent to search after Yomi.<br>
<strong>Yuzuki:</strong> With the lack of available toji, the defense of the nearby area has gotten thinner. I was wondering, if the investigation team is free at the moment, could I ask them to help--<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ehh-!? Kanami and them just left!? We&#x27;re already one step behind-!<br>
<strong>Yuzuki:</strong> ...? Did something happen?<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> I can explain why later, but these girls want to go after Tagitsuhime too.<br>
<strong>Yuzuki:</strong> Are you serious about this...?<br>
<strong>Yuzuki:</strong> I understand; I&#x27;ll approve it. I&#x27;ll find someone else to handle defense of the area. ...I&#x27;m counting on you, Kitora.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I won&#x27;t let you down!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Umm, hey... Everyone? I just can&#x27;t stop thinking, I have to apologize to you, to make things right...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I&#x27;m sorry for what I did!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> You all went out of your way to accept me into the team, and... I can&#x27;t believe I used my okatana against you!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> When I think about it now, I don&#x27;t know why I acted like that, like it was normal... I can&#x27;t get it out of my head...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I&#x27;m just really sorry...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Yui... We get it! It&#x27;s all okay now!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Everyone here understands just what sort of effect that brainwashing had. By no means was it your fault.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Yui-chan, nobody blames you for anything.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Yeah, so quit acting all serious. Just go back to your usual self.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> More than anything, I&#x27;m just so happy we were able to get you back.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> You all... Thanks...<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Still, I&#x27;m surprised Mirja let Yui come with us just like that. I was sure she&#x27;d put her foot down harder.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Setouchi Chie stated it as, &quot;that way we can keep an eye on her, to stop her from acting recklessly,&quot; didn&#x27;t she? I agree with that point of view.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> However, Yamashiro Yui. If you do behave recklessly, I will order you to retreat on the spot. If I determine you are unable to continue fighting, I will make the same order. Please do not forget that.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I won&#x27;t!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> With that settled, let&#x27;s get moving!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Wait, look at that!<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> GGGGAAAAAAAA!!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Now&#x27;s a good time to test out my strength! Just watch how much I can do!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> But don&#x27;t push yourself too hard, okay, Yui!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="6-kashuu-kiyomitsus-potential-2"></a>6: Kashuu Kiyomitsu&#x27;s Potential (2)<a class="hash-link" href="#6-kashuu-kiyomitsus-potential-2" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I was worried, after Yui-chan had to stop by the doctor, but...  It looks like we don&#x27;t have to worry about her now.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Mmhm! I guess modern medicine just couldn&#x27;t compare to my love for Kiyoka-chan!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I don&#x27;t really understand what she&#x27;s saying though...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Yamashiro Yui being able to move without difficulty is possibly an effect of the strengthening drug used by the elite guard.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Yeah! I feel just great! I&#x27;m not getting slowed down a bit!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Still, be sure you don&#x27;t do anything to force yourself. I agree with Mirja: &quot;if you behave recklessly, you&#x27;ll retreat on the spot.&quot;<br>

<strong>Mirja:</strong> Our only option now is to make every effort believing that&#x27;s the case.<br>

Why is there such a difference in power between you and us...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I got to use something special on myself. But, just between you and me, the side effects are seriously messing me up. I can&#x27;t tell you how bad this thirst is, but it&#x27;s taking everything I&#x27;ve got to fight it.<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> ...Yui, why&#x27;d you betray us? Don&#x27;t you want to see the ideal world Tagitsuhime-sama is creating?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ideal world? This here is what Tagitsuhime created by opening the gate to the netherworld.<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> It&#x27;s a necessary sacrifice to create her paradise.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> That&#x27;s just selfish reasoning. When I became a toji, I did it to protect Miku.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> --Ah, Miku, my little sister who&#x27;s beyond cute, she caught this kind of complicated disease, so ever since she was little, she&#x27;s been in the hospital.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Miku loves to study, so there&#x27;s always piles of heavy books in her hospital room. Her dream is to be a schoolteacher someday.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> If Miku were healthy, she could easily make that dream a reality.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> --But her sickness took all her possibilities away from her.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I might not be able to cure Miku, but so long as I&#x27;m a toji, I can afford to get Miku the best treatment she can have. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m a toji.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> A world that treats Miku... The person I&#x27;m fighting to protect! Like a sacrifice! There&#x27;s no way that could be a paradise!<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> What are you losing your nerve for now...!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> If we defeat Tagitsuhime, your brainwashing should be broken too. Then I think you&#x27;ll understand what I&#x27;m telling you.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I&#x27;m not losing my nerve at all. This is what matters most to me. So, until then-- please rest.<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> Urgh...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> --Now then. Honestly, I&#x27;ve been fighting pretty hard to keep going, it hurts like crazy all over, and I think I&#x27;ve got a fever. But, I&#x27;ll power through it somehow!<br>
<strong>Other:</strong> 1 Lost in Action<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> There&#x27;s nothing abnormal in the vital signs of all the toji sortieing right now.<br>
<strong>Yuzuki:</strong> No one&#x27;s been seriously injured then. They&#x27;re doing well for themselves out there.<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> They are. Makes me wish my younger self could&#x27;ve learned a thing or two from them.<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> Though, this is all because...<br>
<strong>Yuzuki:</strong> I know. Juujou Hiyori, 1 toji lost in action... That&#x27;s a heavy figure.<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> We can&#x27;t let that number grow any higher. We have to get them all the logistical support we can give.<br>
<strong>Yuzuki:</strong> Still, times will come that we have to prepare ourselves for. For those times... That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m ready to be commander for.<br>
