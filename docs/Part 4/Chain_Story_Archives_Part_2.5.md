## 1: The Investigation Team, Dissolved
Not long after Tagitsuhime, fleeing to the netherworld, spread aradama-- special hazardous waste across the entirety of Kanto.

  
**Mihono:** Excuse me.  
**Hashima Ema:** I'm sorry to call you in here when you're so busy with your duties.  
**Ema:** I wanted to speak with you about what you'll be doing from here on out, Asakura-san.  
**Mihono:** ...From here on out?  
**Ema:** You don't have to look so anxious. You understand what the state of things is like now, don't you?  
**Ema:** The entire country, not only Kanto, has seen a rise in the frequency of aradama appearances. And not a day goes by without debate over Kamakura's special hazardous waste leakage issue being broadcast on television.  
**Ema:** They're going to be airing Akane-sama's hearing very soon too.  
**Mihono:** ...I know. Nothing's like it used to be.  
**Mihono:** There weren't this many aradama before, and the STT didn't spend this much time busy with missions.  
**Mihono:** Everyone from the investigation team never even gets to see each other anymore...  
**Ema:** About the investigation team, its activities are going to be suspended.  
**Mihono:** There's not going to be an investigation team anymore!?  
**Ema:** It shouldn't go away just yet.  
**Ema:** But, at least until the special hazardous waste problem is settled, you all won't be taking any action as part of the investigation team.  
**Mihono:** ...Then, when you said we'd talk about what I'll be doing from now on, do you mean you're putting me in some other unit?  
**Ema:** Asakura-san. There are two options available for you now.  
**Ema:** The first is to be part of a unit under the Five Traditions, working with the Special Task Team.  
**Ema:** The other is to become a provisional member of a unit under command of the Metropolitan Police Department. It will be difficult, but I think it would be a good experience for you.  
**Mihono:** Umm, when you say the Five Traditions, do you mean Minoseki?  
**Ema:** You wouldn't be wrong to think that.  
**Ema:** You might be relocated elsewhere... say, to Renpu, but you'll primarily be working with Minoseki.  
**Mihono:** ...That might be better then?  
**Mihono:** Though, would I know anyone who's working with the MPD?  
**Ema:** Of course. There are others loaned to them, some who you should be familiar with... Let's see, Suzumoto-san and Yamashiro-san should have transferred there.  
**Mihono:** Suzumoto-san and Yamashiro-san did...?  
**Mihono:** (Uuu... I don't know. I never did get their phone numbers, so maybe I should go there?)  
**Mihono:** (But, if I get transferred, I don't really know what' I'd be doing. I feel like I'd get to be more useful working here with Mai and the others.)  
**Mihono:** (Yeah, I'll go with that. I'll get their phone numbers sooner or later, I know it!)  
**Mihono:** ...Okay, I've made up my mind, President Hashima. I'm going to work hard here helping the STT.  
**Ema:** ...That's fine.  
**Ema:** You'll be part of one of Minoseki's units, Asakura-san. Though, the offer to transfer to the MPD will always be available, so if you ever change your mind, come right here and tell me.  
**Mihono:** Okay!  
**Mihono:** HAAAAAAAAAAAA!!  
**Nagae Futaba:** Wha, Mihono!?  
**Mihono:** We have to focus, Futaba! Let's take care of the aradama first! We can talk later!  
**Futaba:** R-Right!  
**Futaba:** (I just went along with her, but... Is it me, or did Mihono get a heck of a lot stronger!?)  
**Futaba:** (I remember Mihono being a lot more... Did something happen to her when she was with the investigation team?)  
**Fukuda Sawano:** ...  
**Sawano:** (...It's only natural Nagae-san would be surprised. Compared to how she was during the tournament qualifiers... Asakura-san is fighting like a completely different person.)  
**Sawano:** (Working with the investigation team should have benefited her, but... Would it have made this much of a difference?)  
**Sawano:** ...Asakura-san! Can you take care of things here? I'll go support the other units!  
**Mihono:** Sure, just leave it to me!  
**Futaba:** Sawano-san, what should I do!  
**Sawano:** ...Please come with me, Nagae-san! Asakura-san can handle herself here!  
**Futaba:** ...Okay!  
**Futaba:** (The way I am now, I'd just be weighing Mihono down... It's so frustrating! It wasn't that long ago that I could fight neck and neck with her!)  
**Mihono:** HAAA!!  
**Aradama:** GGGOOOOUUU!!  
**Mihono:** Grr, it's fast...  
**Mihono:** But still! I was working hard with the investigation team... So if I just calm down, I can do this!  
**Mihono:** Alright! Now for the next one!  
**Futaba:** ...Keep it up, Mihono!  
**Futaba:** (You'll see, I'll be right there fighting alongside you again soon!)  
**Mihono:** Pant... Pant...  
**Toji A:** KYAAAAA!!  
**Mihono:** -!? Are you okay!?  
**Sawano:** Don't lose your focus! Help is already on the way!  
**Mihono:** R-Right!  
**Sawano:** Those who can't apply utsushi, help move the injured away from here! Nagae-san, keep them safe!  
**Futaba:** On it!  
**Mihono:** Sawano-san and Futaba can take care of things there! I have to... Defend this place no matter what!  
**Aradama:** GYUUUUOOOO!!  
**Man:** Whoa-!? S-Somebody help meee!!  
**Mihono:** -!? --Jin'i!!  
**Mihono:** Are you alright!?  
**Man:** Why the hell would I be alright!? Do something about that monster already!  
**Mihono:** O-Okay!  
**Mihono:** HAAAAAAAAA!!  
**Mihono:** Now's your chance, please get away to safety!  
**Man:** Get away to safety?  
**Man:** I never got attacked by aradama before... Before you toji screwed everything up!  
**Mihono:** ...!  
**Mihono:** S-Sorry...  
**Man:** Goddammit, why did this happen to me...! You're supposed to show up before anyone gets hurt!  
**Mihono:** (We're doing the best we can to fight... So why...)  
**Futaba:** Mihono-, great work back there-.  
**Mihono:** ...Yeah, you too, Futaba.  
**Futaba:** ? You look kinda down; did something happen?  
**Mihono:** ...Nah, it's nothing!  
**Mihono:** I think I'm just a little worn out after how rough things got back there. Let's get back to school quick!  
**Futaba:** Anyway, is it me, or did you seriously get way stronger, Mihono? What kind of training did you do? Did you hide away in the mountains or something!?  
**Mihono:** It wasn't like that-.  

## 2: Outbreak of a Large Scale Aradama Disaster
**Announcement:** A large scale aradama disaster has occurred. The toji on loan from the Five Traditions should prepare to sortie at once.  
**Announcement:** I repeat--  
**Hana:** We only just got transferred here, and we've already got a hard job to do.  
**Yui:** How bad do you think it's going to be? Hopefully it'll be like, "They made it sound so much worse!", but...  
**Hana:** I feel the same, Yui. That's all we can hope for.  
**Hana:** Looks like they sent the info to our phones.  
**Hana:** ...!  
**Yui:** The affected area is an entire district...  
**Hana:** We're responsible for a shopping mall?  
**Yui:** A shopping mall; that's pretty big, isn't it...  
**Hana:** At the bare minimum... There could be several thousand shoppers there now.  
**Yui:** Several thousand!? How is our unit supposed to take care of all those people on our own!?  
**Hana:** Let's calm down.  
**Hana:** ...I think the MPD will have figured the same thing. I wouldn't be surprised if they're calling the Five Traditions for backup right now.  
**Hana:** More importantly... Every moment we spend here, the number of victims is getting bigger.  
**Hana:** We have to go now.  
**Yui:** Right!  
**Man:** (I never got attacked by aradama before... Before you toji screwed everything up!)  
**Mihono:** ...We screwed everything up?  
**Mihono:** I couldn't tell him no... I mean, after what happened with Tagitsuhime...  
**Mihono:** ............  
**Mihono:** ......This isn't helping! Sitting around like this isn't how I do things!  
**Mihono:** I'm going to go ask the president to send me on more missions!  
**Mihono:** Excuse m...  
**Ema:** A large scale aradama disaster?  
**Ema:** You're right, that location is right on our doorstep, however... We don't have toji available that quickly.  
**Ema:** Yes, we need time to organize a unit, and.... Eh? I understand that, but...  
**Mihono:** (Large scale aradama disaster...?)  
**Ema:** Then let's see... I'll need an hour at the least, before they can arrive there...  
**Mihono:** (An hour... By the time an hour passes, how many people will get hurt...)  
**Mihono:** President Hashima, please let me go there!  
**Ema:** Asakura-san!?  
**Ema:** ...I don't have many, but I'll send out the toji who are ready at once. Prevent any casualties as best you can until our units arrive.  
**Ema:** Are there any areas that are most threatened? ...Yes... Alright... Understood.  
**Ema:** Asakura-san, you heard what we were discussing, didn't you?  
**Mihono:** I did! Where should I go?  
**Ema:** I want you to go straight to the shopping mall. You're to join forces with Suzumoto-san and Yamashiro-san there.  
**Mihono:** Suzumoto-san and Yamashiro-san!?  
**Mihono:** (Suzumoto-san and Yamashiro-san are already helping at the mall...)  
**Mihono:** (Come to think of it... Why did those two agree to transfer to the MPD anyway?)  
**Ema:** Do you understand? Rather than suppressing aradama, saving lives is your top priority. Think only about keeping casualties to a minimum.  
**Mihono:** Got it!  
**Mai:** Mihono-chan!  
**Mai:** There was a large scale aradama outbreak! They're organizing units, so we should go!  
**Mihono:** Yeah, I know about it!  
**Mai:** Eh?  
**Mihono:** Just now, they called President Hashima for help with it. So I'm... I'm going on ahead!  
**Mai:** Be careful, Mihono-chan!  
**Mihono:** I will!  

## 3: At the Site
**Ema:** I want units sent to the three areas under the greatest threat!  
**Ema:** Gather Inago Akira, Fukuda Sawano, and Yanase Mai! Organize each of them a unit as fast as you can!  
**Minoseki Instructor:** President Hashima, Inago Akira still hasn't come to school.  
**Ema:** Then find someone else with leadership experience. I'm going to try getting ahold of Inago-san.  
**Inago Akira:** ~~~~~!  
**Akira:** C'mon, I was just getting in a good mood here. ...Huh? President Hashima?  
**Akira:** What's up? It's Inago Akira.  
**Ema:** Inago-san? Where are you right now?  
**Akira:** Just cruising 'round near school; you need something?  
**Ema:** There's been a large scale aradama disaster. I wanted you to be in charge of one of the units responding, however...  
**Akira:** Since you're not waiting for me to get back, it must've really gone to hell, huh.  
**Ema:** I would appreciate it if you would return right away...  
**Akira:** Hey-, you know it wouldn't be me if I came back so fast.  
**Ema:** Really now, don't admit that about yourself.  
**Ema:** Inago-san, I need for you to go to the shopping mall. I just allowed one of the middle school toji to leave for there in advance.  
**Akira:** She's got guts. What's her name?  
**Ema:** Asakura Mihono-san. She made it rather far in the qualifiers for this year's tournament...  
**Akira:** ......Asakura Mihono, huh. Yeah yeah, I know her.  
**Akira:** Alright, I'll be there before you know it.  
**Akira:** First though...  
**Akira:** Ah, you there? That mall right next to Minoseki... Oh, you heard already?  
**Akira:** Yeah yeah... Anyway, it sounds like Asakura Mihono'll be there, so I'm going to go see for myself.  
**Akira:** Alright, time to floor it!  
**Toji A:** The insertion team has returned! Many people are injured!  
**Toji B:** The civilians take priority! Any toji who can no longer fight, fall to the rear!  
**Toji A:** Roger!  
**Citizen A:** My friend is still inside there! You have to hurry and rescue them!  
**Toji B:** You don't have to worry. They're working right now to rescue everyone they can...  
**Citizen B:** Give it a rest! Instead of making excuses, why don't you get in there and save them! That's what you get paid for, isn't it!?  
**Mihono:** ...This is awful.  
**Mihono:** (Ordinary people... And toji too. There's so many of them getting hurt...)  
**Citizen C:** I saw all about it on TV! It's because of their negligence that the aradama came spreading everywhere!!  
**Mihono:** ...!  
**Mihono:** (Because we defeated Tagitsuhime... Was it wrong for us to do that...?)  
**Mihono:** ...I'm a toji from Minoseki, here to help. Where are Suzumoto-san and Yamashiro-san at?  
**Toji A:** If you want Suzumoto-san, she came out with us just now. She should be...  
**Hana:** Asakura-san?  
**Mihono:** Suzumoto-san! Thank goodness I found you! President Hashima told me to meet up with you.  
**Hana:** President Hashima did...? That'll help a lot.  
**Mihono:** Where's Yamashiro-san?  
**Hana:** She's still fighting inside.  
**Hana:** We couldn't rescue all the people at once... So we're trading off leading the people we have saved outside.  
**Mihono:** In that case, we should hurry in there!  
**Hana:** ...  
**Mihono:** Suzumoto-san? Are you feeling tired?  
**Hana:** I am, but... I'm glad you're here, Asakura-san.  
**Mihono:** Ehh!? I haven't done anything yet...?  
**Hana:** Having someone as straightforward and positive as you around makes me feel like I can keep going.  
**Hana:** The situation is awful, but it's reassuring having you here. So much so that I wish you'd gone to the MPD.  
**Mihono:** That's...  
**Hana:** You don't sound interested in it. But, I'd be happy if you at least thought it over while we deal with this incident.  
**Hana:** That said, this is also our first incident right after we transferred.  
**Mihono:** It is?  
**Hana:** That's right.  
**Mihono:** It must be hard on you, having to start with something like this.  
**Hana:** That's for sure; I'm worried about where things are going at this rate. But... I'm glad I decided to transfer.  
**Mihono:** ...Huh? Shouldn't it be the other way around?  
**Hana:** Should it?  
**Hana:** I am feeling nervous, about getting thrown straight into this, and whether I'll be able to keep up if it's nothing but cases like this in the future...  
**Hana:** But I know for a fact that I'll get to protect a lot of people. I'm not going to regret that.  
**Mihono:** (Protect a lot of people... Suzumoto-san put lot of thought into deciding to transfer, unlike me...)  
**???:** KYAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!  
**Hana:** ...! That scream came from...  
**Mihono:** Let's go, Suzumoto-san!

## 4: An Atmosphere of Unrest
**Akira:** Seriously? People won't stop calling today... Tch, and it just had to be these assholes.  
**Akira:** Yeah?  
**???:** If you're entering the large scale aradama outbreak, you are to gather as much noro from it as possible.  
**Akira:** Huhh? Have you lost your damn mind? Try getting your priorities straight here!  
**???:** For that person's desire to be realized, a great amount of noro is needed.  
**???:** Inago Akira, you do understand, don't you?  
**Akira:** You sure love running your mouth, huh. You think naming them would make me do whatever you say?  
**???:** Everything is to fulfill that desire. It isn't as if I'm telling you to ignore the aradama, you know.  
**???:** Suppress the aradama, retrieve their noro, and... Keep an eye on the girl. You can do that, can't you?  
**Akira:** ...  
**Akira:** Yeah, sure, I got it! While I'm suppressing the aradama, I'll get you some noro!  
**Akira:** That good enough for you!?  
**???:** We have high expectations.  
**Akira:** FUCK!  
**Akira:** ...Sigh.  
**Akira:** Ahh, feels a little better letting it out like that! Damnit, this is starting to get on my nerves.  
**Toji A:** Defend this position, no matter what!  
**Tojis:** Right!  
**Mihono:** There's this many aradama!?  
**Hana:** It's like this everywhere inside. We keep killing them and killing them... And more aradama appear.  
**Hana:** That's why we left our unit at a key location and went to secure an escape route.  
**Mihono:** ...  
**Hana:** Looking at it the other way, they can't move from there. So we have to force our way in.  
**Mihono:** Okay!  
**???:** No! Stay away!  
**Mihono:** Suzumoto-san, someone's calling for help!  
**Hana:** ...That way, huh. Let's hurry, Asakura-san!  
**Mihono:** There she is!  
**Hana:** HAAAAAA!!  
**Woman:** ...  
**Mihono:** Are you okay!?  
**Hana:** Don't move her!  
**Hana:** ...There's no injury on her head, and she doesn't seem badly hurt... Alright, she only lost consciousness is all.  
**Hana:** It should be okay if we wake her up.  
**Mihono:** H-Hang on a minute!  
**Hana:** What is it?  
**Mihono:** Ah, uh, it's just...  
**Mihono:** (What if she starts acting the same as the people outside...)  
**Mihono:** I think she was really scared of getting attacked by aradama... Wouldn't it be better if we let her stay asleep?  
**Hana:** You have a point there.  
**Mihono:** ...What's most important for us now is finding Yamashiro-san. I'll look to see if there's someone else around who can help her.  
**Hana:** I'm counting on you.  
**Hana:** I didn't expect that from you back there.  
**Mihono:** Huh?  
**Hana:** I was sure you'd offer to go and bring her outside yourself.  
**Mihono:** Should I have?  
**Hana:** No, it's good you didn't let your emotions get the better of you. You're right that we should focus on meeting up with Yui first.  
**Mihono:** (Didn't let my emotions get the better of me? I did though...)  
**Mihono:** Suzumoto-san!  
**Hana:** Stay quiet... We can let this aradama go.  
**Mihono:** Aren't we going to beat it?  
**Hana:** Our number one priority is rescuing the people here. I know it sounds bad, but... Stopping the aradama comes second.  
**Hana:** Good, it doesn't seem like it's noticed us.  
**Mihono:** ...  
**Hana:** Feeling frustrated?  
**Mihono:** That's not it; there's just something on my mind... Um, can I ask you something?  
**Hana:** What's that?  
**Mihono:** Suzumoto-san, why did you choose to be transferred?  
**Hana:** Why?  
**Mihono:** My school's president asked me too; if I wanted to transfer.  
**Mihono:** But back then, I told her no.  
**Hana:** President Hashima must have high hopes for you, Asakura-san.  
**Mihono:** She does...?  
**Hana:** Yeah. It's very hard working here, so they'd never recommend a toji without the strength to back it up.  
**Mihono:** Ah...  
**Hana:** Are you getting interested?  
**Hana:** When I decided to transfer, I was thinking about the future. I wanted to build up a connection with the police.  
**Mihono:** Suzumoto-san... You're so mature.  
**Hana:** You think so?  
**???:** HAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!  
**Mihono:** That voice was... Yamashiro-san!  

## 5: At a Crossroads
**Aradama:** OOOOOOOOUUUUU!!  
**Yui:** Whagh!  
**Yui:** That's it for my utsushi... But, I'm not done yet!  
**Yui:** HAAAAAAAAAAA!!  
**Yui:** Pant... Pant...  
**Man A:** H-Hey, are you doing okay?  
**Yui:** I'm fine, it's fine, this is a walk in the park!  
**Yui:** ...ah, whoops.  
**Man A:** Look at you, you can barely stand up straight!  
**Yui:** Ahaha, I think I'm just getting a little hungry.  
**Man A:** Why don't you rest for a while?  
**Yui:** When Hana-san gets back, I'll take a break. Don't worry, she'll be back any minute now.  
**Man A:** Still...  
**Hana:** Yui!  
**Man A:** It's that girl from before, and she brought help! Good, now you can get some rest.  
**Yui:** Ooh! And she's a cutie too... Wait, that's Mihono-chan!  
**Hana:** Mihono-chan? Yui, since when have you and Asakura-san been on a first name basis?  
**Yui:** Never, but I'm in the camp that believes in calling cute girls by their first name!  
**Hana:** I figured... Sorry about her, Asakura-san.  
**Mihono:** Ahaha, I'm totally okay with it! I'll call you Yui too then.  
**Yui:** Thanks, Mihono-chan! I feel like I could fight for another five hours now.  
**Hana:** Five hours? You're keeping it realistic, huh.  
**Man B:** What are you standing around gossiping for!? If you've got more toji, then start getting us out of here!  
**Mihono:** -!  
**Mihono:** (They're like this here too...)  
**Man A:** Don't talk to them like that! These girls are risking their lives fighting for us!  
**Woman:** You shouldn't pay him any mind. Thank you, for coming all this way... Really, truly, thank you...  
**Woman:** It was horrible... So many times, I thought it was all over...  
**Mihono:** Ah...  
**Mihono:** ...You don't have to worry! We'll keep you all safe, no matter what!  
**Yui:** Then, let's get to it... whoops.  
**Hana:** Don't overdo it, Yui. Asakura-san and I will keep guard, so you can take a quick break.  
**Yui:** Ugh, sorry. I'll do that.  
**Hana:** Oh, right.  
**Hana:** Do you mind if I ask why you decided to transfer, Yui?  
**Yui:** Where's this coming from? Could it be, you're just so interested in me you can't help it!?  
**Hana:** Asakura-san asked me about it before. Now seemed like a good time, so I figured I'd ask you too.  
**Mihono:** Thanks, Suzumoto-san.  
**Yui:** Does that mean you're joining us, Mihono-chan?  
**Mihono:** Uhh, I'm considering it... After seeing things here, I started feeling sort of conflicted, I guess?  
**Yui:** I see, so there's a chance, huh.  
**Yui:** Hmm, okay. I guess I did it for the money? See, if you get loaned to the police, they start paying you a bit more.  
**Mihono:** ...I kind of wasn't expecting that from you.  
**Yui:** Fu fu fu, at Ayanokouji, they don't call me "the girl you never see coming" for nothing!  
**Hana:** Did that help you any?  
**Mihono:** Yeah. I can tell you and Yui both put a lot of thought into why you transferred.  
**Mihono:** And I...  
**Mihono:** (All I thought about was whether I'd stay with everyone. I should really... Think about it harder now.)  
**Mihono:** What was that sound!?  
**Hana:** It sounded like glass breaking, but... It's sort of unsettling not knowing what happened.  
**Mihono:** I'll go check it out then! Suzumoto-san and Yui-san, you stay here!  
**???:** ORA!  
**Mihono:** (Somebody's fighting?)  
**Mihono:** (The broken glass... Is that a motorcycle? Did the motorcycle come crashing through?)  
**Mihono:** (But why in here...?)  
**???:** C'mon, I don't have time for you small fry. Quit swarming me, damnit.  
**Mihono:** (She's backup? She's wearing a Minoseki uniform, but... I've never seen her before.)  
**???:** Finally...  
**Mihono:** (!? She's collecting the noro? Why is she doing that now, like she's hiding it...)  
**Mihono:** That's enough!  
**???:** Huh?  
**Mihono:** I'm Asakura Mihono, second year at Minoseki Academy's middle school division! What are you doing out here?  
**???:** ...Asakura Mihono.  
**???:** ('Course she'd be suspicious of a toji acting on their own in a place like this.)  
**???:** (Wasn't planning on making contact yet, but... Can't exactly explain what I was doing with the noro to her...)  
**Mihono:** ...  
**???:** (Kashuu Kiyomitsu... It really is broken.)  
**???:** (Or, well...)  
**???:** You've gotta lot of nerve, don'tcha? Just gonna point your okatana at your senpai like that? Huhh?  
**Mihono:** ...First, just answer me this. What are you doing here?  
**???:** First, gimme an apology for pulling your okatana on me. I'm your senpai, y'know?  
**Mihono:** ...  
**???:** ...You asked for it.  
**???:** (For starters, I'll knock some sense into this bratty kouhai of mine! I can come up with something after!)  

## 6: Evaluation
**Mihono:** ...  
**Mihono:** (This girl, she was collecting noro in secret...)  
**Mihono:** (The head of the Origami family was doing the same thing, when she was possessed by Tagitsuhime...)  
**Mihono:** (Whatever her reason, I'd better stop her!)  
**???:** It's not in me to waste breath arguing.  
**???:** Let's go.  
**Mihono:** -!?  
**Mihono:** (That was so fast... And she hits hard too!)  
**???:** HAAA!!  
**Mihono:** Grh!  
**Mihono:** (She's... Really strong!)  
**???:** (...She's got some muscle. But, eh, that's how it is.)  
**???:** ...Alright, I get the gist of it.  
**Mihono:** Of what?  
**???:** (Can't go wasting much time here in these circumstances.)  
**???:** Just say goodnight for now!  
**Mihono:** ...!!  
**Mihono:** ...  
**???:** Man, what're they teaching in the middle school these days? Don't go turning your okatana on your senpai like that.  
**???:** ...Well, actually, I guess it was my fault this time.  
**Yui:** Mihono-chan!  
**???:** Huh?  
**Yui:** GET AWAY FROM MIHONO-CHAAAAAAN!  
**???:** Thought you'd get me by surprise!? Too bad; I'm used to that!!  
**Yui:** Gh...  
**???:** What was with her?  
**Hana:** ...What do you think you're doing, Inago-san?  
**Akira:** Me? She's the one who jumped me. Wait, do I know you?  
**Hana:** Suzumoto Hana. I've seen you a few times through Mokusa.  
**Akira:** ...Ohh, you're with Mokusa too. That's perfect.  
**Akira:** I'm juggling what Mokusa and President Hashima want from me. Things've been getting annoying, so I was going it alone, and this one spotted me.  
**Hana:** ...Is that how it went.  
**Hana:** (President Hashima likely told her to do the same thing she told Mihono... So what did Mokusa want her to do?)  
**Hana:** (Well, she probably wouldn't give me an answer even if I asked.)  
**Akira:** That's my story, so when they wake up, I'm counting on you to help explain.  
**Hana:** Please try explaining things yourself before you get into a fight...  
**Akira:** Hey, they're the ones pointing their okatana at me?  
**Akira:** If someone tries putting me down, I'll make them regret it.  
**Hana:** Anyway, that's Inago Akira-san.  
**Akira:** I'm Inago Akira. Good to meet you.  
**Akira:** Sorry about before; I just took you out on reflex.  
**Yui:** No, don't worry about it! More importantly... Can I call you Boss!?  
**Akira:** Sure, call me whatever.  
**Yui:** Will do!  
**Akira:** And, I didn't mean for things to get out of hand before, Mihono. I lost my cool and wasn't thinking straight.  
**Mihono:** No, I shouldn't have taken out my okatana before I even asked you anything.  
**Mihono:** Though, if President Hashima sent you, you should've said so sooner.  
**Akira:** My bad, but President Hashima didn't tell me anything more than to head over here.  
**Akira:** So, to make it up to you, let me help you guys out.  
**Akira:** I won't feel right if I don't pay you back.  
**Mihono:** Sure, we'd be glad to have you, Inago-san!  
**Akira:** Akira's fine, Mihono.  
**Mihono:** Okay! Akira-san!  
**Mihono:** (Still... Why was she taking that noro? Was that part of President Hashima's orders too?)

## 7: Inago Akira, the Toji
**Mihono:** This is the third time we've gone in, isn't it?  
**Yui:** At this point, it's hard not to feel a little exhausted.  
**Akira:** Oi, no losing focus.  
**Mihono/Yui:** Right!  
**Hana:** She looks okay now, but... Yui's stamina might be reaching its limit.  
**Akira:** Doesn't that go for you too? Your swings are losing their sharpness.  
**Hana:** ...You could tell?  
**Akira:** How could I not?  
**Akira:** You ready? This is the last insertion. We're too late in the game for somebody to get seriously hurt here.  
**Hana:** ...I know.  
**Akira:** But still, don't go complaining. We're not about to leave a single person behind either.  
**Hana:** Right!  
**Mihono:** Hmm, there's nobody around here.  
**Yui:** It'd be a lot easier to search for people if we could shout for them, but then the aradama would come running...  
**Hana:** We're just going to have to search place by place as we go.  
**Yui:** Pant, pant...  
**Mihono:** Are you okay?  
**Yui:** Fine, just fine, I'm just so happy, surrounded by all these cuties.  
**Hana:** If she can joke around like that, she must be fine.  
**Akira:** ...Shut up for a second.  
**Mihono/Yui:** I-I'm sorry!  
**Akira:** Just shut up!  
**All Three:** ......  
**Akira:** ......  
**Akira:** I knew I heard something.  
**Hana:** Heard what?  
**???:** ......dy.  
**Mihono:** Ah, someone's saying something!  
**Yui:** Over that way!  
**Boy:** Ah... Some toji ladies...  
**Hana:** You were hiding in here?  
**Yui:** It's easy to overlook, isn't it.  
**Akira:** Damnit, why don't you pick somewhere easier to find.  
**Boy:** Eep...  
**Akira:** Huhh?  
**Boy:** UWAAAAAHHHHH!  
**Yui:** Boss made him cry!  
**Akira:** C'mon, if you're a man, then quit crying.  
**Boy:** B-Buttt...  
**Akira:** You managed to hold out on your own for this long, didn't you?  
**Boy:** Y-Yeah.  
**Akira:** Then, quit crying. You'll never keep anybody safe if you're crying all the time.  
**Boy:** ......Okay!  
**Akira:** Good, 'atta boy!  
**Mihono:** He stopped crying...  
**Yui:** That's why she's the boss!  
**Hana:** Does that have anything to do with it?  
**Akira:** Alright, Mihono! You're in charge of this brat!  
**Mihono:** Eh?  
**Akira:** He was crying up a storm.  
**Akira:** 'Course it was gonna attract aradama.  
**Boy:** It's my fault...  
**Akira:** Don't start crying! ...Just wait there!  
**Boy:** ...!  
**Akira:** Good boy; like that. Just leave all this... to me!  
**Akira:** ORAA!  
**Mihono:** Wow... Ow, hey, you're grabbing on too hard...  
**Boy:** ...  
**Mihono:** (He's watching her so seriously now... Even though he was crying before...)  
**Boy:** You can do it, toji lady!  
**Mihono:** (To this kid, Akira-san must look like a hero... She is pretty cool, isn't she.)  

## 8: Self-Consciousness and Determination
**Toji:** You can leave that boy with me.  
**Akira:** Counting on you.  
**Akira:** So long, brat! You be good!  
**Boy:** Thank you, toji lady!  
**Akira:** Yeah, take care.  
**Akira:** 'kay, he should be fine from here. Let's put in some effort and check the rest out.  
**All Three:** Yeah...  
**Akira:** Guess it's about time we took a break. You've all gotta be at your limit, right?  
**Hana:** I am...  
**Yui:** That's our boss... You can tell it all...  
**Mihono:** Yeah, the usual missions are tough, but... This is on a whole different level.  
**Yui:** That's cause it isn't so easy as just coming out here, beating all the aradama, and everything's okay.  
**Mihono:** From now on... There's going to be a lot more disasters like this happening, won't there.  
**Mihono:** And... A lot more people will get hurt...  
**Hana:** That's what we're here for; to save as many of those people as we can.  
**Mihono:** That's true...  
**Akira:** Is something on your mind?  
**Akira:** Go ahead and let me know then. I've always got time to give a kouhai some advice.  
**Mihono:** I always have this feeling like, I've gotta do something, but I'm not sure what it is I should be doing...  
**Akira:** ...Ahh, I think I get it. A buddy of mine, they've got the same kind of worries.  
**Akira:** I don't know if it's exactly the same, but you're wanting to change yourself, right?  
**Mihono:** I guess I want to change?  
**Akira:** Yeah. That's mostly how it is for them. Wanting to get tougher.  
**Mihono:** -!? I think you might be right!  
**Akira:** In that case, you've got to challenge yourself. Do whatever's toughest, cause that's what's best for you.  
**Hana:** (...Inago-san, she seems like the type who's good at looking after others. Calling her boss wasn't too far off the mark.)  
**Mihono:** Whatever's toughest... Maybe I will transfer to the police.  
**Yui:** You mean it!?  
**Yui:** Between Hana-san and Mihono-chan, I'd have a pretty girl whichever way I look!  
**Akira:** Dumbass! Don't drop your guard!   
**Yui:** Eh?  
**Aradama:** UUUOOOOOOOOO!!  
**Yui:** Gah!  
**Akira:** Mihono, Hana, get your utsushi up!  
**Mihono:** On it!  
**Hana:** Kh...!? I can't...!  
**Aradama:** GAAAAAAAAAA!!  
**Hana:** Ggh-!  
**Akira:** Tch, you're both at your limit then... Oi! If you're still breathing, then say something!  
**Yui:** I'm hurting, but, I'm fine...  
**Hana:** Same here... But, I don't think I can fight any more.  
**Akira:** HAAAAAAAAAAA!!  
**Akira:** Don't sweat it! I'm not letting you two get hurt again!  
**Yui:** Boss...  
**Akira:** Mihono!  
**Mihono:** Y-Yes!  
**Akira:** You get it now, right? What a toji needs is strength!  
**Mihono:** ...Right!  
**Akira:** Now, do what I tell you! We're not gonna let the aradama come near Hana or Yui anymore!  
**Akira:** Push out, and stop that aradama coming for us!  
**Mihono:** YAAH!  
**Aradama:** OOOUUUUU!!  
**Mihono:** Urgh...! I managed to stop it, somehow, but...!! Akira-san, I can't hold it off!  
**Akira:** That's plenty; you did good, Mihono.  
**Mihono:** Ah...  
**Mihono:** (Akira-san, she really is strong... I'm... nowhere near that.)  
**Akira:** ORAORAORA! Let's keep it going!  
**Mihono:** (...I do want to get stronger.)  

## 9: The Next Step
**Mai:** HAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!  
**Sawano:** With that, nearly all the aradama in the area should be suppressed now.  
**Sawano:** You were working hard, Yanase-san.  
**Mai:** Yes, you too.  
**Mai:** Um... Fukuda-san, do you know where it was that Mihono-chan went to fight?  
**Sawano:** If I remember... She should be at the shopping mall.  
**Mai:** The shopping mall...  
**Sawano:** You can go if you want. I can take care of the rest here.  
**Mai:** Thank you very much!  
**Mai:** Mihono-chan!  
**Mihono:** Ah, Mai!  
**Futaba:** Hey, Mihono! Since when did you become friends with Yanase-san?  
**Mihono:** Uhh, a little while ago?  
**Mai:** ...I'm glad you're safe, Mihono-chan. I heard lots of people were getting injured, and it made me worried.  
**Mihono:** Yeah, I'm just fine, but...  
**Mai:** But?  
**Hana:** They seriously did a number on the both of us.  
**Mai:** Suzumoto-san, and Yamashiro-san too!? Are you two okay...?  
**Hana:** Doesn't feel like I'm doing that great.  
	[ambulance siren]

  
**Yui:** Ah, sounds like our ride is here, Hana-san.  
**Hana:** That's our ride...?  
**Yui:** Seeya around, Mihono-chan! If you have the time to pay us a visit, you'll make my day! Okay!  
**Mai:** She really wanted to make a point of that while they carried her off...  
**Mihono:** That's Yui for you!  
**Futaba:** Anyway, Mihono, since when did you become friends with girls from Ayanokouji?  
**Mihono:** Umm, a little while ago?  
**Futaba:** You just keep saying that!  
**Mihono:** Excuse me.  
**Ema:** Asakura-san? Thank you, for your efforts the other day. What did you need?  
**Mihono:** Err... About what you said, about transferring to a unit under the MPD's command, can I still do that!?  
**Ema:** Of course, that would be fine, though... Did something happen?  
**Mihono:** Yeah. I talked to Yui and Suzumoto-san, and Akira-san gave me advice... I made up my mind.  
**Ema:** It sounds like you got the encouragement you needed.  
**Ema:** I understand. In that case, starting today, you'll be transferred to the Metropolitan Police Department.  
**Mihono:** Starting today!?  
**Ema:** Yes. Ever since you asked to be sent to the mall, I've been expecting this to come.  
**Ema:** The preparations were taken care of.  
**Mihono:** Uwah... Is it really that easy to tell what I'm going to do?  
**Ema:** I've seen a lot of girls like you, Asakura-san. For all of them, working with the MPD was a good experience.  
**Ema:** I hope the same will be true for you, Asakura-san.  
**Mihono:** ...Okay! I'm going then!  
**Mihono:** Hey, is Inago Akira-san here?  
**Sawano:** If you're looking for Inago-san, she isn't here yet...  
**Mihono:** Do you know how soon she'll be here?  
**Sawano:** Hmmm, I'm not sure? There are plenty of times Inago-san doesn't even come to school...  
**Mihono:** Oh, okay...  
**Mihono:** (I wanted to thank her about what happened before school started...)  
**Mihono:** (But I guess Akira-san's a delinquent after all.)  
**Akira:** Hello?  
**Akira:** Yeah, sorry. It wasn't in the plan, but I made contact with her.  
**Akira:** Mm... Yeah. There's no signs of her awakening yet.  
**Akira:** I think it's probably gonna take a bit more time.  
**Akira:** Yeah, got it. I'll keep on watching Asakura Mihono.
