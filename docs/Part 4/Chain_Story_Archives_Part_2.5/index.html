Investigation Team, Dissolved<a class="hash-link" href="#1-the-investigation-team-dissolved" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Not long after Tagitsuhime, fleeing to the netherworld, spread aradama-- special hazardous waste across the entirety of Kanto.</p><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> Excuse me.<br>
<strong>Hashima Ema:</strong> I&#x27;m sorry to call you in here when you&#x27;re so busy with your duties.<br>
<strong>Ema:</strong> I wanted to speak with you about what you&#x27;ll be doing from here on out, Asakura-san.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...From here on out\?<br>
<strong>Ema:</strong> You don&#x27;t have to look so anxious. You understand what the state of things is like now, don&#x27;t you\?<br>
<strong>Ema:</strong> The entire country, not only Kanto, has seen a rise in the frequency of aradama appearances. And not a day goes by without debate over Kamakura&#x27;s special hazardous waste leakage issue being broadcast on television.<br>
<strong>Ema:</strong> They&#x27;re going to be airing Akane-sama&#x27;s hearing very soon too.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...I know. Nothing&#x27;s like it used to be.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> There weren&#x27;t this many aradama before, and the STT didn&#x27;t spend this much time busy with missions.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Everyone from the investigation team never even gets to see each other anymore...<br>
<strong>Ema:</strong> About the investigation team, its activities are going to be suspended.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> There&#x27;s not going to be an investigation team anymore!\?<br>
<strong>Ema:</strong> It shouldn&#x27;t go away just yet.<br>
<strong>Ema:</strong> But, at least until the special hazardous waste problem is settled, you all won&#x27;t be taking any action as part of the investigation team.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Then, when you said we&#x27;d talk about what I&#x27;ll be doing from now on, do you mean you&#x27;re putting me in some other unit\?<br>
<strong>Ema:</strong> Asakura-san. There are two options available for you now.<br>
<strong>Ema:</strong> The first is to be part of a unit under the Five Traditions, working with the Special Task Team.<br>
<strong>Ema:</strong> The other is to become a provisional member of a unit under command of the Metropolitan Police Department. It will be difficult, but I think it would be a good experience for you.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Umm, when you say the Five Traditions, do you mean Minoseki\?<br>
<strong>Ema:</strong> You wouldn&#x27;t be wrong to think that.<br>
<strong>Ema:</strong> You might be relocated elsewhere... say, to Renpu, but you&#x27;ll primarily be working with Minoseki.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...That might be better then\?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Though, would I know anyone who&#x27;s working with the MPD\?<br>
<strong>Ema:</strong> Of course. There are others loaned to them, some who you should be familiar with... Let&#x27;s see, Suzumoto-san and Yamashiro-san should have transferred there.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Suzumoto-san and Yamashiro-san did...\?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> (Uuu... I don&#x27;t know. I never did get their phone numbers, so maybe I should go there\?)<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> (But, if I get transferred, I don&#x27;t really know what&#x27; I&#x27;d be doing. I feel like I&#x27;d get to be more useful working here with Mai and the others.)<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> (Yeah, I&#x27;ll go with that. I&#x27;ll get their phone numbers sooner or later, I know it!)<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Okay, I&#x27;ve made up my mind, President Hashima. I&#x27;m going to work hard here helping the STT.<br>
<strong>Ema:</strong> ...That&#x27;s fine.<br>
<strong>Ema:</strong> You&#x27;ll be part of one of Minoseki&#x27;s units, Asakura-san. Though, the offer to transfer to the MPD will always be available, so if you ever change your mind, come right here and tell me.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Okay!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> HAAAAAAAAAAAA!!<br>
<strong>Nagae Futaba:</strong> Wha, Mihono!\?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> We have to focus, Futaba! Let&#x27;s take care of the aradama first! We can talk later!<br>
<strong>Futaba:</strong> R-Right!<br>
<strong>Futaba:</strong> (I just went along with her, but... Is it me, or did Mihono get a heck of a lot stronger!\?)<br>
<strong>Futaba:</strong> (I remember Mihono being a lot more... Did something happen to her when she was with the investigation team\?)<br>
<strong>Fukuda Sawano:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Sawano:</strong> (...It&#x27;s only natural Nagae-san would be surprised. Compared to how she was during the tournament qualifiers... Asakura-san is fighting like a completely different person.)<br>
<strong>Sawano:</strong> (Working with the investigation team should have benefited her, but... Would it have made this much of a difference\?)<br>
<strong>Sawano:</strong> ...Asakura-san! Can you take care of things here\? I&#x27;ll go support the other units!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Sure, just leave it to me!<br>
<strong>Futaba:</strong> Sawano-san, what should I do!<br>
<strong>Sawano:</strong> ...Please come with me, Nagae-san! Asakura-san can handle herself here!<br>
<strong>Futaba:</strong> ...Okay!<br>
<strong>Futaba:</strong> (The way I am now, I&#x27;d just be weighing Mihono down... It&#x27;s so frustrating! It wasn&#x27;t that long ago that I could fight neck and neck with her!)<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> HAAA!!<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> GGGOOOOUUU!!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Grr, it&#x27;s fast...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> But still! I was working hard with the investigation team... So if I just calm down, I can do this!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Alright! Now for the next one!<br>
<strong>Futaba:</strong> ...Keep it up, Mihono!<br>
<strong>Futaba:</strong> (You&#x27;ll see, I&#x27;ll be right there fighting alongside you again soon!)<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Pant... Pant...<br>
<strong>Toji A:</strong> KYAAAAA!!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> -!\? Are you okay!\?<br>
<strong>Sawano:</strong> Don&#x27;t lose your focus! Help is already on the way!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> R-Right!<br>
<strong>Sawano:</strong> Those who can&#x27;t apply utsushi, help move the injured away from here! Nagae-san, keep them safe!<br>
<strong>Futaba:</strong> On it!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Sawano-san and Futaba can take care of things there! I have to... Defend this place no matter what!<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> GYUUUUOOOO!!<br>
<strong>Man:</strong> Whoa-!\? S-Somebody help meee!!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> -!\? --Jin&#x27;i!!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Are you alright!\?<br>
<strong>Man:</strong> Why the hell would I be alright!\? Do something about that monster already!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> O-Okay!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> HAAAAAAAAA!!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Now&#x27;s your chance, please get away to safety!<br>
<strong>Man:</strong> Get away to safety\?<br>
<strong>Man:</strong> I never got attacked by aradama before... Before you toji screwed everything up!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> S-Sorry...<br>
<strong>Man:</strong> Goddammit, why did this happen to me...! You&#x27;re supposed to show up before anyone gets hurt!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> (We&#x27;re doing the best we can to fight... So why...)<br>
<strong>Futaba:</strong> Mihono-, great work back there-.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Yeah, you too, Futaba.<br>
<strong>Futaba:</strong> \? You look kinda down; did something happen\?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Nah, it&#x27;s nothing!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I think I&#x27;m just a little worn out after how rough things got back there. Let&#x27;s get back to school quick!<br>
<strong>Futaba:</strong> Anyway, is it me, or did you seriously get way stronger, Mihono\? What kind of training did you do\? Did you hide away in the mountains or something!\?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> It wasn&#x27;t like that-.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="2-outbreak-of-a-large-scale-aradama-disaster"></a>2: Outbreak of a Large Scale Aradama Disaster<a class="hash-link" href="#2-outbreak-of-a-large-scale-aradama-disaster" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Announcement:</strong> A large scale aradama disaster has occurred. The toji on loan from the Five Traditions should prepare to sortie at once.<br>
<strong>Announcement:</strong> I repeat--<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> We only just got transferred here, and we&#x27;ve already got a hard job to do.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> How bad do you think it&#x27;s going to be\? Hopefully it&#x27;ll be like, \&quot;They made it sound so much worse!\&quot;, but...<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> I feel the same, Yui. That&#x27;s all we can hope for.<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> Looks like they sent the info to our phones.<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> ...!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> The affected area is an entire district...<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> We&#x27;re responsible for a shopping mall\?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> A shopping mall; that&#x27;s pretty big, isn&#x27;t it...<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> At the bare minimum... There could be several thousand shoppers there now.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Several thousand!\? How is our unit supposed to take care of all those people on our own!\?<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> Let&#x27;s calm down.<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> ...I think the MPD will have figured the same thing. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if they&#x27;re calling the Five Traditions for backup right now.<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> More importantly... Every moment we spend here, the number of victims is getting bigger.<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> We have to go now.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Right!<br>
<strong>Man:</strong> (I never got attacked by aradama before... Before you toji screwed everything up!)<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...We screwed everything up\?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I couldn&#x27;t tell him no... I mean, after what happened with Tagitsuhime...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ............<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ......This isn&#x27;t helping! Sitting around like this isn&#x27;t how I do things!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I&#x27;m going to go ask the president to send me on more missions!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Excuse m...<br>
<strong>Ema:</strong> A large scale aradama disaster\?<br>
<strong>Ema:</strong> You&#x27;re right, that location is right on our doorstep, however... We don&#x27;t have toji available that quickly.<br>
<strong>Ema:</strong> Yes, we need time to organize a unit, and.... Eh\? I understand that, but...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> (Large scale aradama disaster...\?)<br>
<strong>Ema:</strong> Then let&#x27;s see... I&#x27;ll need an hour at the least, before they can arrive there...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> (An hour... By the time an hour passes, how many people will get hurt...)<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> President Hashima, please let me go there!<br>
<strong>Ema:</strong> Asakura-san!\?<br>
<strong>Ema:</strong> ...I don&#x27;t have many, but I&#x27;ll send out the toji who are ready at once. Prevent any casualties as best you can until our units arrive.<br>
<strong>Ema:</strong> Are there any areas that are most threatened\? ...Yes... Alright... Understood.<br>
<strong>Ema:</strong> Asakura-san, you heard what we were discussing, didn&#x27;t you\?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I did! Where should I go\?<br>
<strong>Ema:</strong> I want you to go straight to the shopping mall. You&#x27;re to join forces with Suzumoto-san and Yamashiro-san there.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Suzumoto-san and Yamashiro-san!\?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> (Suzumoto-san and Yamashiro-san are already helping at the mall...)<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> (Come to think of it... Why did those two agree to transfer to the MPD anyway\?)<br>
<strong>Ema:</strong> Do you understand\? Rather than suppressing aradama, saving lives is your top priority. Think only about keeping casualties to a minimum.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Got it!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Mihono-chan!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> There was a large scale aradama outbreak! They&#x27;re organizing units, so we should go!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah, I know about it!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Eh\?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Just now, they called President Hashima for help with it. So I&#x27;m... I&#x27;m going on ahead!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Be careful, Mihono-chan!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I will!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="3-at-the-site"></a>3: At the Site<a class="hash-link" href="#3-at-the-site" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Ema:</strong> I want units sent to the three areas under the greatest threat!<br>
<strong>Ema:</strong> Gather Inago Akira, Fukuda Sawano, and Yanase Mai! Organize each of them a unit as fast as you can!<br>
<strong>Minoseki Instructor:</strong> President Hashima, Inago Akira still hasn&#x27;t come to school.<br>
<strong>Ema:</strong> Then find someone else with leadership experience. I&#x27;m going to try getting ahold of Inago-san.<br>
<strong>Inago Akira:</strong> ~~~~~!<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> C&#x27;mon, I was just getting in a good mood here. ...Huh\? President Hashima\?<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> What&#x27;s up\? It&#x27;s Inago Akira.<br>
<strong>Ema:</strong> Inago-san\? Where are you right now\?<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Just cruising &#x27;round near school; you need something\?<br>
<strong>Ema:</strong> There&#x27;s been a large scale aradama disaster. I wanted you to be in charge of one of the units responding, however...<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Since you&#x27;re not waiting for me to get back, it must&#x27;ve really gone to hell, huh.<br>
<strong>Ema:</strong> I would appreciate it if you would return right away...<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Hey-, you know it wouldn&#x27;t be me if I came back so fast.<br>
<strong>Ema:</strong> Really now, don&#x27;t admit that about yourself.<br>
<strong>Ema:</strong> Inago-san, I need for you to go to the shopping mall. I just allowed one of the middle school toji to leave for there in advance.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> She&#x27;s got guts. What&#x27;s her name\?<br>
<strong>Ema:</strong> Asakura Mihono-san. She made it rather far in the qualifiers for this year&#x27;s tournament...<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> ......Asakura Mihono, huh. Yeah yeah, I know her.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Alright, I&#x27;ll be there before you know it.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> First though...<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Ah, you there\? That mall right next to Minoseki... Oh, you heard already\?<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Yeah yeah... Anyway, it sounds like Asakura Mihono&#x27;ll be there, so I&#x27;m going to go see for myself.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Alright, time to floor it!<br>
<strong>Toji A:</strong> The insertion team has returned! Many people are injured!<br>
<strong>Toji B:</strong> The civilians take priority! Any toji who can no longer fight, fall to the rear!<br>
<strong>Toji A:</strong> Roger!<br>
<strong>Citizen A:</strong> My friend is still inside there! You have to hurry and rescue them!<br>
<strong>Toji B:</strong> You don&#x27;t have to worry. They&#x27;re working right now to rescue everyone they can...<br>
<strong>Citizen B:</strong> Give it a rest! Instead of making excuses, why don&#x27;t you get in there and save them! That&#x27;s what you get paid for, isn&#x27;t it!\?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...This is awful.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> (Ordinary people... And toji too. There&#x27;s so many of them getting hurt...)<br>
<strong>Citizen C:</strong> I saw all about it on TV! It&#x27;s because of their negligence that the aradama came spreading everywhere!!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> (Because we defeated Tagitsuhime... Was it wrong for us to do that...\?)<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...I&#x27;m a toji from Minoseki, here to help. Where are Suzumoto-san and Yamashiro-san at\?<br>
<strong>Toji A:</strong> If you want Suzumoto-san, she came out with us just now. She should be...<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> Asakura-san\?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Suzumoto-san! Thank goodness I found you! President Hashima told me to meet up with you.<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> President Hashima did...\? That&#x27;ll help a lot.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Where&#x27;s Yamashiro-san\?<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> She&#x27;s still fighting inside.<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> We couldn&#x27;t rescue all the people at once... So we&#x27;re trading off leading the people we have saved outside.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> In that case, we should hurry in there!<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Suzumoto-san\? Are you feeling tired\?<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> I am, but... I&#x27;m glad you&#x27;re here, Asakura-san.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ehh!\? I haven&#x27;t done anything yet...\?<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> Having someone as straightforward and positive as you around makes me feel like I can keep going.<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> The situation is awful, but it&#x27;s reassuring having you here. So much so that I wish you&#x27;d gone to the MPD.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> That&#x27;s...<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> You don&#x27;t sound interested in it. But, I&#x27;d be happy if you at least thought it over while we deal with this incident.<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> That said, this is also our first incident right after we transferred.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> It is\?<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> That&#x27;s right.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> It must be hard on you, having to start with something like this.<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> That&#x27;s for sure; I&#x27;m worried about where things are going at this rate. But... I&#x27;m glad I decided to transfer.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Huh\? Shouldn&#x27;t it be the other way around\?<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> Should it\?<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> I am feeling nervous, about getting thrown straight into this, and whether I&#x27;ll be able to keep up if it&#x27;s nothing but cases like this in the future...<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> But I know for a fact that I&#x27;ll get to protect a lot of people. I&#x27;m not going to regret that.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> (Protect a lot of people... Suzumoto-san put lot of thought into deciding to transfer, unlike me...)<br>
<strong>\?\?\?:</strong> KYAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> ...! That scream came from...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Let&#x27;s go, Suzumoto-san!  </p><div class="videoWrapper"><iframe width="640" height="480" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NhIKOCOdky8"></iframe></div><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="4-an-atmosphere-of-unrest"></a>4: An Atmosphere of Unrest<a class="hash-link" href="#4-an-atmosphere-of-unrest" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Akira:</strong> Seriously\? People won&#x27;t stop calling today... Tch, and it just had to be these assholes.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Yeah\?<br>
<strong>\?\?\?:</strong> If you&#x27;re entering the large scale aradama outbreak, you are to gather as much noro from it as possible.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Huhh\? Have you lost your damn mind\? Try getting your priorities straight here!<br>
<strong>\?\?\?:</strong> For that person&#x27;s desire to be realized, a great amount of noro is needed.<br>
<strong>\?\?\?:</strong> Inago Akira, you do understand, don&#x27;t you\?<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> You sure love running your mouth, huh. You think naming them would make me do whatever you say\?<br>
<strong>\?\?\?:</strong> Everything is to fulfill that desire. It isn&#x27;t as if I&#x27;m telling you to ignore the aradama, you know.<br>
<strong>\?\?\?:</strong> Suppress the aradama, retrieve their noro, and... Keep an eye on the girl. You can do that, can&#x27;t you\?<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Yeah, sure, I got it! While I&#x27;m suppressing the aradama, I&#x27;ll get you some noro!<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> That good enough for you!\?<br>
<strong>\?\?\?:</strong> We have high expectations.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> FUCK!<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> ...Sigh.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Ahh, feels a little better letting it out like that! Damnit, this is starting to get on my nerves.<br>
<strong>Toji A:</strong> Defend this position, no matter what!<br>
<strong>Tojis:</strong> Right!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> There&#x27;s this many aradama!\?<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> It&#x27;s like this everywhere inside. We keep killing them and killing them... And more aradama appear.<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> That&#x27;s why we left our unit at a key location and went to secure an escape route.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> Looking at it the other way, they can&#x27;t move from there. So we have to force our way in.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Okay!<br>
<strong>\?\?\?:</strong> No! Stay away!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Suzumoto-san, someone&#x27;s calling for help!<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> ...That way, huh. Let&#x27;s hurry, Asakura-san!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> There she is!<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> HAAAAAA!!<br>
<strong>Woman:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Are you okay!\?<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> Don&#x27;t move her!<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> ...There&#x27;s no injury on her head, and she doesn&#x27;t seem badly hurt... Alright, she only lost consciousness is all.<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> It should be okay if we wake her up.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> H-Hang on a minute!<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> What is it\?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah, uh, it&#x27;s just...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> (What if she starts acting the same as the people outside...)<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I think she was really scared of getting attacked by aradama... Wouldn&#x27;t it be better if we let her stay asleep\?<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> You have a point there.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...What&#x27;s most important for us now is finding Yamashiro-san. I&#x27;ll look to see if there&#x27;s someone else around who can help her.<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> I&#x27;m counting on you.<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> I didn&#x27;t expect that from you back there.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Huh\?<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> I was sure you&#x27;d offer to go and bring her outside yourself.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Should I have\?<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> No, it&#x27;s good you didn&#x27;t let your emotions get the better of you. You&#x27;re right that we should focus on meeting up with Yui first.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> (Didn&#x27;t let my emotions get the better of me\? I did though...)<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Suzumoto-san!<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> Stay quiet... We can let this aradama go.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Aren&#x27;t we going to beat it\?<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> Our number one priority is rescuing the people here. I know it sounds bad, but... Stopping the aradama comes second.<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> Good, it doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;s noticed us.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> Feeling frustrated\?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> That&#x27;s not it; there&#x27;s just something on my mind... Um, can I ask you something\?<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> What&#x27;s that\?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Suzumoto-san, why did you choose to be transferred\?<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> Why\?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> My school&#x27;s president asked me too; if I wanted to transfer.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> But back then, I told her no.<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> President Hashima must have high hopes for you, Asakura-san.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> She does...\?<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> Yeah. It&#x27;s very hard working here, so they&#x27;d never recommend a toji without the strength to back it up.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah...<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> Are you getting interested\?<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> When I decided to transfer, I was thinking about the future. I wanted to build up a connection with the police.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Suzumoto-san... You&#x27;re so mature.<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> You think so\?<br>
<strong>\?\?\?:</strong> HAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> That voice was... Yamashiro-san!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="5-at-a-crossroads"></a>5: At a Crossroads<a class="hash-link" href="#5-at-a-crossroads" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Aradama:</strong> OOOOOOOOUUUUU!!<br>

<strong>Yui:</strong> I&#x27;m fine, it&#x27;s fine, this is a walk in the park!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> ...ah, whoops.<br>
<strong>Man A:</strong> Look at you, you can barely stand up straight!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ahaha, I think I&#x27;m just getting a little hungry.<br>
<strong>Man A:</strong> Why don&#x27;t you rest for a while\?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> When Hana-san gets back, I&#x27;ll take a break. Don&#x27;t worry, she&#x27;ll be back any minute now.<br>
<strong>Man A:</strong> Still...<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> Yui!<br>
<strong>Man A:</strong> It&#x27;s that girl from before, and she brought help! Good, now you can get some rest.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ooh! And she&#x27;s a cutie too... Wait, that&#x27;s Mihono-chan!<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> Mihono-chan\? Yui, since when have you and Asakura-san been on a first name basis\?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Never, but I&#x27;m in the camp that believes in calling cute girls by their first name!<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> I figured... Sorry about her, Asakura-san.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ahaha, I&#x27;m totally okay with it! I&#x27;ll call you Yui too then.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Thanks, Mihono-chan! I feel like I could fight for another five hours now.<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> Five hours\? You&#x27;re keeping it realistic, huh.<br>
<strong>Man B:</strong> What are you standing around gossiping for!\? If you&#x27;ve got more toji, then start getting us out of here!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> -!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> (They&#x27;re like this here too...)<br>
<strong>Man A:</strong> Don&#x27;t talk to them like that! These girls are risking their lives fighting for us!<br>
<strong>Woman:</strong> You shouldn&#x27;t pay him any mind. Thank you, for coming all this way... Really, truly, thank you...<br>
<strong>Woman:</strong> It was horrible... So many times, I thought it was all over...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...You don&#x27;t have to worry! We&#x27;ll keep you all safe, no matter what!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Then, let&#x27;s get to it... whoops.<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> Don&#x27;t overdo it, Yui. Asakura-san and I will keep guard, so you can take a quick break.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ugh, sorry. I&#x27;ll do that.<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> Oh, right.<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> Do you mind if I ask why you decided to transfer, Yui\?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Where&#x27;s this coming from\? Could it be, you&#x27;re just so interested in me you can&#x27;t help it!\?<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> Asakura-san asked me about it before. Now seemed like a good time, so I figured I&#x27;d ask you too.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Thanks, Suzumoto-san.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Does that mean you&#x27;re joining us, Mihono-chan\?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Uhh, I&#x27;m considering it... After seeing things here, I started feeling sort of conflicted, I guess\?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I see, so there&#x27;s a chance, huh.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Hmm, okay. I guess I did it for the money\? See, if you get loaned to the police, they start paying you a bit more.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...I kind of wasn&#x27;t expecting that from you.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Fu fu fu, at Ayanokouji, they don&#x27;t call me \&quot;the girl you never see coming\&quot; for nothing!<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> Did that help you any\?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah. I can tell you and Yui both put a lot of thought into why you transferred.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> And I...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> (All I thought about was whether I&#x27;d stay with everyone. I should really... Think about it harder now.)<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> What was that sound!\?<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> It sounded like glass breaking, but... It&#x27;s sort of unsettling not knowing what happened.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I&#x27;ll go check it out then! Suzumoto-san and Yui-san, you stay here!<br>
<strong>\?\?\?:</strong> ORA!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> (Somebody&#x27;s fighting\?)<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> (The broken glass... Is that a motorcycle\? Did the motorcycle come crashing through\?)<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> (But why in here...\?)<br>
<strong>\?\?\?:</strong> C&#x27;mon, I don&#x27;t have time for you small fry. Quit swarming me, damnit.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> (She&#x27;s backup\? She&#x27;s wearing a Minoseki uniform, but... I&#x27;ve never seen her before.)<br>
<strong>\?\?\?:</strong> Finally...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> (!\? She&#x27;s collecting the noro\? Why is she doing that now, like she&#x27;s hiding it...)<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> That&#x27;s enough!<br>
<strong>\?\?\?:</strong> Huh\?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I&#x27;m Asakura Mihono, second year at Minoseki Academy&#x27;s middle school division! What are you doing out here\?<br>
<strong>\?\?\?:</strong> ...Asakura Mihono.<br>
<strong>\?\?\?:</strong> (&#x27;Course she&#x27;d be suspicious of a toji acting on their own in a place like this.)<br>
<strong>\?\?\?:</strong> (Wasn&#x27;t planning on making contact yet, but... Can&#x27;t exactly explain what I was doing with the noro to her...)<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>\?\?\?:</strong> (Kashuu Kiyomitsu... It really is broken.)<br>
<strong>\?\?\?:</strong> (Or, well...)<br>
<strong>\?\?\?:</strong> You&#x27;ve gotta lot of nerve, don&#x27;tcha\? Just gonna point your okatana at your senpai like that\? Huhh\?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...First, just answer me this. What are you doing here\?<br>
<strong>\?\?\?:</strong> First, gimme an apology for pulling your okatana on me. I&#x27;m your senpai, y&#x27;know\?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...<br>

<strong>Hana:</strong> ...Is that how it went.<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> (President Hashima likely told her to do the same thing she told Mihono... So what did Mokusa want her to do\?)<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> (Well, she probably wouldn&#x27;t give me an answer even if I asked.)<br>

<strong>Akira:</strong> Sure, call me whatever.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Will do!<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> And, I didn&#x27;t mean for things to get out of hand before, Mihono. I lost my cool and wasn&#x27;t thinking straight.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> No, I shouldn&#x27;t have taken out my okatana before I even asked you anything.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Though, if President Hashima sent you, you should&#x27;ve said so sooner.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> My bad, but President Hashima didn&#x27;t tell me anything more than to head over here.<br>

<strong>Hana:</strong> Kh...!\? I can&#x27;t...!<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> GAAAAAAAAAA!!<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> Ggh-!<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Tch, you&#x27;re both at your limit then... Oi! If you&#x27;re still breathing, then say something!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I&#x27;m hurting, but, I&#x27;m fine...<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> Same here... But, I don&#x27;t think I can fight any more.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> HAAAAAAAAAAA!!<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Don&#x27;t sweat it! I&#x27;m not letting you two get hurt again!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Boss...<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Mihono!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Y-Yes!<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> You get it now, right\? What a toji needs is strength!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Right!<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Now, do what I tell you! We&#x27;re not gonna let the aradama come near Hana or Yui anymore!<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Push out, and stop that aradama coming for us!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> YAAH!<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> OOOUUUUU!!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Urgh...! I managed to stop it, somehow, but...!! Akira-san, I can&#x27;t hold it off!<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> That&#x27;s plenty; you did good, Mihono.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> (Akira-san, she really is strong... I&#x27;m... nowhere near that.)<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> ORAORAORA! Let&#x27;s keep it going!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> (...I do want to get stronger.)  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="9-the-next-step"></a>9: The Next Step<a class="hash-link" href="#9-the-next-step" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Mai:</strong> HAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!<br>
<strong>Sawano:</strong> With that, nearly all the aradama in the area should be suppressed now.<br>
<strong>Sawano:</strong> You were working hard, Yanase-san.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Yes, you too.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Um... Fukuda-san, do you know where it was that Mihono-chan went to fight\?<br>
<strong>Sawano:</strong> If I remember... She should be at the shopping mall.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> The shopping mall...<br>
<strong>Sawano:</strong> You can go if you want. I can take care of the rest here.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Thank you very much!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Mihono-chan!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah, Mai!<br>
<strong>Futaba:</strong> Hey, Mihono! Since when did you become friends with Yanase-san\?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Uhh, a little while ago\?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> ...I&#x27;m glad you&#x27;re safe, Mihono-chan. I heard lots of people were getting injured, and it made me worried.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah, I&#x27;m just fine, but...<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> But\?<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> They seriously did a number on the both of us.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Suzumoto-san, and Yamashiro-san too!\? Are you two okay...\?<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> Doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m doing that great.<br>
[ambulance siren]</p><p><strong>Yui:</strong> Ah, sounds like our ride is here, Hana-san.<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> That&#x27;s our ride...\?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Seeya around, Mihono-chan! If you have the time to pay us a visit, you&#x27;ll make my day! Okay!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> She really wanted to make a point of that while they carried her off...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> That&#x27;s Yui for you!<br>
<strong>Futaba:</strong> Anyway, Mihono, since when did you become friends with girls from Ayanokouji\?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Umm, a little while ago\?<br>
<strong>Futaba:</strong> You just keep saying that!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Excuse me.<br>
<strong>Ema:</strong> Asakura-san\? Thank you, for your efforts the other day. What did you need\?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Err... About what you said, about transferring to a unit under the MPD&#x27;s command, can I still do that!\?<br>
<strong>Ema:</strong> Of course, that would be fine, though... Did something happen\?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah. I talked to Yui and Suzumoto-san, and Akira-san gave me advice... I made up my mind.<br>
<strong>Ema:</strong> It sounds like you got the encouragement you needed.<br>
<strong>Ema:</strong> I understand. In that case, starting today, you&#x27;ll be transferred to the Metropolitan Police Department.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Starting today!\?<br>
<strong>Ema:</strong> Yes. Ever since you asked to be sent to the mall, I&#x27;ve been expecting this to come.<br>
<strong>Ema:</strong> The preparations were taken care of.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Uwah... Is it really that easy to tell what I&#x27;m going to do\?<br>
<strong>Ema:</strong> I&#x27;ve seen a lot of girls like you, Asakura-san. For all of them, working with the MPD was a good experience.<br>
<strong>Ema:</strong> I hope the same will be true for you, Asakura-san.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Okay! I&#x27;m going then!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Hey, is Inago Akira-san here\?<br>
<strong>Sawano:</strong> If you&#x27;re looking for Inago-san, she isn&#x27;t here yet...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Do you know how soon she&#x27;ll be here\?<br>
<strong>Sawano:</strong> Hmmm, I&#x27;m not sure\? There are plenty of times Inago-san doesn&#x27;t even come to school...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Oh, okay...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> (I wanted to thank her about what happened before school started...)<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> (But I guess Akira-san&#x27;s a delinquent after all.)<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Hello\?<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Yeah, sorry. It wasn&#x27;t in the plan, but I made contact with her.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Mm... Yeah. There&#x27;s no signs of her awakening yet.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> I think it&#x27;s probably gonna take a bit more time.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Yeah, got it. I&#x27;ll keep on watching Asakura Mihono.  </p><blockquote><p>:ToCPrevNext</p></blockquote></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations/edit/docs/Part 4/Chain_Story_Archives_Part_2.5.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_2_ui" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_3DPF"></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/tnm-translations/docs/Part 4/4-8_The_Changing_World/"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Â« 4-8 The Changing World</div></a></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/tnm-translations/docs/Part 5/5-1_Kashuu_Kiyomitsu/"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Next</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">5-1 Kashuu Kiyomitsu Â»</div></a></div></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_35-E thin-scrollbar"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#1-the-investigation-team-dissolved" class="table-of-contents__link">1: The Investigation Team, Dissolved</a></li><li><a href="#2-outbreak-of-a-large-scale-aradama-disaster" class="table-of-contents__link">2: Outbreak of a Large Scale Aradama Disaster</a></li><li><a href="#3-at-the-site" class="table-of-contents__link">3: At the Site</a></li><li><a href="#4-an-atmosphere-of-unrest" class="table-of-contents__link">4: An Atmosphere of Unrest</a></li><li><a href="#5-at-a-crossroads" class="table-of-contents__link">5: At a Crossroads</a></li><li><a href="#6-evaluation" class="table-of-contents__link">6: Evaluation</a></li><li><a href="#7-inago-akira-the-toji" class="table-of-contents__link">7: Inago Akira, the Toji</a></li><li><a href="#8-self-consciousness-and-determination" class="table-of-contents__link">8: Self-Consciousness and Determination</a></li><li><a href="#9-the-next-step" class="table-of-contents__link">9: The Next Step</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Links</div><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://pastebin.com/LdyviZ8Z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Translator anon&#x27;s pastebin<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Site source code<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Built with Docusaurus.</div></div></div></footer></div>
