What did you want to talk with us about?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> It seems that next month, police stations will be holding an &quot;Aradama Safety Awareness Campaign.&quot;<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Since toji are a part of the overall police organization, they&#x27;ve requested our help in the form of &quot;working with a separate unit.&quot;<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Aradama Safety Awareness Campaign!? What&#x27;re we going to have to do for that?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I&#x27;ve only heard a rough outline of the campaign myself...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> But it sounds like they want us to go out wearing police uniforms and help people understand ways they can prevent being harmed by aradama.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ehh; that sounds fun! I want to try!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong>ã€€Me too! Being a toji&#x27;s fun, but I want to see what it&#x27;s like for other parts of the police.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> I think I&#x27;ll volunteer for it too. I&#x27;ve always wanted to try wearing a police uniform.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Kanami-chan and Mihono-chan and Chie-san dressed up like police officers!? Just thinking about it&#x27;s getting my heart pounding!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Chie-san, if you could do me a favor, could you arrest me first~?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> So you want to be the one getting arrested, Yui-chan...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Before going any further, I&#x27;d better exclude this pervert from the candidates.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Sure! Go right ahead. I have to be there that day besides, with with the best telescopic camera I can get, to preserve them all dressed up!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> So, how are we going to decide who goes anyway?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> We don&#x27;t have a schedule for next month&#x27;s assignments yet, so you can volunteer without worrying about whether it conflicts with your regular duties.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> They&#x27;ve asked for us to send 3 people. If you&#x27;d like to go, raise your hands.<br>
<strong>Chie/Mihono/Kanami:</strong> Heeere!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Cool; that&#x27;s 3 of us! That means we&#x27;re good to go, right?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> It seems that way. It&#x27;s nice we could settle it so easily...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Sorry, this call is from HQ.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Yes, Kitora speaking. ...Eh? They&#x27;ve rescheduled the campaign!? ...I see. Thank you for notifying me. Goodbye.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> They had unfortunate news. The campaign will now be held on an earlier date.<br>
<strong>Chie/Mihono/Kanami:</strong> EHH-!?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> It&#x27;s going to be one week from now; will that be an issue for any of you?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ehh; but I&#x27;m doing an expedition then!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Same here!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> I have an important meeting that day too...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I see... We&#x27;ll need to make rearrangements then. The ones who will be available on that day are...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> J-Just the three of us...?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Are you for real? Literally anybody else&#x27;d be better for doing that kind of campaign!<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> ...She&#x27;s not wrongg. I don&#x27;t think these are the right people to cheerily spreading awareness.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I understand your point, but as a branch of the police, this is an indisputable duty of ours. There won&#x27;t be any turning it down.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Seriously...? I already know this&#x27;ll go bad.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="2-the-campaign-involves"></a>2: The Campaign Involves...!?<a class="hash-link" href="#2-the-campaign-involves" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>On the day of the campaign.</p><p><strong>Police PR Official:</strong> Thank you, all of you, for coming out to our station today. I know it&#x27;s a little sudden, but could you change into these police uniforms?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Police uniforms... Right, the point of the campaign was to wipe out aradama dressed in these?<br>
<strong>Police PR Official:</strong> Aradama!? You&#x27;ve got it all wrong. This is what we wanted you to take care of today. Handing out these pamphlets.<br>
<strong>Police PR Official:</strong> Toji, dressed up in police uniform, giving pamphlets on how to avoid being harmed by aradama. Sounds like a decent way to spread awareness, doesn&#x27;t it?<br>
<strong>Police PR Official:</strong> So anyway, I&#x27;ll come back to get you when you&#x27;re finished changing. Thanks again for helping out.<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> They left us to itt.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Handing out pamphlets... Is there really a point in getting toji to do that?<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> ...I don&#x27;t know about that, but civil servants have to follow orders, so let&#x27;s get ready to do it.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Tch, I&#x27;d rather be going wild on some aradama-chan than handing out some dumb pamphlets...<br>
<strong>Station Intercom:</strong> Aradama outbreak! Aradama outbreak! Riot squat, dispatch at once!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Ohh! All I had to do was ask for some!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Good thing it happened before we got changed. Let&#x27;s move out.<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> Guoooooo...<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> ...--!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Hey, hold up, let me have those! OORYAH---!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> TAAAAAAAAHH!!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> The hell, we cleared them out in a second. Where&#x27;s the fun in that.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> I&#x27;m glad we could at least do something to help before dealing with the pamphlets. Come on, let&#x27;s get back to the station.<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> ......We&#x27;re backk.<br>
<strong>Police PR Official:</strong> Geez, you just got here and you&#x27;re already putting in some serious work. Thanks a lot.<br>
<strong>Police Officer 1:</strong> It&#x27;s incredible how fast they handled it. You toji really are something.<br>
<strong>Police Officer 2:</strong> I couldn&#x27;t believe how quick you got out there. You sure are reliable.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Hey... Aren&#x27;t there more of you now? ...What are they here for?<br>
<strong>Police PR Official:</strong> See, after they saw you deal with those aradama, the police around the station were saying, it&#x27;s such a waste just having them handing out pamphlets! They came around wanting you to help their departments.<br>
<strong>Police Officer 1:</strong> We&#x27;re all just different parts of the police, so don&#x27;t you think you could help with some detective work?<br>
<strong>Police Officer 2:</strong> Hang on, I want them to take a look at our riot squad training first!<br>
<strong>Police Officer 3:</strong> Hey, the traffic department could use their abilities more than anybody! With that speed of yours...<br>
<strong>Police PR Official:</strong> So, well, it ended up like this... What do you think? Would you help us with some other assignments besides the pamphlets?<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> Hmmm, they all seem very different from what toji are used to doing...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> If they need us, I think we should help them out.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Hey, it beats pamphlet duty at least.<br>
<strong>Police PR Official:</strong> Great. Then, if we could split you 3 up and help with each of the departments.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="3-who-will-prove-themselves"></a>3: Who Will Prove Themselves?<a class="hash-link" href="#3-who-will-prove-themselves" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> That&#x27;s the morning&#x27;s work finally taken care of. Police work sure is pretty demanding in a lot of ways.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Yeah. I didn&#x27;t even get to beat any aradama-chan but the day&#x27;s already half over.<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> ......It sounds like, in the afternoon, all of us will be working together to help the detective department.<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> They said, after we had our fill in the cafeteria, to meet in the shopping district wearing our school uniforms.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> In our uniforms? We don&#x27;t have to wear the police uniforms anymore?<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> They want us to tail a suspect while dressed as everyday schoolgirls... We should be fine like this.<br>
<strong>Detective:</strong> Hey, I&#x27;m glad you could make it. Today, I want you to help us catch a repeat purse-snatcher in this shopping district by tailing someone.<br>
<strong>Detective:</strong> Oh-- the suspect&#x27;s already arrived. If you girls could act natural and follow after them.<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> ......Understood.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Hm? The suspect&#x27;s going inside a store. What should we do?<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> ......Let&#x27;s stay out of sight and wait for them to come back out for now.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Oi, we haven&#x27;t seen anything from them after they went in. How long do we have to wait out here for?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Waiting patiently seems like a big part of tailing someone.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Damnit... How long&#x27;re you gonna make us wait for! Aghh, I&#x27;m starting to get pissed off just standing around!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Ah-- they just left the store. They&#x27;re looking kind of suspicious too; should we catch them before they try anything?<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> ...They haven&#x27;t done anything yet, so we wouldn&#x27;t be able to arrest them if we went noww. Let&#x27;s be patient until they make a move.<br>
<strong>Detective:</strong> That&#x27;s exactly right. It&#x27;s commendable the way you&#x27;re keeping a level head.<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> It&#x27;s not that impressive... It&#x27;s just that it&#x27;d be extremely inefficient to let them get away with this many people staking them out...<br>
<strong>Detective:</strong> Hahahah, you&#x27;re right about that. We could use someone like you... Ah--!<br>
<strong>Detective:</strong> The suspect grabbed an old lady&#x27;s purse and made a break for it! After them!<br>
<strong>Hirona/Hiyori/Kofuki:</strong> On it!<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> We&#x27;ve apprehended the criminal...<br>
<strong>Detective:</strong> Hey, nice work.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> You really knew what to do, Hirona.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Damnit; if only I&#x27;d jumped them with you.<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> ...Shichinosato-san, you were wasting your concentration by moving around needlessly before the suspect moved.<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> There&#x27;s limit to how much someone can concentrate. I could focus on arresting them efficiently since I made sure to only act after they started doing something suspicious.<br>
<strong>Detective:</strong> Thanks, all 3 of you, for helping with this. I&#x27;ll handle the rest, so could you go see what the traffic department needs you for next?<br>
<strong>Detective:</strong> They said they wanted you there as soon as possible, so don&#x27;t worry about getting changed. Give them my regards.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="4-toji-vs-speeding-violation"></a>4: Toji VS Speeding Violation!?<a class="hash-link" href="#4-toji-vs-speeding-violation" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Hirona:</strong> ...Thank you for your service. The three of us toji are here to help the traffic divisionn.<br>
<strong>Traffic Officer:</strong> Good, you&#x27;re here. What we want you to help us with are managing speeding violations.<br>
<strong>Traffic Officer:</strong> This area sees a lot of speeding, so I&#x27;d like you to stand at the ready here and help us catch any speeding cars.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> I get it; if it&#x27;s a race, I should be good with this.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Yeah, I&#x27;m not losing to Hirona either.<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> ...Ah, it turned into a competition.<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> (Though, it made the two of them motivated... Let&#x27;s just work with this.)<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Mmh, that car that just went by was going way too fast.<br>
<strong>Traffic Officer:</strong> They&#x27;re clearly going over the speed limit.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Leave this one to me!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Hey, wait up! I&#x27;m not going down without a fight!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Nn...? The car should be right in front of us, but it&#x27;s gone. Did it get away down a side road...!?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> You gotta be kidding... That side road was back up there, wasn&#x27;t it? Whatever, let&#x27;s get back fast.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...Wait, huh? Doesn&#x27;t that look like a traffic jam up on the frontage road?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Seems like it. Why would there be so much traffic this far out of town though...<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Check it out! That car from before&#x27;s stuck in traffic!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> That&#x27;s awfully convenient... Let&#x27;s get it before it gets away.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Hm? Hirona and the officer are already at the car. Hey, Hirona, what happened here?<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> ...Ah, Juujou-san, Shichinosato-san. We safely pulled over the speeding car. Thank you for your helpp.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Help...? Did you catch them again?<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> The police officer is the one who caught them. I only caused the traffic jam so the car would stop.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> You made a traffic jam!? How&#x27;d you do that?<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> I asked the other police officers to close the frontage roadss.<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong>  ...Even if we caught up to the runaway car using jin&#x27;i, there&#x27;s no guarantee they would stopp.<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> It&#x27;s good we could catch them before they caused an accident.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> That&#x27;s some great planning on your part.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Not too bad for you.<br>
<strong>Traffic Officer:</strong> That&#x27;s right. Nitta-san, I&#x27;m impressed you could think so rationally in the spur of the moment. Maybe you could stay on with us in the traffic department here.<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> ...Thank you for the offerr.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Still, Kofuki and I didn&#x27;t get to do much, did we.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Not like I really care. So long as I get to have fun with some aradama-chan, I&#x27;m good.<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> GUOOOOOOO...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Aradama!?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m talking about! If we&#x27;re fighting aradama-chan, nobody&#x27;s beating me!

<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Kgh... Even beating them one after another, more and more are coming out...<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> ...Though I guess I can&#x27;t go saying that. It would ruin my efficiency if I lost reputation for neglecting my duties.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> (If we keep fighting here though, the people caught in the traffic jam could get hurt...)<br>

<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Alright, this&#x27;ll do. Stick with me.<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> GUOOOOOOOO...<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Oi oi, what the hell are you thinking, dragging us out into the hills?<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> I understand the point was to lead them away from people, to keep casualties to a minimum...<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> But was there really a need to bring them this far... It&#x27;s a dead end at the cliff up ahead, isn&#x27;t itt?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Yeah, that&#x27;s right. So come on, all you aradama, this way!<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> ...The aradama you&#x27;re leading are getting backed up in front of the cliff. It&#x27;s like...!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> One big aradama-chan traffic jam!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> I got the idea from your plan before, Hirona.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> If we gather up the aradama in one spot where they can&#x27;t move, it&#x27;ll be simple for the three of us to clear them out.<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> That is a nicely efficient plan. We should start then.<br>
<strong>Hirona/Hiyori/Kofuki:</strong> YAAAAAAAAAHH!!!!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Three toji, returning from suppressing aradama.<br>
<strong>Police PR Official:</strong> Welcome back. And it looks like you&#x27;ve put in some serious work again. Thanks for protecting the people.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> We just did what&#x27;s expected of us as toji. So, what&#x27;s our next assignment...?<br>
<strong>Police PR Official:</strong> There&#x27;s plenty of things we&#x27;d like your help with, but unfortunately, that&#x27;s it for today&#x27;s work.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...Isn&#x27;t there anything more we could help a little with? We weren&#x27;t really that useful in the end...<br>
<strong>Police PR Official:</strong> Not at all; you helped out more than enough.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> You heard &#x27;em. Let&#x27;s get out of here, Hiyori. It&#x27;s more fun for me playing with aradama-chan anyway.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...Alright then. Thanks for everything today.<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> ...I&#x27;ll be leaving now too. I learned a lot from Juujou-san&#x27;s combat tactics, so it was a valuable experience.<br>
<strong>Police PR Official:</strong> Good work, all of you. Ah, Nitta-san. If you like the sound of it, maybe consider a career as a police officer?<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> ...A police officer...? I guess so. It depends on the cost benefits, but I&#x27;ll consider itt.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="6-another-call-from-the-police-station"></a>6: Another Call from the Police Station!?<a class="hash-link" href="#6-another-call-from-the-police-station" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> Hirona, I heard you were awesome in that police campaign they did!<br>

<strong>Mirja:</strong> Actually, it&#x27;ll be next week.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Next week!?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Yes. The last campaign was very well received with the police, so they&#x27;ve sent us another request.<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> ...That&#x27;s very sudden of them.<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> But, that&#x27;s good to hear. It it was worth working so hard if it gives the rest of you a chancee.<br>

<strong>Hirona:</strong> Eh...?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> From the sound of it, your efforts caught the eye of the higher ups at the station, so they specifically requested you.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Wowww! Way to go, Hirona!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Who else is going? Do I get to go?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Only Nitta Hirona and 2 others will be going, but the only ones without plans on that day are... Mashiko Kaoru and Kohagura Ellen.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Wow! Kaoru and I get to be police officers!?<br>
<strong>Mashiko:</strong> Gehh... Do we have to? I thought I&#x27;d get to spend that day lazing around.<br>
The day of the event.</p><p><strong>Police PR Official:</strong> Nitta-san, we&#x27;re glad to have you back. We&#x27;re looking forward to working with you again.<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> Okayy. Please take care of mee.<br>
<strong>Police PR Official:</strong> We&#x27;re looking forward to working with you two too.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> You can count on us! So then, what should we be doing?<br>
<strong>Police PR Official:</strong> This time, we&#x27;d like you all to act as police chief and deputies for the day.<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> ...That&#x27;s an important positionn... Should toji really be doing it?<br>
<strong>Police PR Official:</strong> Sure. Actually, if I&#x27;m being honest, we were originally going to invite local idols for the position, but something came up all of a sudden...<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> That explains why this came out of nowhere. So we&#x27;re just here to fill in as best we can.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Now now, Kaoru. We&#x27;re all members of the same police organization here, so let&#x27;s make sure to do our duty!<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong>  That&#x27;s right, it&#x27;s less cost-effective rushing to call in outside workers, so I think they made a sensible choice.<br>
<strong>Police PR Official:</strong> We&#x27;re only having you do a ceremonial event this time; all you need is to say a few greetings and ride a car in a parade. So, don&#x27;t take it too seriously and just have fun with it.<br>
<strong>Police PR Official:</strong> We have uniforms for you here, so go ahead and get changed. I&#x27;ll leave you to it.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Police chief and deputies for a day... It&#x27;s just for show, right? Heheh, today&#x27;s basically a day off then.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Kaoru, you can&#x27;t go slacking off. If anything goes wrong, we&#x27;ll have to do what we can to help too.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Let&#x27;s make sure we&#x27;re ready to do this. You, me, and Hirona too.<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> ...Okayy. It is our mission, after all. I&#x27;ll try to do what I&#x27;ve been assigned with as little effort needed.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="7-go-forth-police-chief-and-deputies-for-the-day"></a>7: Go Forth! Police Chief and Deputies for the Day<a class="hash-link" href="#7-go-forth-police-chief-and-deputies-for-the-day" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Police PR Official:</strong> Here, hang this over your shoulder.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Wow! A &quot;Police Chief for the Day&quot; sash! Is it really okay for me to be police chief?<br>
<strong>Police PR Official:</strong> You&#x27;re the tallest, and you seem like you make a good leader, so I think you&#x27;re the best fit. Now, if you two could put these sashes on.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Chief deputy? Now that&#x27;s the best position; if things go wrong, I can dump it all on the chief.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> If things go wrong, we&#x27;re all going to work together to fix it. Right, Hirona?<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> ...Right. I&#x27;ll do what I cann.<br>
<strong>Police PR Official:</strong> Alright then, let&#x27;s head right out for the parade. We want you three to smile and wave from the car to the people on the roadside.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> We can handle smiling! You can do that, right, Kaoru, Hirona?<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> ...Smiling... smiling... Would this be enough...?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Looking very cute, Hirona! Hm? You have a nice grin too, Kaoru. What for?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> All the people on the side of the road are looking at me and waving. The deputy chief for the day&#x27;s making her grand appearance! Make way, make way-!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Do you think you&#x27;re a daimyo or something?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Oh, come to think of it. I never get to do luxurious missions like this, so I couldn&#x27;t help it...<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> Still, we aren&#x27;t even performers, so I feel sort of bad for doing thiss...<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Why? Rather than calling up some idols, it&#x27;s cheaper to get civil servants to do it. Plus the police were happy about it anyway, weren&#x27;t they?<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> That&#x27;s fine, but... this is too different from last time...<br>
<strong>Radio Transmission:</strong> This is HQ... A man who recently burgled a residential area is currently making an escape through the central avenue intersection...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Central avenue intersection... Isn&#x27;t that where we just passed through?<br>
<strong>Police PR Official:</strong> We&#x27;re stopping the parade temporarily and going after the criminal. Can you all help us with that?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Of course we will! The police chief and deputies for the day are moving out!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> [pant pant]... Why&#x27;d this guy have to be so fast... Freeze already... [pant pant]...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> [pant pant]... We completely lost sight of him...<br>
<strong>Police Officer:</strong> Now we&#x27;re in trouble. There&#x27;s a maze of alleys in here, so all it takes is losing sight of him once...<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> Ah...! Then, what if you brought out police dogs?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Good thinking, Hirona! Would that work, Mr. Policeman?<br>
<strong>Police Officer:</strong> I&#x27;d love to give them a try, but police dogs have a very touchy sense of smell. They wouldn&#x27;t be much help going down streets lined with restaurants.<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> ...Oh... I hadn&#x27;t even thought of that.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> But then, how are we supposed to find him again...<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> If it were an aradama, all it&#x27;d take is a look at the spectrum finder. Not much we can do against a person though...<br>
<strong>Nene:</strong> Nene! Nenee----!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Nn? What&#x27;s wrong, Nene?<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> ...Could he be telling us to go that way?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> We don&#x27;t have any other leads, so we might as well try following Nene.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="8-can-you-make-the-arrest-police-chief-for-the-day"></a>8: Can You Make the Arrest, Police Chief for the Day!?<a class="hash-link" href="#8-can-you-make-the-arrest-police-chief-for-the-day" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Nene:</strong> Nene-! Nee- nene-!<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> [pant pant]... Now we&#x27;re in the back alleys of back alleys...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> We&#x27;re moving too fast, the police can&#x27;t keep up! Let&#x27;s wait a minute!<br>
<strong>Nene:</strong> Neene-! Nenene-!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Looks like we don&#x27;t have that kind of time; just have to keep going. What now, chief and deputy for the day?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> It won&#x27;t do us any good if he gets away from us like this. Let&#x27;s keep going!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> [pant pant]... We came pretty far; are we sure this guy&#x27;s even in here...?<br>
<strong>Nene:</strong> Nene-! Nenenene-!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Wow! Isn&#x27;t that the criminal running over there!?<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> I think that&#x27;s a dead end up ahead. Why don&#x27;t we corner him there?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> [pant pant]... We&#x27;ve finally got you trapped! You&#x27;re gonna pay for making me run so much... We&#x27;re arresting you right here!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Hang on, Kaoru! The police officers still aren&#x27;t here yet!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Kgh... Nene must&#x27;ve been too fast for them to catch up.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Would we get in trouble if we arrested him on our own without asking first?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Maybe... If it were an aradama, we could deal with it whenever we wanted, but when it comes to people... Still, we can&#x27;t just leave him like this...<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> ...Umm? What are you so confused aboutt? I&#x27;m handcuffing him.<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> 11:35 AM, culprit arrested.<br>
<strong>Kaoru/Ellen:</strong> Huh...?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Is that okay? For us to just go ahead and arrest him.<br>
<strong>Culprit:</strong> Like hell it&#x27;s okay! Just cause you&#x27;re wearing some fake police chief sign doesn&#x27;t give you the right to arrest anybody...!<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> ...It does, actuallyy. In the case that a culprit is caught in the act or fleeing from the crime, a police chief or deputy chief for the day has the right to arrest.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> W-We do!?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> I had no idea.<br>
<strong>Police Officer:</strong> Thanks for even going so far as arresting them. Still, I&#x27;m surprised you knew you had the right to do that.<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> Welll... I only just learned about it too.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> You just found out? When?<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> When they told us about today&#x27;s assignment, I looked it up when they gave us time to change.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Wow! So you did some research thinking something like this might happen? Nice going!<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> ...No, it&#x27;s not like I had any idea this would happenn. I just thought, having someone who didn&#x27;t know their role in the ceremony would be too inefficient...<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> I looked up a lot of things, to see if I could help with somethingg.<br>
<strong>Police Officer:</strong> You&#x27;re something else! We really lucked out, getting a girl like you to come by.<br>
<strong>Police Officer:</strong> Alright, the rest of us on the scene will take care of the culprit, so you can go on back to the parade.<br>
<strong>Police Officer:</strong> And, once you&#x27;re done there, I hear offers have been pouring in from all around the station for you, so I hope you&#x27;re feeling ready to give it your best effort.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Gehh, I thought this whole mission was just for show; there&#x27;s more work we&#x27;ve gotta do...?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> The two of us can&#x27;t stand by letting Hirona show us up. Let&#x27;s do everything we can to help out for today!</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations/edit/docs/Tojitomo_Police_Duty.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_2_ui" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_3DPF"></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"></div></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_35-E thin-scrollbar"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#1-helping-out-at-the-police-station" class="table-of-contents__link">1: Helping Out at the Police Station!?</a></li><li><a href="#2-the-campaign-involves" class="table-of-contents__link">2: The Campaign Involves...!?</a></li><li><a href="#3-who-will-prove-themselves" class="table-of-contents__link">3: Who Will Prove Themselves?</a></li><li><a href="#4-toji-vs-speeding-violation" class="table-of-contents__link">4: Toji VS Speeding Violation!?</a></li><li><a href="#5-making-up-for-it-with-our-last-assignment" class="table-of-contents__link">5: Making Up for It With Our Last Assignment!?</a></li><li><a href="#6-another-call-from-the-police-station" class="table-of-contents__link">6: Another Call from the Police Station!?</a></li><li><a href="#7-go-forth-police-chief-and-deputies-for-the-day" class="table-of-contents__link">7: Go Forth!
