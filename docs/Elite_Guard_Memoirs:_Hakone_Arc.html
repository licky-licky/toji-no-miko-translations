Hey, can't we all go to some hot springs together?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> That sounds nice, hot springs. We've been working nonstop lately, so a chance to let our hair down would be much appreciated.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> There's no way all four of us can take a trip at once. Who's going to guard Yukari-sama then?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I know that. It's only wishful thinking. You take everything so seriously, Maki-san.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Oh, you weren't serious? ...Still, it would be good if we could visit hot springs together.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> What if we say it's for an elite guard training camp? Then Yukari-sama will take us and we can all go to the hot springs! Like in Hakone!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> That's an unrealistic plan.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> ...Wait? Didn't all four of us go to a hot spring in Hakone before?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> We did. If I remember right, it was around when the elite guard was still being formed, shortly after Yume joined.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Back then we were elite guard in name only. We weren't used to each other yet, so it was disgraceful the way we struggled with each other.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Especially on that day. Just thinking about it makes my cheeks burn red.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Though it's thanks to that incident that we began mutually respecting each other's ability--  </p><h2 id="2-in-the-past-aradama-eradication-operation" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>2: In the Past: Aradama Eradication Operation</h2><p><strong>Yukari:</strong> --Maki, Suzuka. This time, I'll have you two aid in an operation to eliminate aradama located in Hakone.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> The scale of this operation will be greater than anything you two have been assigned since the formation of the elite guard.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> To that end, I've arranged for many toji to be under your command. All the equipment and rations you should need have been prepared as well.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Thank you for trusting me with such an important mission.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I'll see to it that this operation is carried out without fail.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> --So then, Maki-san. Were you planning on leading the charge again?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Of course. Having the captain at the front allows you to react and give orders as fast as possible.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Is that so. However, it's my opinion that a captain should stay behind the unit, to get the clearest picture looking after the whole group.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> But my unit suffers less injuries compared to others. The numbers don't lie.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> That they don't. Then this time, I suppose I'll have to stick close to you and study how you fight.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I might even learn the secret behind your strength for myself, Maki-san.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Do whatever you want. Let's go, there's aradama to cut down! --Haah!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> As I've come to expect, you handle your sword well, Maki-san.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> ---! There's one coming around behind you! I'll dispose of it! Haaaah!!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> -!? Suzuka, you're too close!! Give me more room to fight!!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> I almost hit you when I swung at that aradama!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> What's with your attitude!? I moved in to save you, you know!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> I didn't need your help! Worry about yourself instead of me!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...!! Is that so!! Then the next time you're in a pinch, Maki-san, I'll look the other way!!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Good! That works for me!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Honestly, what is with you...! ...Forget it. I'll return to the rear of the unit, like usual--<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...Eh-!?  </p><h2 id="3-army-of-aradama" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>3: Army of Aradama</h2><p><strong>Suzuka:</strong> We've been completely surrounded by aradama! Just where did they all come from...!?  
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> They can't have been lying in wait for us, can they...?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> It's just a coincidence. Aradama setting up an ambush is unheard of.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...You're right, I'm overthinking it. Aradama don't have the intelligence for it, after all.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Still, this is bad. We've been separated from the rest of the group.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> We need to hurry and regroup--<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Still, against these numbers, reuniting with them won't be easy.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> We need to come up with a plan. But with their attacks coming one after another, it's hard getting a grip on the situation--<br>Approximately six hours after Maki and Suzuka were separated from the rest of the unit.</p><p><strong>Commander A:</strong> What's going on out there!? The amount of aradama hasn't decreased in the slightest!<br><strong>Commander B:</strong> Are Shidou-san and Konohana-san still unaccounted for!?  
<strong>Commander C:</strong> I don't care how big the operation was supposed to be, how can you lose track of two of our top toji like that...!!<br><strong>Commander D:</strong> This shouldn't be possible...!! There's no record of anything like this happening...!!<br><strong>Commander E:</strong> The toji on site are asking for instructions! Can anyone deal with them--<br><strong>Commander B:</strong> What do you want us to say!? Tell them to act at their own discretion!<br><strong>Watanuki Kazumi:</strong> --I've heard that Maki-sama and Suzuka-sama were separated from their unit, but how did this happen!?  
<strong>Commander F:</strong> Those two were fighting in the vanguard, when a sudden swarm of aradama overwhelmed them.<br><strong>Commander F:</strong> Their current whereabouts are unknown. The numbers of aradama in the area are too great to conduct a search.<br><strong>Naeba Wakako:</strong> For both captains to have been isolated by a swarm of aradama, isn't this a complete disaster...!?  
<strong>Kazumi:</strong> It's been six hours already since they began fighting. We need to re-establish contact immediately to get them out of this war of attrition.<br><strong>Kazumi:</strong> Have the toji on site form a rescue party, and search from where those two--<br><strong>Commander F:</strong> On top of the immense numbers of aradama in the area, none of the other toji have experience commanding a unit. They have their hands full just keeping themselves safe.<br><strong>Commander F:</strong> Given their circumstances, they don't have the toji to spare separating into a rescue party.<br><strong>Kazumi:</strong> You can't be serious... Then you plan on leaving Maki-sama out there to die...!?  
<strong>Commander F:</strong> I-I didn't say that... It's just, we have no other options to work with.<br><strong>Wakako:</strong> So you're praying for a miracle that the aradama are dealt with before it's too late...?<br><strong>???:</strong> Don't waste your breath on prayer. Miracles are something we must make for ourselves.<br><strong>Wakako:</strong> -!?

To grip my okatana...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Phone's out of battery... Pant... Pant... Out of water... Out of food...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> If this goes on much longer... We'll...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Since it's come to this... We may as well... Take as many with us...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Make things easier on... The other toji...!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Suzuka... What are you thinking...?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...The same as you, I'd imagine...!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Got it... Suzuka, there's something I have to say.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> When you saved me back then... I shouldn't have been so harsh with you. Sorry.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> -!? ...No, I was acting childish as well...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...Alright. Gather what strength you have left. This is our last dance!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Good...... Then, let's make this count!! URAAAAAAAHHH-!!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> YAAAAAAAHHH-!!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> YOU TWO! I'M HERE TO SAVE YOU!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...Ehh? (Am I hallucinating from the fatigue...!?)<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Sorry we kept you waiting. You're safe now. There's a team of guards close behind us.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> The hero always shows up at the last minute, you know! They're not always a girl though!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> ...Yomi and Yume!? What're you doing here...!?  
<strong>Yomi:</strong> We came to rescue you two, on Yukari-sama's orders.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> That's how it is! --Still, you two got beat up pretty bad, huh!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> You've got a long way to go if all it took was some aradama for you to end up like this, Onee-san~.  
<strong>Maki:</strong> Sh... Shut up...! Did you come here to save us or humiliate us; make up your mind...!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ahaha! Seems like you're feeling better already if you can talk back like that!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Anyway, just leave the rest to me!  </p><h2 id="5-origami-yukaris-might" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>5: Origami Yukari's Might</h2><p>Several hours before Yomi and Yume met up with Maki and Suzuka.</p><p><strong>Commader A:</strong> The aradama are gathering their numbers!

Yukari-sama has arrived here at Operations Headquarters! Just hold on a little longer! Hang in there!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> ...Hmm.<br><strong>Kazumi:</strong> ...Excuse me, Yukari-sama. Thank you, for forming a rescue party.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Maki and Suzuka are both very valuable. I wouldn't allow them to be lost here.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> --Yomi, Yume. Continue forward, suppressing all aradama in your way. Rescue Maki and Suzuka.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> --Yes. Please count on us.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> This'll be a piece of cake for me~.

You can use that to find allies too, huh!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Since we know where we're going, I won't get lost! So let's push on ahead!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> No, we need to maintain this pace with the rest of the unit--<br><strong>Yume:</strong> The sun'll set if we go as slow as them! Do you want those two to die before we get there!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ...Understood. Then, please clear a path for the others to follow, Tsubakuro-san.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Roger that~! Then, just follow me-! Take that-! Ahahaha! I keep cutting and cutting and there's still more of them!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Haaah! I won't allow you to interfere with our mission!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> By the way, you're pretty good for being able to keep up with me, Onee-san.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> What was your first name again, anyway?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ...I introduced myself earlier, but it seems you forgot...<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> It's Yomi. My name is Satsuki Yomi.<br><strong>Kazumi:</strong> Despite the number of aradama, they're progressing so quickly...!! The elite guard are on another level...!!<br><strong>Wakako:</strong> At this rate, they'll find Suzuka-sama before sunset, won't they!!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> ......Yomi, Yume. Stay on guard as you advance.  </p><h2 id="7-escape-from-the-brink-of-death" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>7: Escape from the Brink of Death</h2><p><strong>Yume:</strong> --So we kept on going like Yukari-sama told us to, and then we found you two!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Yukari-sama's directions were always on the mark.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> ...Is that, so...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> All of you... Thank you... Very much...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Hmmm? Are you two feeling pretty tired?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> They were fighting for nearly half a day. I think this goes beyond being tired.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> That's... Right. For a while now, my arms and legs have gone numb.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I suppose this is what they mean by "on your last legs".<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Really! Then you should just rest here and watch as I finish off the aradama!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ahahahaha! Take this-!!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ...Tsubakuro-san. Our mission was to rescue those two. There's no need to fight these aradama.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> But I want to have some more fun! Don't be such a spoilsport, Yomi onee-san!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ...Understood. It could make extraction difficult if we were attacked from the rear, so let's first eliminate all the aradama in the area.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Yaay! That's more like it! Get ready, cause here I come-!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I simply destroy. --Haah!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> ...They're impressive, Yomi and Yume.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yes... They saved us...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> ......<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> ......<br><strong>Maki:</strong> ...Haha.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...Fufufu.  </p><h2 id="8-everyone-in-the-hot-springs" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>8: Everyone in the Hot Springs!</h2><p><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Ahh... The water's nice... I feel like I've passed on to heaven...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> The hot springs after crossing the verge of death are something else...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> I really thought it was the end for us when we were surrounded by those aradama.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I doubt we'd still be around if Yomi and Yume hadn't arrived when they did.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I have to thank you all; without you I'd never be able to relax in the hot springs like this.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Hmph...! Hmmmph~!!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...Yume?　What are you groaning about?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Your boobs are all too big, Onee-sans!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> -!? Wh-Where did that come from!?  
<strong>Yume:</strong> Suzuka onee-san and Yomi onee-san both are like grown up ladies!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> But even Maki onee-san, who acts like a boy, is way bigger than I thought... I wanna get that big too already...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Hahaha... You know, even when you grow up, they might stay small.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> That's not gonna happen! I'm gonna keep on growing!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ...If they stay small, you could try surgery.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Don't give her such terrible advice, Yomi!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ...By the way, you two are tired, aren't you? I can wash your backs for you.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Will you? To tell the truth, my arms are at their limit after all that fighting. It would be a great help...<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Leave it to me.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Then I'll wash Maki onee-san's back!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Thanks, if you could. ...You're the only ones I'd trust my back to.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Fufu... Maki-san, that phrase is a bit of an exaggeration in this situation, don't you think?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Pff, you're right about that.
