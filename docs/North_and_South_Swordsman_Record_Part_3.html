Pretty Motivated, Aren't They?</h2><p><strong>Yomi:</strong> From here, you will be organized into units formed by two or three groups from the earlier practice... and undertake this mission in Harajuku.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> These may be hasty arrangements, but... I ask you all for your support.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...The silver lining is this happened while we were here training. With all these people, we can take care of it quick.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm... I want to show what we've learned from training.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Ahhh... Even though the training was hard, I thought we wouldn't be in any danger at least...<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Ah--!?  
<strong>Suu:</strong> With all these amazing people here, do they really need me? They don't need me, do they!<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> That won't do. This is your mission too, so you need to handle it properly.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> But I think I'm definitely not needed here... Sigh... It's scary; I don't want to fight any aradama.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I understand the way you're feeling. Me too... I don't want to have to fight if I can help it.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> ...Musumi-san!<br><strong>Suu:</strong> (They give me support and they help me out; maybe I can depend on people from Heijou...?)<br><strong>Suu:</strong> I'll keep being in your care then!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Nn? ...Mmhm, likewise.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Shichinosato-san, I'm relying on you to get me aradama data.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Yeah, count on it.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> (Ah... Thinking about this the other way around, with all these strong people here, doesn't that make this a really safe mission?)<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Shichinosato-san's started looking all excited too.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That's usually how she is before we go on a mission.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> You better be letting me play with some aradama-chan tough enough to be worth it, okay?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> No need to worry about that. We're expecting a lot from the group with you, Itomi, and Juujou.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> The site you're going to has a high number of outbreaks.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Understood.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Ahhhhh... Why do you want to go to the most dangerous places?<br><strong>Suu:</strong> (I just don't get it... Are Shichinosato-san and Itomi-san actually space aliens or something...?)<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> Don't make that face. If it comes down to it, I'll be there to save you.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Hokuto-san... I won't leave your side!!<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> Then we wouldn't be able to fight, would we...?<br><strong>Suu:</strong> ...Are you feeling that motivated for this?<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> I am. It's rare to join a mission alongside a select group of top fighters. There's nothing to dislike about it.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I am feeling a little nervous, but let's try our best to keep up, Asahina-san, Inami-san.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> Of course. It looks like we're about to start. Let's go.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Ahhh~...  </p><h2 id="2-thats-why-i-said-i-didnt-want-to-do-this" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>2: That's Why I Said I Didn't Want to Do This...</h2><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> YAAH!<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> Leave the smaller sized aradama to us. Could you handle that big aradama!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Don't worry about any coming up behind you, Itomi-san, Juujou-san.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Got it. Let's go, Sayaka.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm... We'll finish this quickly.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> What's wrong, what's wrong!<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> GUOOOOOO...!!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Oh! Looks like you wanna keep going; so I'll play with you!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It feels like more and more aradama keep coming here...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Kofuki-san, if it's possible, let's try sticking close together to fight!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah, she ran off. Please come baaaack!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Just gimme a minute.<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> ...GUGGGI!<br><strong>Suu:</strong> ...Waaahh!? They came this way!?  
<strong>Suu:</strong> I feel like I'm in danger; I'm running away!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Not you too, Inami-san!? There's still aradama that way!<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> ......<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> This's it for you--<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Save me... pleaseeeeee...!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Huh!? Hey... You're getting in the way of the good part!<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Buttt...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Well, I'll give you credit for bringing me more aradama-chan at least!<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> ...GGGII!<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Eeeeeek!?  
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...Inami-san!? Whatever you do, keep your utsushi up!<br>Elsewhere, Hokuto and the others were--</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Things are taken care of over here.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> It was a real help having you handle the aradama following the big one around, Asahina-san, Ban-san.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm... We could focus on it thanks to you and Tsugumi.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> No need to thank us. It's our mission.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> I only did what I was capable of.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> (Itomi Sayaka, Juujou Hiyori... They really are strong.)<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> (It's not that I think I'll get the chance to become that strong just by completing missions with them, but, a toji's strength... There might be no limit to it.)<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> (Though... Why are there this many talented individuals in one group to begin with?)<br><strong>Screaming Voice:</strong> EEEEEEKK!?  
<strong>Screaming Voice:</strong> SOMEBODY HELP MEEEEEEEEEE...!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Just now; that's...!<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> ...It's Suu. Let's hurry.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Musumi-san... Shichinosato-san! I'm begging you... I'm begging you, so... Hurry!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> There's still way more aradama-chan to go through, so sit put!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Inami-san, you reapplied utsushi just now, didn't you? That makes the third time... There aren't a lot of toji who can reuse utsushi that much.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> We came to save you, but, you seem okay...?<br><strong>Suu:</strong> I'm not okay at all... At all!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I saw you reapply utsushi just now. You can still fight.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> I've been in a huge pinch this whole time!<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> She can still fight. Suu can use utsushi even more than this.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Why are you telling them that!?  
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> That's amazing...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> In that case, you can keep on being aradama bait for me!<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Ehhhhh!?  
<strong>Aradama:</strong> ......<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Certain data does indicate that aradama also tend to attack weaker seeming targets. Though it's still in need of verification.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Don't just decide that on your own...!! I'm not an aradama charmer, okay!?  
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> You don't need to worry. We'll protect you, Suu.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Th-Thank you very much!<br><strong>Suu:</strong> But still, I want you to save me right now! Get me out of this situation...!  </p><h2 id="3-if-possible-id-like-a-break-from-missions-for-a-while" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>3: If Possible... I'd Like a Break From Missions for a While</h2><p><strong>Suu:</strong> Eep!?  
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Are you doing alright-?<br><strong>Suu:</strong> I just got a little spooked by the sound of okatana hitting an aradama...<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Even though I realize everyone's getting rid of the aradama.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I see. Though, Inami-san, it seems like you can use utsushi a great number of times, so if you were able to overcome your fears facing aradama, it would be very unlikely you would get hurt.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Thinking about it is one thing, but actually doing it is a whole different story.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I understand. Raw data gathered from aradama will be biased, so it's vital to see the aradama moving about up close like this as well.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Today is looking to be an auspicious day, with all the aradama I've gotten to see and the data to collect.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Ah.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> (This person too... She's dangerous after all!)  
<strong>Suu:</strong> (I don't know how many times I've thought this now, but... Let this be over already-!)  
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I'm leading this aradama over towards you!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Sure! Don't worry about beating 'em, just keep sending more and more aradama-chan my way!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> We're only doing it like this for today, okay?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> I'm more than happy to do this anytime though.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> Shichinosato-san! Would it be alright for me to send one more aradama at you then?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> I'll take any of them you've got!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Step right up, fresh aradama-chan!<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> (We weren't at all able to reach the coordination we were working towards during practice, in the end.)<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> (With Shichinosato-san, we could hardly even take a formation.)<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Honestly... You're only paying attention to the aradama that come right in front of you.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> (But outside of practice, Shichinosato-san is like a different person.)<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> (And Musumi-san, understanding her nature, smoothly supports her while fighting the aradama.)<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> I can't let myself lose here either... can I.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Great work, everyone-. Today was a little rough on us, huh.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Were you in charge of leading a different group, Iwakura-san?<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Mmhm. I was working together with the people from my group to stop the aradama from leaving the predicted area, and also helping escort anyone who couldn't evacuate on time.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I wouldn't really be able to do that.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Everyone has their own role. I wouldn't be able to fight like you can either, Itomi-san.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Sayaka. Since there were so many aradama, you must have taken out a lot of them, right?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I stopped remembering how many halfway.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> If we're comparing numbers, you would have gotten the most, wouldn't you?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Probably-. I got to play with so many aradama-chan I couldn't even keep up counting, so I'm satisfied.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> I've got her to thank for that too.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> Suu wouldn't feel so fortunate though... You really do love to fight aradama, don't you.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> I can't overlook that you ignored both orders and the unit's formation, but adaptability is a necessity, and I admire your dedication to the mission.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> I suppose it's fine so long as you don't cause any trouble for the girls you're assigned to work with.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Heh, Kiyoka can handle it so it's all good.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> I don't know how many times I thought I was going to die today... I mean it, I'm on my last legs.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> Though, since you weren't hurt in the end, it turned out fine.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> No way; this time was bad enough that I want a special vacation or something. My heart took more than enough damage!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> What's this? I'd heard Inami was about to drop from exhaustion, but you look lively enough to me.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Shidou-san!? D-Did you need something from us?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Nothing in particular. Just checking in on the toji who took part in the mission.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> You elite guard must have had your hands full too. Though, there's something on my mind. Mind if I ask you?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Go right ahead.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> Whichever way you look at it, don't you think the group Suu and I were put in had an excessive amount of fighting strength?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Ahh, that's what you mean. The plan was always to make one team of more average ability and one with more capable fighters.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Just in order to counter any powerful aradama that appeared. On top of that, there were a lot of unique individuals, so it was Suzuka's thinking that having them all in one place would make them easier to manage.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> ...Because of that, we had a lot of trouble.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> And I... I ended up being some kind of aradama bait... It was the worst.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> ...That must have been difficult. Though, while the average level of students chosen for this training was high, not many could keep up with that group you were in.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Knowing you two, I suggested you. And, it doesn't look like I was wrong.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Sigh... Just because I can use utsushi a little more than usual, I wish you wouldn't forget how weak I am...<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I... I want to see how many times you can apply utsushi.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> I-Itomi-sama!? How long have you been here for!?  
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Not long. I saw you from the front entrance.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> But, why are you using "sama"? I'm... not that important.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Itomi-sama... You're way too strong, aren't you... So that's why!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> There are toji stronger than me. ...You can call me Sayaka.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> No no no... There's no way I could say your name that bluntly! At least let me use Sayaka-san!!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Alright. And... How many more times can you apply utsushi, Suu? I want to see.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> How many more times...? I'm all out of stock for today, so I can't show you any more utsushis!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> That's a shame...<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> But, we go to the same school. I'll look forward to when we go on missions together.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> It's not like it's any fun to see either...<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> ......<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Hokuto-san, why do you look like you're enjoying this. You're a bully.<br><strong>Hokuto:</strong> That's not what I was smiling about.
