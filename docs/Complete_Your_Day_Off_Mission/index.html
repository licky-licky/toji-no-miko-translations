<strong>Yume:</strong> Got it! Are we doing anything interesting this time? Hurry up and let me see, Maki onee-san!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Last month we had fairly packed schedules; it was hard enough to find half a day to rest. How does it look this time?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> It&#x27;s another pretty busy month, but it&#x27;s arranged so each of us gets full days off at least.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I&#x27;ll send you all the data so you can go over it yourselves.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Thank you.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> It&#x27;s true, there&#x27;s just enough gaps between missions for some time to ourselves.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> So I get this day off, and this one too~? Huh? Suzuka onee-san, don&#x27;t we have the same day off?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Would you look at that; that&#x27;s quite the coincidence.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Then, we should go play somewhere together!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I&#x27;d be glad to. It&#x27;s rare for our time off to match up like this, so we should take advantage of the opportunity.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I can&#x27;t wait~! Maki onee-san, and Yomi onee-san too, if you have the same day off you should come with us!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Well, there&#x27;s no way our schedules would line up that conveniently...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> That&#x27;s strange, I have the same day off...<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I do too...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Hooray~! Now we can all go out together! This is the best! This is the best!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> We never get the same day off like this, so what happened here...?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yukari-sama must be planning something.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Don&#x27;t think so hard about it, onee-sans~! We all got the day off together, so we should just have fun with it.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> In any case, I&#x27;m going to confirm with Yukari-sama that this wasn&#x27;t some mistake.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> All of you have the same day off?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Yes. Since we don&#x27;t get much time off, I&#x27;d think all of us getting the same day would never happen.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I was wondering if you were planning something by this, Yukari-sama...<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> I don&#x27;t recall making any specific order here. Isn&#x27;t it just that all of you happened to be without missions that day?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> It&#x27;s true that all of us should have our work done for the time being that day...<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Then that day is simply the most efficient time to give all of you a break.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> See, see~? I said you were overthinking it, didn&#x27;t I?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Oh yeah! Can you take that day off too, Yukari-sama? Then we can all have fun together!<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Unfortunately, I have a pile of duties steadily accumulating that need to be dealt with. You&#x27;ll all have to enjoy yourselves without me.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Well that sucks~. But at least the four of us are together, right!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yes, I&#x27;m glad we could clear up that it wasn&#x27;t all some big mistake at least. Though...<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Will it really be alright for all of us to be absent on the same day?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> We can have our time off whenever, so wouldn&#x27;t it be best if we adjusted the schedule now?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh, but I thought we were all going to go hang out together...<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Wait, there&#x27;s no need for you to change your schedule. If you go making adjustments without good reason, it would throw other people&#x27;s plans into disarray.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Since you have no work to do, you should enjoy your time off. So long as you fulfill the obligations you&#x27;re given, you have nothing to worry about.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Y... Yes ma&#x27;am.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ...Yukari-sama might have said all that, but I&#x27;m still not sure about this.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Yaaay! Yukari-sama said it&#x27;s okay, so we&#x27;re all gonna go play together, right!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Well, we did get approval from Yukari-sama... And it would be nice for all the elite guard to spend time together.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> You&#x27;re right, you never know if we&#x27;ll see another chance like this.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Alright-! So let&#x27;s think of where we&#x27;re going!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ...  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="2-you-have-the-day-off"></a>2: You Have the Day Off?<a class="hash-link" href="#2-you-have-the-day-off" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>On the day everyone had off--</p><p><strong>Yume:</strong> Maki onee-san, Suzuka onee-san! They&#x27;re starting the line for the roller coaster! We should get up in front.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Don&#x27;t run like that, Yume. It&#x27;s dangerous.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I&#x27;ll be fine-! Who do you think I am!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> There sure are a lot of people who came to the amusement park today, aren&#x27;t there?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I know, it&#x27;s already so crowded. If only Yomi had come along with us...<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Hm? Yomi, don&#x27;t you have the day off?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Yukari-sama. Good work. Is something wrong?<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> To begin with, Yomi, I&#x27;m talking about you. What are you doing here?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes, I was doing my usual duties, reviewing paperwork that needs to be settled...<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> I&#x27;d heard Maki and the others went to an amusement park. You didn&#x27;t go with them?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> They did invite me, but I remembered I still had paperwork to take care of.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Approved, unapproved... Approved...<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> That paperwork, it&#x27;s not something that needed doing right now, was it?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> No...<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Then, on your day off, when your comrades invited you out, why would you refuse them and force yourself back to work?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> That&#x27;s because...<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Yukari-sama. I appreciate your consideration for allowing all of us to take the day off at once... However, I can&#x27;t bring myself to leave the Origami household without any members of the elite guard.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Is that something you discussed with the others before deciding?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> No... They looked so happy planning where to go on their day off that I couldn&#x27;t bring it up, so I told them I remembered I still had work left to do.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> I see. Yomi, your devotion to your duties is one of your admirable qualities, however...<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> How about this. I have an assignment for someone as dedicated as you that needs to be taken care of today.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Understood, I&#x27;ll do whatever you ask of me.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> In that case, take the day off at once.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Eh...?<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Making use of the breaks in your work to rest is an invaluable part of self-management. Your mission today is to enjoy your day off to the fullest.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> But, Yukari-sama...<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Put away those papers at once, and begin your mission. That&#x27;s all I have to say.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Yukari-sama! ...She&#x27;s gone.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Yukari-sama gave me this mission, so I have to carry it out, but how...?  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="3-yomis-day-off"></a>3: Yomi&#x27;s Day Off<a class="hash-link" href="#3-yomis-day-off" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Yomi:</strong> Enjoy my day off to the fullest... That&#x27;s what Yukari-sama told me, but what does that mean, and where could I do it...?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Ah, that&#x27;s right. If I join Shidou-san and the others, who should still be at the amusement park, Yukari-sama must be able to accept that.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> First, to see if joining them is still a possibility. I&#x27;ll call Shidou-san.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> She won&#x27;t pick up... In that case, someone else...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Hey heyyy~! Yomi onee-san? It&#x27;s Yume!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Tsubakuro-san, I wanted to talk to Shidou-san...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Maki onee-san went to go buy some ice cream. Get this, I&#x27;m about to ride a roller coaster with Maki onee-san and Suzuka onee-san!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I&#x27;m glad you&#x27;re having a good time. When Shidou-san gets back, could you please tell her to call...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ah, she&#x27;s back! I&#x27;ll put her on!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Hello, Yomi? Sorry I couldn&#x27;t get back to you. This place has been packed all morning. I wish you could&#x27;ve been here with us.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Anyway, what&#x27;s the matter? Did something come up with work?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> No, it&#x27;s not like that...<br>
<strong>Public Announcement:</strong> Sorry to report... ber of visitors... restricting entry... der of the day...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Oh, huh...<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> What was that?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> It&#x27;s nothing. I was just thinking it was so crowded today, when they announced they&#x27;re restricting entry from now on.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> They&#x27;re... Restricting entry?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Ah, I think Suzuka has something she wants to ask you. I&#x27;m putting her on.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Hello, it&#x27;s me. Yomi, which do you prefer, chocolates or cookies?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I don&#x27;t mind either of them...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> When you answer like that, it only makes this decision harder... The souvenir shop here has all sorts of delicious looking sweets.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> It&#x27;s a shame you aren&#x27;t with us, Yomi. We could have had fun picking them out together.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Oh, it&#x27;s our turn to get on the ride, so I&#x27;ll have to hang up now. We&#x27;ll buy you souvenirs on our way back, so do your best at work, Yomi.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ......If they&#x27;re restricting entry, I won&#x27;t be able to join them at the amusement park, will I...<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> In that case, where could I go to enjoy my day off to the fullest...?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Now that I think about it, I was never taught how to spend free time... What do I do...<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> If I look into it at the library, I might be able to find a book that can help.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Ways to spend free time... Ways to spend free time...<br>
<strong>Passing Toji A:</strong> Hey, next time we get a day off, wanna stop by Harajuku?<br>
<strong>Passing Toji B:</strong> Sounds good. Harajuku it is~!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> (I see, Harajuku...? I remember other toji often talking about having fun during their time off there.)<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> (If I go to Harajuku, I might find a way to enjoy my day off to its fullest. I should go now, for the sake of my mission...)<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Sigh, I&#x27;ve finally arrived. This is my first time coming here outside of suppressing aradama. It&#x27;s crowded during normal hours.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Now that I&#x27;m here to enjoy Harajuku on my day off... What exactly should I be doing...?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Heyy, good looking~! Is something bothering you? Why don&#x27;t I show you a good time~!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> A good time? Are you talking to me?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ah-! You&#x27;re from the elite guard... Satsuki Yomi-san!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> My bad! You know me, as soon as I see some cute girl I can&#x27;t help myself. I had no idea you were one of the elite guard...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I&#x27;m really sorry about this! Anyway, I&#x27;ll leave you alone now...<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Please wait. Weren&#x27;t you going to show me a good time?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Eh?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> In that case, by all means, let me accompany you.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> EHHHH-------------!!!!!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="4-yuis-day-off-lessons"></a>4: Yui&#x27;s Day Off Lessons<a class="hash-link" href="#4-yuis-day-off-lessons" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Yomi:</strong> That is, will you teach me the fundamentals of &quot;a good time in Harajuku&quot;?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> You should loosen up first, Satsuki-san!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I&#x27;m sorry. I don&#x27;t have a good understanding of what it means to spend free time.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> If you don&#x27;t mind, I want to join you on my day off and have you teach me how to enjoy Harajuku. Would that be acceptable?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Hnnng, I couldn&#x27;t be happier, getting a request like that! Of course I&#x27;m okay with it! It&#x27;s my lucky day, taking Satsuki-san on a date around Harajuku~!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I&#x27;ll give you the full tour, so you can see exactly how I get the most out of Harajuku~!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I&#x27;ll be in your care. What should we be doing first...?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> When it comes to Harajuku, the thing that stands out most is crepes!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I&#x27;ve heard about those before...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> And observing cute girls eating them!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Observing...? Is that right...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Of course! We shouldn&#x27;t waste any more time! Let&#x27;s head to where they&#x27;re selling some~!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Okay, now we&#x27;ll begin our lookout in front of that crepe stand!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Understood. When it comes to observing girls eating crepes, what should I be looking for specifically...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Just trust in your instincts, and when you see a girl who grabs your attention, look verrry closely at her behavior and expressions!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> My instincts... I see.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ah-, that one&#x27;s so cute! No, wait! Her friend next to her&#x27;s good looking too~. I don&#x27;t believe it, are they twins~? That&#x27;s adorable~!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Stare...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> So what do you think, Satsuki-san? Can&#x27;t get enough of those glittering &quot;Which crepe should I eat&quot; eyes, can you~?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Just seeing that is enough to keep me coming back to Harajuku!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I see, their eyes were glittering? Understood, I&#x27;ll focus on that point from now on. Is there anywhere else I should pay attention to...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Let&#x27;s see~, for example... Like if you see a cool looking girl suddenly start passionately explaining the appeal of chocolate mint, while she licks away at it!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Getting to see that kind of gap in attitude is the real thrill of coming to a crepe stand!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> The enjoyment of witnessing the moment schoolgirls categorize their tastes, contradicting your expectations... Am I understanding it?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Mmm~, you don&#x27;t have to make it sound so complicated, or even really understand it. Just so long as it makes you feel good, it&#x27;s all alright!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> To be honest, I can&#x27;t seem to find the same excitement in this as you can, Yamashiro-san. But in order to make a meaningful report to Yukari-sama, I&#x27;ll try my best.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ahaha, you&#x27;re so weird, Satsuki-san! I know! To celebrate us meeting up today, how about I buy you a crepe?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Sorry that took a minute. Here you go! I only have pocket change on me, so I had to buy the cheapest cream crepe though.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Thank you for your consideration.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Chew, chew... This is simple, but very delicious.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> That&#x27;s great~. I feel like I&#x27;m dreaming, getting to see Satsuki-san eating up close like this! Ahhh~ I&#x27;m being healed~.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> This is what time off is all about! Thanks to you, I had the best vacation. Now I&#x27;m refreshed and ready to give my all starting tomorrow!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> (Yamashiro-san seems to have fully enjoyed her day off, but is this actually what Yukari-sama asked me to do...?)  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="5-help-arrives"></a>5: Help Arrives!<a class="hash-link" href="#5-help-arrives" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Yui:</strong> Satsuki-san, it&#x27;s time for the next attraction: observing the girls standing in line at the bubble tea stand! Let&#x27;s go!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Understood.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> You know, with the streets this packed, there&#x27;s cuties every where you turn. Fun huh~.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> (I&#x27;m not sure if the way Yamashiro-san enjoys her day off will satisfy what Yukari-sama asked of me...)<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Wait-! Those two cute girls that were together just now...<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Ah, Yamashiro-san, please don&#x27;t leave me behind.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Sayaka-chaaan! Mai-chaaaan!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Yui.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Fancy running into you here.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I know, it&#x27;s like I won the lottery today~! I&#x27;m about to start tearing up! So, so? What&#x27;re you two doing in Harajuku?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Sayaka-chan and I had the day off, so we thought we&#x27;d go shopping here.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> We drank bubble tea too.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Nnn~ I can&#x27;t get enough of it~ This &quot;girls day out&quot; feeling! I can&#x27;t believe I also managed to run into you two today~.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Also...?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Good, I caught up with you. Yamashiro-san, why did you run away?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Satsuki Yomi...<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Yanase-san and Itomi-san.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> You two are an unusual pair. What were you up to?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Today, I was having Yamashiro-san teach me meaningful ways to spend my day off.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Teaching you how to spend your day off...?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Satsuki-san said she wanted to know how to have fun in her free time, so I&#x27;m coaching her in my way of enjoying Harajuku to the fullest~.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Coaching? What did you teach her? I want to know too.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Stuff like sitting in front of a crepe stand and observing the cute girls going by!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Observing...?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I learned to watch a person&#x27;s eyes as they make purchases. And that it&#x27;s essential to measure the gap in deviation between a person&#x27;s style and their tastes.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> There&#x27;s no better way to spend your day off than joining a cute girl to watch cute girls, don&#x27;t you think~?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I-I guess that&#x27;s one way to spend it...<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Satsuki Yomi, did you have fun doing that?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I&#x27;m diligently trying to. But I&#x27;m still unfamiliar with spending time off.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> I don&#x27;t think... That&#x27;s how people normally spend their day off.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> That isn&#x27;t normal?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Huhhhh? You&#x27;re kidding? I do this stuff for fun practically every day though...<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> If what Yamashiro-san does in her free time isn&#x27;t normal, then what does a normal day off consist of...?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Satsuki-san, I&#x27;m sorry! I was having the best time with you, but I think I might&#x27;ve not really been all that helpful?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Um, if you don&#x27;t mind, why don&#x27;t the four of us enjoy ourselves together?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Could I join you?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> If Mai says so, we&#x27;ll do it.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Eh, no way-! Somebody pinch me! I&#x27;m surrounded by cute girls!

<strong>Mai:</strong> Ah, y-you&#x27;re right... I didn&#x27;t think of it, from that perspective.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Th-Then why don&#x27;t we look in that general store over there? They sell some cute and a little strange mascot accessories. It&#x27;s a popular place.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Wow, look at this! This doll&#x27;s so uglycute~! (dasakawa)<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Aradama!?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> N-No! That&#x27;s not what I said-! Not aradama, da-sa-ka-wa!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Forgive me. To me, it sounded like you said something else.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I guess that&#x27;s proof that your mind is always ready for action. That&#x27;s the elite guard for you...<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> What&#x27;s the matter, you&#x27;re checking your phone. Is someone trying to get in touch with you?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> No, it&#x27;s nothing important.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> In that case, let&#x27;s go to the next store! Forget about your phone!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> You&#x27;re right. Let&#x27;s go.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Satsuki Yomi, you checked your phone again.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I feel like I might receive an urgent message...<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I&#x27;m sorry, it&#x27;s my mission to enjoy my day off to its fullest, but aradama suppression is weighing on the back of my mind...<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Maybe, because things are so busy here in the city, it&#x27;s hard for you to feel at ease?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> What do you mean?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Everyone has different places they feel like they can relax in. In your case, Satsuki-san, if we move somewhere that&#x27;s more rich with nature, you&#x27;ll have a better day off, I think.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I see, a place with more nature? It&#x27;s true that Harajuku is so crowded it&#x27;s difficult for me to calm down. I agree that we should move somewhere quieter.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> In that case, where would be good~? When I think of cute girls in the great outdoors, it&#x27;s gotta be the beach!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Yui, it&#x27;s November...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Shoot. But I wanted to see all of you in swimsuits~.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Huh? What&#x27;re you guys doing all hanging out here?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Whoa! Even Kofuki-san&#x27;s here now! That&#x27;s it! You should come mess around with us, Kofuki-san!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Mess around? I just got done doing that with some aradama-chan, so I&#x27;m headed back to Kamakura.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ehhh, it&#x27;s only noon. What&#x27;s the harm in hanging out with us for a while~?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> The harm&#x27;s that I hate how packed the stations get at night. And the leaves are in their fall colors, so Kamakura gets a ton of sightseers this time of season.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Fall colors! That could do the trick. Why don&#x27;t we all visit Kamakura and go leaf viewing?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> That could be good... I agree with Mai.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Good looking girls under the red leaves! That&#x27;s the kind of scenery you can&#x27;t see any other time of year. I&#x27;m all for this plan~! What about you, Satsuki-san? What do you want to do?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> The Origami estate is in Kamakura, so I knew about the leaves in their fall colors. But the idea of visiting there with the intention of sightseeing is very interesting to me.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> If we leave now, the stations shouldn&#x27;t be crowded. Shichinosato-san, if it&#x27;s not too much of a bother, could you show us some of the best spots to see the leaves?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Huhh? Why do I have to...<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Kofuki. Please.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...Ughhhh... Fine, have it your way. I&#x27;ll show you around.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> But let me say this, I&#x27;m not going anywhere near the usual tourist traps. I find some good places every now and then when I&#x27;m on missions, so that&#x27;s all I&#x27;ll show you.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="7-first-fall-leaf-viewing"></a>7: First Fall Leaf Viewing<a class="hash-link" href="#7-first-fall-leaf-viewing" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Mai:</strong> Wow, it&#x27;s beautiful!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Amazing... The trees are all red.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ooh~, that&#x27;s crazy! It&#x27;s as pretty as a painting! You know your stuff, Kofuki-san!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Right? If I say it&#x27;s good, it&#x27;s good. What do you think, Yomi-senpai?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ..................<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> O-Oi, are you in there? Yomi-senpai?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Ah-, excuse me! I was overwhelmed by the sight of all the leaves.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> This must have always been here in Kamakura, but this is the first time I&#x27;ve felt aware of it...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Gahhh~, I missed it, Satsuki-san losing herself in the fall colors! I&#x27;ll get my camera ready, so please do it again!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ...Even if you ask me to, it&#x27;s difficult to repeat it now.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> In front of a backdrop of autumn leavings, the seductive look of a slightly lost Satsuki-san! This works too~! A rare shot that can only be found this time of year!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Okay, okay~, it&#x27;s your turn now, Mai-chan, Sayaka-chan! Try gathering up the leaves on the ground, and then whooshing them all up in the air~!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Eh? Ummm~... Like, this?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> The leaves falling down... They&#x27;re pretty.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> The ground and the air are filled with such pretty colors. It&#x27;s beautiful.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Mmmm~, that&#x27;s good, that&#x27;s good~! Beautiful leaves and beautiful girls! Kofuki-san, you need to get in here too~!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> No thanks, I&#x27;m fine over here!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> But you know, if you guys are gonna be this happy about it, I guess it was worth getting dragged along.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Oh yeah, Yomi-senpai, you&#x27;re from Renpu too, aren&#x27;t you? Do you know any other good spots?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> That&#x27;s right... There was a place I heard about during my time as a student. It should be around here.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Then, to thank us, you should take us there!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I don&#x27;t think you should tell others to do things as thanks...<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Understood. I&#x27;ll think back and try to lead you there.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> It should be this place.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Wow, it&#x27;s beautiful here too.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Well what do you know, even Yomi-senpai has some good ideas!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I&#x27;m glad to hear everyone likes it.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Please excuse me...<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Satsuki Yomi&#x27;s stomach growls too.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I&#x27;m sorry. Thinking back on it, the only thing I&#x27;ve eaten today was a crepe.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> If I&#x27;d known we could have had a picnic together, I would have made some boxed lunches.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> If I&#x27;d known this would happen, I would have packed rice balls...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Well I thought something like this might happen! So while we were passing the shops just now, I bought some tasty looking stuff!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Hey, nice thinking!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Croquettes, senbei, dango. They all look tasty... Satsuki Yomi, which one do you want?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> In that case, I&#x27;ll take a croquette.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> I want a croquette too! The ones the shops sell here are nice and cold. You&#x27;ve got a good eye, Yui.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Yay~! I got complimented.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Chew, chew... This dango is tasty. Mai, let me try your croquette.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Here, you can have half. Can I try your dango too?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Ahh~, it&#x27;s so good. Compared to eating crepes in Harajuku, this is wonderful in its own way.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes. Eating here, surrounded by beautiful scenery, adds a different flavor than normal.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I&#x27;ve visited this area many times while on missions, but now that I&#x27;m here on my day off, I&#x27;m finding things that make it feel like an entirely different place.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Satsuki Yomi, right now... You&#x27;re enjoying your time off.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ...This is what it means to enjoy your time off... I see, I think I finally understand it.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Everyone, thank you for joining me today.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="8-day-off-report"></a>8: Day Off Report<a class="hash-link" href="#8-day-off-report" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>The day after their time off--</p><p><strong>Maki:</strong> Yukari-sama, thank you for giving us our day off yesterday.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Were all of you able to enjoy yourselves?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Yes. We met at 8:00 am outside the entrance to the Origami estate. Afterward, the three of us moved as a group to...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Maki-san, you aren&#x27;t delivering an aradama suppression report. Why don&#x27;t we hand them their souvenirs before we tell them about our trip?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> For Yukari-sama, we picked out chocolate in the shape of the amusement park mascot. And for Yomi, these cookies.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Thank you.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Yomi onee-san, let me have some of those later.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Didn&#x27;t you buy cookies for yourself, Yume?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> They were too good, so I already ate them all! Anyway, let&#x27;s talk about our trip~. What was your favorite part of the park?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> In my case, I won&#x27;t forget the go kart competition we had.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Maki onee-san was stepping on the gas so hard it sounded like her kart was going to break.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Y-Yume! You didn&#x27;t have to tell them that!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> It was like watching a little kid, the way you kept trying to go faster.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Not you too, Suzuka...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> But I still won in the end. Next time, I wanna race Yukari-sama and Yomi onee-san too!<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Good, I&#x27;m glad to hear you enjoyed yourselves.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> How did you spend your time, Yomi? I heard you didn&#x27;t go to the amusement park.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes. I completed my mission to enjoy my day off to the fullest without incident, and have returned to make my report.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> The details of my report are written in this document, which you can read through if you wish.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Mission?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Report...?<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> ...I see. You recorded not just the beauty of the scenery, but the flavor of the dango. This is a fine report.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Does this satisfy your conditions for my assignment?<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Yes. Admiring the changing of the seasons through observing the fall leaves, and sampling the regional delicacies. I believe you fully enjoyed your day off.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh, you went to see the fall leaves? What the heck, that&#x27;s no fair that only Yomi onee-san got to go! You should&#x27;ve let me go with you~.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Yomi, do you mind if we read through that report too?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> No, go ahead.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Hmm. So this is what you meant by your mission. It sounds like it was a lovely time, going leaf viewing.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Mmhm. Reading over this, it&#x27;s making me wish we had gone to see it too.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> In that case, if we&#x27;re lucky enough to get the same day off again, why don&#x27;t we all go to see the fall colors?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> That sounds like a plan. Another coincidence like this could always come up, even it&#x27;s unlikely.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> When that happens, Yomi onee-san, you have to show us all the prettiest places!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I will. We can all go together next time.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations/edit/docs/Complete_Your_Day_Off_Mission.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_2_ui" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_3DPF"></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"></div></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_35-E thin-scrollbar"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#1-the-elite-guards-time-off" class="table-of-contents__link">1: The Elite Guard&#39;s Time Off</a></li><li><a href="#2-you-have-the-day-off" class="table-of-contents__link">2: You Have the Day Off?</a></li><li><a href="#3-yomis-day-off" class="table-of-contents__link">3: Yomi&#39;s Day Off</a></li><li><a href="#4-yuis-day-off-lessons" class="table-of-contents__link">4: Yui&#39;s Day Off Lessons</a></li><li><a href="#5-help-arrives" class="table-of-contents__link">5: Help Arrives!</a></li><li><a href="#6-another-helper" class="table-of-contents__link">6: Another Helper</a></li><li><a href="#7-first-fall-leaf-viewing" class="table-of-contents__link">7: First Fall Leaf Viewing</a></li><li><a href="#8-day-off-report" class="table-of-contents__link">8: Day Off Report</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Links</div><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://pastebin.com/LdyviZ8Z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Translator anon&#x27;s pastebin<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Site source code<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Built with Docusaurus.</div></div></div></footer></div>
