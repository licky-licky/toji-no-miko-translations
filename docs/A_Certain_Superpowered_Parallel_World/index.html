I&#x27;ve heard you&#x27;ll soon be helping with an experiment to create a new type of metal. Is that true?<br>
<strong>Misaka Mikoto:</strong> Ah, yeah. I&#x27;m surprised you knew.<br>
<strong>Kuroko:</strong> I didn&#x27;t think you interested in those experiments normally.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> Well, it&#x27;s fine every once in a while.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> (There&#x27;s no way I can tell her I got roped in because this company makes collab novelty Gekota merchandise that they don&#x27;t sell anywhere...)<br>
<strong>Konori Mii:</strong> What will they be having you do, Misaka-san?<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> They need a fixed electric current... They asked me to provide an electromagnetic wave. An especially strong one.<br>
<strong>Saten Ruiko:</strong> That sounds like it could be kinda interesting. Can we go along to see?<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> Sure, I think that&#x27;ll be fine?<br>
<strong>Uiharu Kazari:</strong> Saten-san, didn&#x27;t you say you&#x27;d be busy gathering gossip about that urban legend that there&#x27;s a door to another world hidden in some school district?<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> It&#x27;s fine, it&#x27;s fine. Urban legends aren&#x27;t going anywhere!<br>
Visitors (Gallery)</p><p><strong>Mikoto:</strong> HAAAA...!<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> That&#x27;s as incredible of an electric shock as ever, Misaka-san.<br>
<strong>Kazari:</strong> I wonder what the theory is behind creating a new type of metal using electricity, anyway?<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> Beats me? I&#x27;m not all that interested in that stuff.<br>
<strong>Kazari:</strong> Then... Why did you go and say we should come along?<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> Doesn&#x27;t it sound kinda crazy that they&#x27;re making a new type of metal? That&#x27;s why, if we&#x27;re doing it, I want to be there, you know?<br>
<strong>Mii:</strong> It&#x27;s good to have lots of interests. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with those kind of motivations.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> It really is easier getting into the experiment having you all here, as opposed to being surrounded by people I don&#x27;t know.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> So, I&#x27;m glad you came.<br>
<strong>Kuroko:</strong> My very existence... Thinking of that as the source of Onee-sama&#x27;s strength isn&#x27;t so bad.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> Kuroko... Couldn&#x27;t you have phrased that better?<br>
<strong>Kuroko:</strong> I have only stated the truth.<br>
<strong>Shokuhou Misaki:</strong> Honestly... Thanks to you, Misaka-san, the static electricity is making my hair act funny. What a bother.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> Shokuhou Misaki...! What are you doing here!?<br>
<strong>Misaki:</strong> Hmm-, just to see the sights?<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> Whatever... If you&#x27;re going to complain, then just go. I have to do the main experiment in a minute.<br>
<strong>Mii:</strong> Are you two, &quot;friendly enough to fight&quot;?<br>
<strong>Both:</strong> It&#x27;s not like that at all!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="1-our-first-aradama-experience"></a>1: Our First Aradama Experience<a class="hash-link" href="#1-our-first-aradama-experience" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Mikoto:</strong> Ughh... My eyes are stinging. Is everyone okay?<br>
<strong>Kazari:</strong> Yes... I&#x27;m just fine. Are you alright, Saten-san?<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> Somehow-.<br>
<strong>Misaki:</strong> Hang onn, thanks to Misaka-san, my eyes are still burning here?<br>
<strong>Misaki:</strong> Depending on if this clears up, I might have to file a complaint~.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> How is this my fault? All I did was go along with their experiment to create a new kind of metal.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> Saten-san and Uiharu-san are okay too, so you should be fine...<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> Actually, where are Kuroko and Konori-senpai at?<br>
<strong>Kuroko:</strong> The Kuroko you seek is right here, Onee-sama! And, just as you want me, I can be locked in your arms once more!<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> As if!!<br>
<strong>Mii:</strong> Shirai-san. Isn&#x27;t there something we should tell them first?<br>
<strong>Kuroko:</strong> I suppose...<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> Did something bad happen?<br>
<strong>Kuroko:</strong> Your vision still hasn&#x27;t returned to normal, so you may not have noticed, but... This isn&#x27;t where the experiment was taking place.<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> Eh... Then, where are we? Uiharu, can you look it up?<br>
<strong>Kazari:</strong> Just... give me a minute. Huh, I can&#x27;t get it to turn on!?<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> Let&#x27;s just ask someone around here then.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> Excuse me--<br>
<strong>Screaming People:</strong> UWAAHHHHH, ARADAMA!? G-GET OUT OF HERE!!<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> Eh... Wait...<br>
<strong>Misaki:</strong> Maybe it would have been for the best if someone besides Misaka-san had asked them?<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> ...I didn&#x27;t even do anything!<br>
<strong>Mii:</strong> More importantly, &quot;aradama&quot;? I&#x27;m curious what that means.<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> Umm... This is totally just going off my intuition here, but! Maybe they meant that!?<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> ...GUOOOOOOOHHH!<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> Geez... And what&#x27;s this, this weird thing! Let&#x27;s go, Kuroko. Help me out.<br>
<strong>Kuroko:</strong> Of course, I&#x27;ll be right with you, Onee-sama.<br>
<strong>Misaki:</strong> Do your bestt. It&#x27;s times like these we need that barbaric power of yours, Misaka-sann.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> --What do you think about that? I think it would improve the circumstances of toji waiting for aradama to appear.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I see. You make a good point, Yanase.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Sorry to interrupt your meeting.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Kitora? Did you need something?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> This information is still unverified, but we&#x27;ve received a report that a group of citizens are fighting with aradama.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Eh!?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> As time was of the essence, Etou Kanami, Mashiko Kaoru, Setouchi Chie, Shichinosato Kofuki, and Iwakura Sanae have been sent to the scene.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Ordinary citizens, fighting aradama; I can hardly believe it. ...Is there something strange going on? Just to be sure, we should go too.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Still, why would they fight and not run away?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Seriously; those&#x27;re my aradama-chan.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> It&#x27;s probably just some idiots wanting to test their courage. It happens every now and then.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Whatever it is, we have to get there soon!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> I can hear an aradama roaring. It&#x27;s just up ahead!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Whoa, why&#x27;s the air all crackly!?<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> GUGIII...!<br>
<strong>Kuroko:</strong> Onee-sama-! It&#x27;s getting up once again!<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> Seriously... Just how stubborn can they be! I&#x27;m going to hit it one more time!<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> That&#x27;s dangerous; please get back!<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> Huh?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> We&#x27;ll take care of the rest here!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Out of my way! Those&#x27;re all mine--!<br>
<strong>Kuroko:</strong> Er... Who might you be? You aren&#x27;t from Judgement, are you?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Judgement? We&#x27;re toji.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> &quot;Toji&quot;? What&#x27;s that?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> (...They don&#x27;t know what toji are?)<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Putting it simply, we&#x27;re something like experts at suppressing those aradama you&#x27;re fighting.<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> Sorry, we found a lost girl and took her with us, but what should we do about her?<br>
<strong>Mii:</strong> Also, we weren&#x27;t able to access the database to check evacuation guidelines, and we were in trouble since we couldn&#x27;t call for help.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> I understand. I&#x27;ll call someone to help then.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Well, until help shows up, I&#x27;ll guide her to somewhere safe the aradama can&#x27;t get to.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Thank you, Kaoru-san. The rest of you should all hurry to safety as well!<br>
<strong>Kazari:</strong> Why is it that they all have swords... They don&#x27;t seem like some special tool for an ability enhancement test, do they?<br>
<strong>Kuroko:</strong> Though, it looks as if they&#x27;re telling the truth when they say they&#x27;re specialists.<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> GYAAAAAAAA...!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Hey, hey, what&#x27;s wrong? You&#x27;re not gonna satisfy me like that!<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Etou-san, I&#x27;ll drive them over your way!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Sure, I&#x27;m ready whenever!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> HAAA--!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Etou, Mashiko, Iwakura, Shichinosato, Setouchi. Good work on making it here quickly and suppressing them. And then... You girls.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> They&#x27;re kinda weird, aren&#x27;t they? They don&#x27;t know about toji or aradama.<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> That was so cool, the way you were like, whoosh, with your swords! Girls with Japanese swords just have that appeal to them, don&#x27;t they-.<br>
<strong>Kazari:</strong> Saten-san, before you go off like that, we should make sure of what those aradama things were first.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Well, thinking over it, aradama are a sort of false organism created from a fusion of noro, I guess?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Without using the okatana we toji fight with, you won&#x27;t be able to exorcise them. No matter what you attack them with.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> So that&#x27;s why they kept coming back every time I hit them with electric shocks.<br>
<strong>Kuroko:</strong> Still, for Onee-sama, the electromaster, boasted as third rank in Academy City, to be unable to defeat them...<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> There are still some people my esper powers don&#x27;t work on... Very very few of them though.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Esper powers? You mean like, you can use telepathy or control fire, like you see in movies or manga?<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> What are you talking about? It&#x27;s common knowledge that Academy City is working to develop esper powers.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Academy City... Development of esper powers. I find this hard to believe all of a sudden.<br>
<strong>Mii:</strong> Toji, and aradama... It seems there are many things we&#x27;re both unfamiliar with. Perhaps we should start by confirming some things with each other.<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> Ah, before that, shouldn&#x27;t we do the easy thing and all introduce ourselves? If we don&#x27;t, it&#x27;ll get confusing while we&#x27;re talking.<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> I&#x27;m Saten Ruiko, a first year in Sakugawa Middle School! Nice to meet you! Okay, now Misaka-san!<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> I&#x27;m Misaka Mikoto. A second year in Tokiwadai Middle School. Nice to meet you.<br>
<strong>Misaki:</strong> Likewise, second year at Tokiwadai Middle School, Shokuhou Misaki. Misaka-san and I are verrry close~. Good to meet you all~.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> Since when... Could you at least do your introduction right?<br>
<strong>Misaki:</strong> Awww, Misaka-san&#x27;s so scaryy.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> So you two come from the same school. I&#x27;m Etou Kanami, a second year in the Minoseki Academy&#x27;s middle school division. Nice to meet you!<br>
<strong>Kuruko:</strong> Then, I will go next. I am Shirai Kuroko, a first year from Tokiwadai Middle School. And a member of one of Academy City&#x27;s organizations for maintaining public order, Judgement.<br>
<strong>Kuroko:</strong> Ah-! I can&#x27;t believe myself; I nearly forgot to mention something important.<br>
<strong>Kuroko:</strong> I also happen to be Misaka Mikoto-onee-sama&#x27;s roommate at Tokiwadai&#x27;s dorms. Pleased to make your acquaintance.<br>
<strong>Kazari:</strong> ...Leave it to Shirai-san to go out of her way to let people know that.<br>
<strong>Kazari:</strong> Ah. My name is Uiharu Kazari. I&#x27;m a member of Judgment, the same as Shirai-san, and also, a classmate of Saten-san&#x27;s.<br>
<strong>Mii:</strong> Then, it looks like I&#x27;m the last one on our side. I&#x27;m Konori Mii. Good to meet you.<br>
<strong>Mii:</strong> Like Shirai-san and Uiharu-san, I work for Judgement.<br>
<strong>Mii:</strong> Oh, and, come to think of it, I&#x27;m the only one in high school among us.<br>
<strong>Kazari:</strong> She&#x27;s our dependable senpai.<br>
<strong>Mii:</strong> Thank you, Uiharu-san.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Then, we should finish our introductions as well. I&#x27;m Kitora Mirja, second year in the high school division of Ayanokouji Martial Arts School.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="2-tamahagane"></a>2: Tamahagane?<a class="hash-link" href="#2-tamahagane" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Mikoto:</strong> With my power, it&#x27;s like this.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> That&#x27;s so cool, Onee-san! It&#x27;s all sparky and crackly!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> They really do have esper powers.<br>
<strong>Kuroko:</strong> Still, now things are finally clear. This may sound unbelievable, but... We&#x27;ve all arrived in a world without Academy City or esper abilities.<br>
<strong>Mii:</strong> I&#x27;m sorry to ask for this, but is there any way you could provide for us a place to live for the time being?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Of course. I&#x27;m sure you don&#x27;t have anyone else to rely on, so we&#x27;ll arrange a place for you to stay at the nearby Renpu dorms. You don&#x27;t have to worry.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> Thanks a lot. That really helps.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Anyway, Shidou-san. Everyone must be tired, so let&#x27;s move over there.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Now then, could you explain what it was you were all doing just before you came here?<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> Just before we ended up in this world, I was actually helping with an experiment to create a new kind of metal.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> And then, after I made electric current, in just 10 seconds, we were blanketed in this white light...<br>
<strong>Kuroko:</strong> The next thing we knew, we had been transported to this world.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> I guess what sounds reasonable is, this metal you were trying to make might&#x27;ve been the cause?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> What kind of metal was it?<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> Sorry, I don&#x27;t know the details myself...<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> (And that&#x27;s cause, after they said they&#x27;d give me corporate novelty Gekota merchandise... I got too excited and wasn&#x27;t listening.)<br>
<strong>Misaki:</strong> If only Misaka-san would pay more attention to that sort of thingg.<br>
<strong>Misaki:</strong> That side of you can be so childish; it&#x27;s a real botherr.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> Wha!? Listen, you... I do feel a little responsible for this, but... Why&#x27;d you even have to come along in the first place!<br>
<strong>Misaki:</strong> Purely by chance. I just happened to have something to take care of at that research institute too.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Misaka Mikoto, Shokuhou Misaki. We are getting off topic. Is there anything else you can remember?<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> Ah, come to think of it, the metal we were creating, I think they gave it the temporary name &quot;Tamahagane&quot;...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Eh, tamahagane?<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> ...Wait, huh? Is there something about tamahagane?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> It might be a simple coincidence, but our okatana are made from a special iron sand known as tamahagane.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> It&#x27;s a word we&#x27;re a little used to hearing, so I couldn&#x27;t help but react.<br>
<strong>Kazari:</strong> That sure is an interesting coincidence though.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Mind if I butt in for a moment? Looking over the report from the noro recovery team just now, there&#x27;s a detail I&#x27;d better tell you about.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> From the sound of things, they found an unidentified metal mixed in with the samples of noro, though only in small quantities.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> Then... Does that mean what I think it does?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> It&#x27;s not at the point we can speculate yet, but it is concerning.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> In that case, why don&#x27;t we have Ellen-san ask Friedman-san and the Special Rare Metals Utilization Research Institute to look into it?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> This metal mixed in with the noro might be just what Misaka-san is talking about, after all.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> It&#x27;s best to leave what you don&#x27;t get to the professionals.<br>
<strong>Misaki:</strong> What&#x27;s the harm in asking? If they send it back to us, we can&#x27;t do very much investigation ourselves, can we?<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> That&#x27;s right; we&#x27;ll follow any clues we can get. You&#x27;re all okay with that, aren&#x27;t you?<br>
<strong>Mii:</strong> I think that&#x27;s the best option we have available now.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Then, I&#x27;ll get in touch with her right away.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I&#x27;ll get the procedures taken care of then, so the noro can be transported smoothly.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> In the meantime, everyone, would you like to have dinner? With all that&#x27;s happened, I figure you must be hungry.<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> Ah-, that&#x27;d be great. I was starving, actually.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="3-toji-are-highly-busy"></a>3: Toji are Highly Busy<a class="hash-link" href="#3-toji-are-highly-busy" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Several days had passed since Mikoto and the others came to this world.</p><p>They offered to help gather from the aradama the tamahagane metal that their experiment had created.</p><p><strong>Aradama:</strong> GGGIIIII...!!<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> Don&#x27;t go running wild in the middle of town!<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> Gu... Gguu...<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> The aradama&#x27;s movements have slowed. Let&#x27;s finish it off, Iwakura-san!<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Understood! --HAAAAAH!<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Kuroko:</strong> What excellent coordination.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Thanks for the help, Misaka-san.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> You&#x27;re welcome, but, I didn&#x27;t do all that much.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> We&#x27;re plenty glad just to have you stopping their movments. Right?<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Exactly. It buys us time to get people to safety, and it makes it harder for the aradama to fight back. You&#x27;re a huge help.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> I&#x27;m just glad to be able to help somehow. This much is nothing to pay back what you&#x27;ve done for us, so whenever you&#x27;re suppressing them, go ahead and give me a call.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Thank you. Now then, it looks like the noro is finished being recovered too, so why don&#x27;t we head back to Renpu for now?<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> Ah, welcome back, Misaka-san, Shirai-san. You too, Yanase-san, Iwakura-san; good work out there.<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> How&#x27;d it go? The usual metal collection.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> If I had to say one way or the other, it&#x27;s going well. But, it isn&#x27;t as if we&#x27;re gathering lots of metal at once, so it could take a while.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> I guess we have no choice but to go slow and steady. There&#x27;s no use rushing it.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> Though, the aradama... I&#x27;m a little surprised at how often they&#x27;re appearing.<br>
<strong>Kuroko:</strong> They show themselves so many times per day. Working as a toji must be challenging.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> I&#x27;m sorry to have you two come with us to the fighting even though you aren&#x27;t toji yourselves.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> We&#x27;re the ones who said we wanted to come along.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Even so, you shouldn&#x27;t push yourselves, alright? If anything happens, don&#x27;t hesitate to tell your onee-san here.<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> That&#x27;s some impressive broad-mindedness you&#x27;ve got there... But, you won&#x27;t beat out Konori-senpai!<br>
<strong>Mii:</strong> Just what... kind of competition is that?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> By the way, what have you been up to there, Uiharu-san?<br>
<strong>Kazari:</strong> I asked the toji at Renpu to provide me with their data, and did a little looking into the distribution of appearances of aradama containing the newly created tamahagane metal.<br>
<strong>Kazari:</strong> Please take a look. It seems like many of the aradama appearing in Kanto match those cases.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I see; this is a discovery, isn&#x27;t it.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Hardly any were found outside the range of Kanto. We should be able to collect these metals to a more efficient degree using this.<br>
<strong>Kazari:</strong> Sure; I thought I might be able to help out some, so I&#x27;m glad to hear it.<br>
<strong>Misaki:</strong> And I see even more appearing now. There really are too many aradama in this world of yours.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Which toji can be dispatched there fastest...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I&#x27;ll go-. If I leave it to Kuroko-onee-san, she can get me there in an instant, right? I wanna try teleporting!<br>
<strong>Kuroko:</strong> I&#x27;d just like to make one thing clear, I am not an amusement park attraction, understand?<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> Don&#x27;t be like that and let&#x27;s get going, Kuroko! You too, Tsubakuro-san!<br>
<strong>Kuroko:</strong> I suppose there&#x27;s no helping it. Then, let me see the location information of where they appeared.<br>
<strong>Kuroko:</strong> Now then, let&#x27;s go. Are you two prepared?<br>
<strong>Mikoto/Yume:</strong> Anytime!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Hey, take me with you! ...Or they&#x27;re already gone, I guess. Don&#x27;t go stealing my aradama-chan like that.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> No matter how many times I see it, it still surprises me. These esper abilities.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="4-whats-the-reason-for-why-they-gather"></a>4: What&#x27;s the Reason for Why They Gather?<a class="hash-link" href="#4-whats-the-reason-for-why-they-gather" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>And so, by cooperating with the toji, Mikoto and the others steadily gathered the metals the experiment seemed to have created.</p><p><strong>Ruiko:</strong> Everyone&#x27;s out on missions again today, huh.<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> With the aradama showing up every day, it figures they&#x27;d need special schools for raising toji.<br>
<strong>Kazari:</strong> Academy City deals with some incidents of its own, but in this world, these are more like hard to prevent natural disasters.<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> Misaka-san and the others must be working hard too-. Hey, the chocolate mint ice cream they have here might also be pretty good!<br>
<strong>Misaki:</strong> Maybe soo. ...Mm, this is delicious too~.<br>
<strong>Kazari:</strong> Still, doesn&#x27;t it feel a little bad sitting in here eating sweets while all the toji are out working?<br>
<strong>Misaki:</strong> Uiharu-san, you&#x27;re worrying too much~.<br>
<strong>Misaki:</strong> At times like these, the best thing to do is leave it all to those used to big flashy fights, like Misaka-san.<br>
<strong>Misaki:</strong> Besides, if we went to do something we aren&#x27;t used to, we&#x27;d be nothing more than a burden, wouldn&#x27;t we?<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> And also, you&#x27;re already helping out here and there yourself, Uiharu.<br>
<strong>Kazari:</strong> I&#x27;m not doing anything!<br>
<strong>Misaki:</strong> Neither am I, you knoww?<br>
<strong>Kazari:</strong> Ah, Konori-senpai came in with Yanase-san and Iwakura-san.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> There you are. We were thinking of taking a short break. Do you mind if we sit with you?<br>
<strong>Misaki:</strong> Go right ahead-.<br>
<strong>Mii:</strong> What were you three talking about?<br>
<strong>Kazari:</strong> About how, all the toji are still students, but they&#x27;re so responsible. It has to be tough, going out on missions every day.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> It may be difficult, but this is just daily life here in our Japan.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> On top of that, exorcising aradama is an important duty for toji.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> When you all came here and saw aradama for the first time, you tried to protect the people, didn&#x27;t you?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I think that&#x27;s far more incredible. Thanks to you, I&#x27;m sure there were people who could get to safety unhurt.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Yeah. It would be normal for you to run away scared.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> So you were in here, Mai-chan.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Good work suppressing the aradama, you two.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> What are you drinking, by the way, Konori Mii?<br>
<strong>Mii:</strong> Just milk. It doesn&#x27;t seem like you have my favorite brand over here, so I took what I found.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I see. I happen to like milk myself, but I never paid much attention to the brands I drink. You have distinctive tastes.<br>
<strong>Mii:</strong> They aren&#x27;t quite so distinctive as you think.<br>
<strong>Mii:</strong> Anyway, did you find more of that metal during your work today?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Yes. However, it&#x27;s still proving difficult. We seem to need a specific amount to meet our goal, and what we&#x27;ve found is insufficient.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> We got less than I thought... I know you must all want to get home as soon as you can too.<br>
<strong>Misaki:</strong> That&#x27;s nothing for you to feel bad about, Etou-sann. The only reason we can get them in the first place is thanks to you toji.<br>
<strong>Kazari:</strong> That&#x27;s right.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> This is...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Everyone, this is a request for aid from Setouchi Chie, Shichinosato Kofuki, and Mashiko Kaoru&#x27;s group, who were accompanying Misaka Mikoto and Shirai Kuroko today.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> It seems aradama are gathering there one after another, and the situation is urgent.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Let&#x27;s get over there on the double then!<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> There seriously is... just no end to them, is there. What&#x27;s going on?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Business is booming today, huh?<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> I&#x27;m going to shock them into slowing down, so hang o--<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Keep it to yourself!<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> Huh!? What do you mean!?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> There&#x27;s no challenge in playing with aradama-chan after they&#x27;ve been tripped up! You go help Chichie or something.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Come and show me a good time; gimme some fresh aradama-chan!<br>
<strong>Kuroko:</strong> Honestly, what is her problem? Refusing Onee-sama&#x27;s assistance like that.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Sorry about her. She just really loves fighting aradama is all...<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> I&#x27;d be glad for anything you can do to make things easier. Just keep making &#x27;em sit still over here, Mikoto.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> And then Chie&#x27;ll take care of them all.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> You&#x27;ll be helping too, Kaoru-san.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> Then, this&#x27;ll sting--<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> ......!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> These ones are still squirming around.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> ...I&#x27;ll pay them a visit then!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Alright, until Kanami and them get here, I guess I&#x27;ll work a little.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> --KIEEEEEE!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> If you could please keep it coming, just like that. --SEII!<br>
<strong>Kuroko:</strong> Despite all her talk of skipping out, she does her job well, doesn&#x27;t she.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> ...And now, more showed up? If I just have to keep doing this, then...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> It isn&#x27;t normally like this though... I wonder why.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Kuroko-. If you think things&#x27;re looking rough, take Mikoto and get out of here right away-.<br>
<strong>Kuroko:</strong> I would do that regardless. Onee-sama&#x27;s safety is my top priority.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> HAAAAAAAH!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Oh, good timing! Mai-chan, let&#x27;s finish them off!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Sure. I&#x27;ll be with you! --SEEEI!<br>
<strong>Kuroko:</strong> Those two harmonize almost as well as Onee-sama and myself. As if they can read each other&#x27;s minds.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> You&#x27;re not wrong. At least, about the part where they&#x27;re in sync.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> They truly are gathering here... Shichinosato Kofuki must be overjoyed at the situation, but where is she?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Agh, why&#x27;d you guys come out here. Don&#x27;t go taking my aradama-chan from me.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> You don&#x27;t get a say in this. We&#x27;ll all wipe them out at once. That&#x27;s the most reliable way.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Sorry, but it&#x27;d help if you lent us your power, Misaka.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> Sure, you got it.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Well, it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s that different for me whether the aradama get stopped or they&#x27;re still moving-.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> With Yume-chan here, we&#x27;ve got the strength of a hundred people. Though, I&#x27;m not about to get outdone!<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> As you&#x27;d guess, after all the aradama we defeated today, we managed to collect a lot of tamahagane.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Though, why were those aradama appearing around Setouchi-san and the others, anyway?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Did anything different from usual happen?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Nah, nothing I can think of. Right?<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> I can&#x27;t think of anything either. I just gave my support like I always do.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Big news, I have big news!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Ellen-chan? What&#x27;s going on?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Here&#x27;s the story: we&#x27;ve found out something about this newly created tamahagane metal!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> It seems like, if you apply a fixed electromagnetic wave to it, it becomes easy to bond the metals together!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Though, we don&#x27;t know if this is the result of it being created from an applied electric current, or if it had these properties from the beginning.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> An electromagnetic wave?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Oi... Don&#x27;t tell me.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> If there&#x27;s aradama with that metal in them nearby, that won&#x27;t make them come running, will it?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Since we haven&#x27;t investigated these aradama themselves, I can&#x27;t say either way. But, I think there&#x27;s a possibility. Since it was incorporated into the aradama, it must have kind of effect.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> Then, the reason they kept gathering together today was because...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Cause Biribiri-onee-san was calling them all there?<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> C-Come to think of it... I was firing off electricity harder than usual, because there weren&#x27;t many people nearby.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> ...Is that what caused it!?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Hmm hmm, I do think this is a very interesting case.<br>
<strong>Mii:</strong> So long as we gathered lots as well, it all turned out alright, Misaka-san.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> That&#x27;s true, but... When I think of my own power causing trouble...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> This is just a layman&#x27;s opinion, but, if Misaka&#x27;s elecric shocks are gathering the aradama, could we not use that to bring them all to one place?<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> That&#x27;s it! I think that&#x27;s a great idea!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> That might make dealing with this easier. If all goes well, we can could finish this up in one shot.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> If we take out all the aradama gathered there at once, it&#x27;ll mean Misaka-san and the others can go home sooner.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> None of us object to that. Right?<br>
<strong>Kazari:</strong> I think it&#x27;s a good plan.<br>
<strong>Misaki:</strong> It seems like Misaka-san is the cause of lots of problems, so you&#x27;ll have to work hard enough to make up for it.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> You don&#x27;t have to chime in on every little thing... You&#x27;re not doing anything either.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> It&#x27;d be best to get this taken care of as soon as we can. Tomorrow, we&#x27;ll start preparing to carry out the operation.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Kitora, Yanase, Iwakura, and Setouchi, I want you working together on the strategy.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> The rest of you are dismissed. Rest up for tomorrow!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="5-steel-a-flash-of-light-and-a-twist-of-fate"></a>5: Steel, a Flash of Light, and a Twist of Fate<a class="hash-link" href="#5-steel-a-flash-of-light-and-a-twist-of-fate" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>The following day--</p><p><strong>Kanami:</strong> Misaka-san, are you nervous?<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> No, not particularly. Ah, not to make it sound like I haven&#x27;t been thinking this through...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I get it. I know how much you&#x27;ve been helping us suppress aradama this whole time.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> We&#x27;ll pull this off for sure; today&#x27;s operation.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> Of course!<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> Do you know where we&#x27;re doing it? I think it&#x27;d be good to be someplace like yesterday, out in the mountains where there aren&#x27;t many people around.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> We do too. The plan is to have Misaka-san fire off her electricity and call the aradama to a place with little people nearby.<br>
<strong>Mii:</strong> That would be the best strategy for avoiding casualties.<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> Wah!? Th-That surprised me...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Oh no... It looks like there&#x27;s multiple appearances of aradama! These readings, they&#x27;re increasing little by little?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> The site isn&#x27;t far. All toji here will leave straight away. Misaka, it&#x27;d help if you came with us, just to be safe.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> That&#x27;s what I planned on from the start. Let&#x27;s hurry! --Come on, Kuroko!<br>
<strong>Kuroko:</strong> Of course, Onee-sama!<br>
<strong>Kazari:</strong> ...Wait? Isn&#x27;t this place where the aradama are appearing... It&#x27;s right near where we first came to this world, isn&#x27;t it?<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> Eh, weren&#x27;t there a lot of people walking around there? ...Is this going to be okay?<br>
<strong>Misaki:</strong> Hmmm.<br>
<strong>Misaki:</strong> You knoww, since this might be the last time and alll, what do you think about going to take a look?<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> GUOOOOOOOO!!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> What&#x27;s going on here? Today&#x27;s aradama-chan are biting at the bit! There&#x27;s loads of &#x27;em too!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> This isn&#x27;t good... Evacuations haven&#x27;t been fully completed yet. As things are now, the civilians will come under attack... Shichinosato Kofuki, Setouchi Chie, hold off that large aradama!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Leave it all to me!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> You&#x27;re going to take care of the evacuations, right, Mirja-san? We&#x27;ll handle things here.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> It would be too optimistic to think aradama wouldn&#x27;t approach civilians in the process of evacuating, after all.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> Can I suggest something? What if Kuroko and I go around hitting the aradama one by one with my electricity, and Shidou-san and everyone follows along taking them out?<br>
<strong>Kuroko:</strong> It can give you some time to help lead the evacuations. Onee-sama and I should be able to do that much.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I hate to put you two in such a dangerous role, but could I ask you to do that?<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> I know, just leave it to me. Help me out here, Kuroko!<br>
<strong>Kuroko:</strong> I can&#x27;t say I don&#x27;t object to you diving into danger, but you&#x27;ve always been one to take action at times like these, Onee-sama.<br>
<strong>Kuroko:</strong> Then, if you&#x27;d give me your hand.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> We&#x27;ll take care of what we need to also.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> I know, there&#x27;s one thing we have to make sure of. We can&#x27;t let any of the civilians to get hurt...<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Let&#x27;s eliminate the aradama. Quickly!<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> Take some of this--!<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> Gu... Ggu...!<br>
<strong>Kuroko:</strong> Well done. Then, on to the next.<br>
<strong>Kuroko:</strong> My positioning could steal one&#x27;s heart, if I say so myself. Now, Onee-sama--<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> Gg... Ggg...!<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> Kuroko, next!<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> Misaka-san and Shirai-san are incredible out there, but Etou-san, Tsubakuro-san, and Shidou-san are pretty amazing too... ...They&#x27;re taking out aradama left and right!<br>
<strong>Kazari:</strong> Still, there&#x27;s some people who haven&#x27;t evacuated yet... Is there anything we can do to lend a hand?<br>
<strong>Mii:</strong> I think we should try not to get in their way, but I understand how you feel. Should we go ask to see if we can help a little?<br>
<strong>Kazari:</strong> Alright...!<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> There they go. I should go with. What about you, Shokuhou-san?<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> ...Wait, what&#x27;re you taking out your remote for?<br>
<strong>Misaki:</strong> Just a little somethingg.<br>
<strong>Misaki:</strong> I myself plan on getting to safetyy, but, more importantly, won&#x27;t those two leave you behind if you don&#x27;t hurry?<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> Ah! Wait up-. Uiharu-, Konori-senpai-.<br>
<strong>Misaki:</strong> And, beep. With that--<br>
<strong>Misaki:</strong> (By altering the memories of the people here juuust a little, so that they leave immediately, it should speed up the evacuations, shouldn&#x27;t it?)<br>
<strong>Misaki:</strong> Now it&#x27;s up to Misaka-san to go at it like a workhorse.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> It looks like they&#x27;ve finished up evacuating, but with more and more aradama coming, can you really keep up with this!?<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> I&#x27;ll be fine. Though... We need to do something about them.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Looking at the the spectrum finder, the aradama detected in the area... all seem to be gathering around Misaka-san.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> At this rate, it&#x27;ll turn out just like that operation we were setting up today.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> ...Still, we&#x27;ll just have to go along with it. I don&#x27;t think we can try taking the them somewhere else at this point. If they&#x27;re coming to me, we&#x27;ll use that and finish them all off at once.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> You&#x27;re saying you can take care of this many of them!? Seriously...? That&#x27;s crazy.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> I have a secret weapon. I&#x27;ll make sure to aim it off in the sky, so it should be safe.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> But this could be a little dangerous for all you toji, so stand back.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> I&#x27;m going to put an end to all the mess you&#x27;re causing. ...This is me at... FULL POWERRRR!!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> A-Amazing...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> But hey, doesn&#x27;t it look like they&#x27;re all turning into one big aradama!?<br>
<strong>Aradama Roar:</strong> GUOOOOOOOOONN!!<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> Ah...<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Ellen said the metal&#x27;d bond together, but I didn&#x27;t think that meant the aradama would too...<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> Is this going to be okay...?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> It shouldn&#x27;t be a problem for us. You did a great job. Thanks.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Yeah, yeah. To pay you back for that, I&#x27;ll let you see what makes me so great now~.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> You just sit back and watch, Biribiri-onee-san!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> I don&#x27;t get to see aradama-chan like this all that much. Damn... I&#x27;m getting goosebumps!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Heh, it&#x27;s only at moments like this I can depend on your enthusiasm, Shichinosato Kofuki.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Kofuki-chan gets so lively at times like these, doesn&#x27;t she?<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> If we just handle this like we usually do, it should be fine.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Mmhm. We just need to pool our strength--<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> We can do this, everyone! Let&#x27;s go!<br>
After supressing the aradama--</p><p><strong>Mai:</strong> We managed to gather lots of that metal, but, will Misaka-san and the others really be able to get home with this?<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> To be honest, I&#x27;m not sure. Though, it&#x27;s not like we&#x27;ll get anywhere if we don&#x27;t give it a shot.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Grandpa said we should aim to get as much of the newly created tamahagane metal that would be needed to make one okatana. We have just enough!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Besides, if we just kept on picking up metal, who knows when it&#x27;d end.<br>
<strong>Misaki:</strong> We don&#x27;t know just how much of this metal came over here with us in the first placee.<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> Now that you mention it, this could be the end of our parallel world lifestyle here, huhh.<br>
<strong>Kazari:</strong> At least be happy that we could get to go back home-.<br>
<strong>Kazari:</strong> Though, I would have liked to have eaten more of the B-grade gourmet Iwakura-san showed me about.<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> So you feel the same, Uiharu-!<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> I wanted to look more into rumors and things unique to this world too. Who gets chances at stuff like this.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ahaha, you onee-sans are funny!<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> It&#x27;s a shame we can&#x27;t say we&#x27;ll do that next time, but I&#x27;m glad to hear it got your interest.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> What do we need to do in order to replicate the experiment that will send you home?<br>
<strong>Mii:</strong> When we arrived, Misaka-san sent out a strong electric current, so doesn&#x27;t it seem possible doing the same thing might have the same effect?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> If it doesn&#x27;t work, we can figure something out then.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> And if it does, it might really mean goodbye. Ah, I shouldn&#x27;t say &quot;might&quot;, should I.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> Yeah. We caused you a lot of trouble, but tha--<br>
<strong>Kuroko:</strong> Ahh... Once Onee-sama and I return to our love nest, we can start with a gentle hug and passionate kiss.<br>
<strong>Kuroko:</strong> And then, Onee-sama and I will, ahhhn--!!<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> K-Kuroko! Don&#x27;t go causing a misunderstanding... saying things like that at a time like this!<br>
<strong>Kuroko:</strong> Calling it a misunderstanding is too too much... And after, ever since we came to this world, I&#x27;ve been refraining from our everyday skinship; you&#x27;re heartless, Onee-sama!<br>
<strong>Kuroko:</strong> I can&#x27;t... I can&#x27;t stand it any longer, Onee-samaaahhn!<br>
<strong>Mii:</strong> In its own way, things are already back to normal.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> I told you, get off of me!<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> Doesn&#x27;t this kind of feel like how it was like when we first came here?<br>
<strong>Misaki:</strong> That&#x27;s truee. This feels like it really could be goodbye.<br>
<strong>Kazari:</strong> All of you toji should get away, quick! Just to be safe!<br>
<strong>Mii:</strong> Thank you so much, for all the accomodations you gave us.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> Aghh, come on! I wish I could&#x27;ve given a proper goodbye at least... Thanks for everything. We won&#x27;t forget about you--<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Stay safe-! Or, they&#x27;re already gone, huh.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I wonder if they managed to make it home okay.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> There&#x27;s not much point in asking that, is there? We can&#x27;t make sure either way.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Tsubakuro-san isn&#x27;t wrong. But we can at least pray for their safe return.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Still, esper powers, huh-. There might be all kinds of worlds out there that we just don&#x27;t know about.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah! They really were unbelievable people.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="6-what-do-we-need-to-do-to-get-home"></a>6: What Do We Need to Do to Get Home?<a class="hash-link" href="#6-what-do-we-need-to-do-to-get-home" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Kanami:</strong> Shidou-san. I brought Mikasa-san and everyone-.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Thanks. I&#x27;ll get straight to the point then.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I&#x27;m sure you can all imagine why I&#x27;ve BROUGHT you here. The investigation into this metal found among the noro has made progress.<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> Then, you found something out?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Kohagura, can I leave the explanation to you?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Understood! Nice to meet you, I&#x27;m Kohagura Ellen. Let&#x27;s all get along, okay!<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> Wow-, check it out, Uiharu. She&#x27;s huge.<br>
<strong>Kazari:</strong> You know you shouldn&#x27;t do that... Even if you&#x27;re thinking it, don&#x27;t say it.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Ellen-chan is the granddaughter of Dr. Friedman, the man investigating this metal, and she got us in touch with their research institute.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> First, I&#x27;ll share what we&#x27;ve learned.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> According to Grandpa and the Special Rare Metals Utilization Research Institute, although this metal is being found in the noro, it did not exist in our world beforehand.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Although it&#x27;s similar in composition to Tamahagane, it is a different metal. Even with the same volume, it&#x27;s slightly lighter, for example.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> If it&#x27;s a different metal, then that means it did come with us from our world...?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> I think there&#x27;s a good chance of that.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Of course, it&#x27;s also possible that it was created at the point you all arrived here, for some still unknown reason.<br>
<strong>Mii:</strong> It seems clear that the tamahagane created from the experiment Misaka-san helped with is something brand new.<br>
<strong>Kuroko:</strong> Though, that much won&#x27;t help us find a means of going back to our own world.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Oi, Ellen. How about you tell them the theory you were talking about before?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> I guess I should. This isn&#x27;t confirmed yet, but we have a hypothesis about our world, your world, and what caused them to be linked together.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> According to Grandpa, this metal, which closely resembles tamahagane, may have been a catalyst for going through the netherworld to here.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> So, if we came here through the netherworld, how would we go about getting back home?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> If we assume that the tamahagane you tried to create also exists in your original world, if we try to form the same tamahagane here, then--<br>
<strong>Kazari:</strong> You mean, the same thing that happened when we came here might happen again?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> We&#x27;re only talking hypothetically, but that&#x27;s exactly right! And, for that reason, we&#x27;ll need to gather as much of that generated metal as we possibly can.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> So then, when we&#x27;re on missions, there might be aradama with that metal inside them, so we need to watch out.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Yep! From the aradama we&#x27;ve defeated in the past few days, there seems to be lots of cases of finding noro containing that metal, though only in small amounts.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> We&#x27;ll get up a whole bunch of it so you can go home, so just wait a little while longer.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> Thank you.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> But, let us do what we can too. We might not be able to defeat aradama, but I think we can help. It seems like we&#x27;re the cause of this, after all.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> With your electric shocks, and depending on how we use Shirai-san&#x27;s teleportation, it might be effective in fighting aradama?<br>
<strong>Kuroko:</strong> If that&#x27;s what Onee-sama plans on doing, I, Kuroko, will offer you toji my assistance.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> Shidou-san. Will you allow us to help you eliminate the aradama?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I&#x27;d honestly like to refuse you here, but, alright. Only on the condition that you never put yourselves at risk. Fighting the aradama is our duty.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> Understood, thank you very much! Alright-, let&#x27;s go!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Let&#x27;s give it our all, Misaka-san!<br>
<strong>Misaki:</strong> Do your best, everyone~.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations/edit/docs/A_Certain_Superpowered_Parallel_World.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_2_ui" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_3DPF"></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"></div></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_35-E thin-scrollbar"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#1-our-first-aradama-experience" class="table-of-contents__link">1: Our First Aradama Experience</a></li><li><a href="#2-tamahagane" class="table-of-contents__link">2: Tamahagane?</a></li><li><a href="#3-toji-are-highly-busy" class="table-of-contents__link">3: Toji are Highly Busy</a></li><li><a href="#4-whats-the-reason-for-why-they-gather" class="table-of-contents__link">4: What&#39;s the Reason for Why They Gather?</a></li><li><a href="#5-steel-a-flash-of-light-and-a-twist-of-fate" class="table-of-contents__link">5: Steel, a Flash of Light, and a Twist of Fate</a></li><li><a href="#6-what-do-we-need-to-do-to-get-home" class="table-of-contents__link">6: What Do We Need to Do to Get Home?</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Links</div><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://pastebin.com/LdyviZ8Z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Translator anon&#x27;s pastebin<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Site source code<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Built with Docusaurus.</div></div></div></footer></div>
