Something terrible has happened!!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Get a hold of yourself! As ninja in the service of Yukari-sama, we Origami ninja must always be calm and collected.<br><strong>Sakura:</strong> I-I'm... Very sorry...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Now then, what happened?<br><strong>Sakura:</strong> That's, ninja from another territory seem to have infiltrated our ninja mansion. Their target is likely...<br><strong>Sakura:</strong> That "secret letter", I believe.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> What are the guards doing, allowing the enemy to slip through? If they're that negligent, I'll have to re-discipline them later.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> However, Makizou-dono, we do have a bit of spare time. A round of rat hunting might be amusing.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> A rat hunt...? You may be on to something, Suzusuke-dono.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> If they're skilled enough to invade here, they may prove useful in killing time... We'll see.<br>Meanwhile, on the other side--</p><p><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Damnit, why do I have to play along with this dumb stuff? What moron came up with "Mokusa ninja"!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> P-Please calm down, Kofukimaru-san. If you make too much noise, the enemy will find us.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> And who do you think you're calling Kofukimaru?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Please calm down, that's just how it is. We've come this far, so please give up and accept it.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> I'm no good at giving up!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Anyway, you're acting pretty weird. Can't believe you actually volunteered for this stupid job.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ehh~, it seemed like a lot of fun.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> No good... You and I are on totally different channels. I'm not into this kind of game.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> And since I'm not into it, can I drop the act and just call it quits here?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You can't do that. We're not allowed to go back until the mission is over, Shichinosato-san. Ahh, I didn't mean that! ...Kofukimaru-san!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Ugh, well whatever... Let's get this bad joke over with already. So, what's this thing we're after again?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Within this mansion, there lies a certain secret message. We need to steal it and escape the village.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Right, great... So what the hell is "a certain secret message"? What "village"?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> The secret message is a secret message. The village is a village. Please don't try to poke holes in the setting.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Poke holes!? Between the secret message and the village, there's more holes than setting!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> I guess it doesn't matter... I just have to play along. Let's hurry and get this over with!<br>Once again, on the other side--</p><p><strong>Maki:</strong> There you are! Skulking around in a place like this; you truly are rats!<br><strong>Nagasaki Sumi:</strong> Ahh, we're not rats, we're ninja...<br><strong>Maruyama Akane:</strong> That's right! We're ninja, so of course we're gonna hide!<br><strong>Akane:</strong> A ninja without the nin is just a ja! [ninja is made up the kanji nin, to hide, and ja, person]<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Still, to be discovered so quickly... We can't take the Origami ninja lightly.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> In the first place, you're all disorganized.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> What a shame... At this rate, our fun will be over all too soon.<br><strong>Akane:</strong> Hey-! We Mokusa ninja've been training our bodies hard! You'll regret looking down on us!<br><strong>Sumi:</strong> Ah... We were trying to stay undercover... Why did you say who we are...?<br><strong>Akane:</strong> Ah- No wayyy! You tricked me! That's playing dirty!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I don't believe it; you actually revealed your own identity... Even disorganized was giving you too much credit. Please try not to disappoint us any further.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> We have no obligation to meet your expectations, but we can't continue like we planned. Everyone, get ready!<br><strong>Sumi:</strong> Right!<br><strong>Akane:</strong> I'll follow your lead!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...Well, self-proclaimed Mokusa ninja, could you please entertain us for a while?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> You came all this way to face defeat!  </p><h2 id="2-the-difference-in-daily-training-shown-through-defeat" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>2: The Difference in Daily Training Shown Through Defeat</h2><p><strong>Akane:</strong> Ninja Art: Deadlift Technique!!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> I can see right through it!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> HNPH-!!<br><strong>Akane:</strong> Gahhh! So... Heavy... How can one strike be that heavy!?  
<strong>Maki:</strong> Oh...? You were able to block that? Though if you don't put your hips into it, you'll be split in two.<br><strong>Akane:</strong> Easy for you to say, but I'm overworked here...!<br><strong>Akane:</strong> For me to get overpowered like this... No way... You're so tough... What routine did you do to get like this?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> I'll tell you... First, a light run of about 40km. Follow that with fingertip push ups, sit ups, lat pulldowns, squat hops, lateral crossovers, and pull ups. That's 500 repetitions of each.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Then 200 curls with a 40kg weight in each hand. Next, with an axe, I chop 1,000 pieces of firewood, followed by 2,000 practice swings with my sword.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Now a run up a flight of 200 stone steps, 20 times. Then a 20km swim against the waves. Finally, two sparring sessions to finish it off.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Take a good cleansing bath to relax your muscles, and eat a lot of nutritious food. That's all.<br><strong>Akane:</strong> That's all...! Your routine's insane...!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> If she's off duty that day, she'll do it all twice...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Or at least, that's the character she's playing.<br><strong>Akane:</strong> Character!? I thought you were serious, you got me~!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Don't break character, Suzuka. You ruined such a perfect mood!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> It could cause trouble if she actually believed you. Not to mention, I didn't think you'd get so carried away...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Anyway, with the rigorous training I go through every day, my strength has no equal!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> And here's proof! Origami Ninja Art: Great Tornado Whirlwind Cutter!!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> This... Sword pressure... Kyaaaaa!!<br><strong>Akane:</strong> Gyaaaah~ I'm beaaaaat~... Thud...!!<br><strong>Sumi:</strong> Th-Thud...!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> In the end, you were no match for us Origami ninja. You need to show more dedication to your training.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Sakurayoshi, please escort the captured Yanase Mai, Maruyama Akane, and Nagasaki Sumi to the dungeon.<br><strong>Sakura:</strong> U-Understood!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> ...Still, it doesn't add up.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> What doesn't?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Did Mokusa's leader really believe ninja of that caliber could steal the secret letter from our mansion?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Perhaps... They lack the manpower for it?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Perhaps. But it's too soon to grow complacent.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Us undermining their plan could have been another part of their plan. Thinking along those lines--<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I see... These girls were a diversion. Their main force is sneaking in elsewhere.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> It's a reasonable assumption.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Then, let us hunt down this main force. Maybe they can prove more entertaining.  </p><h2 id="3-thats-a-promise" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>3: That's a Promise</h2><p><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I see why they call this the impregnable ninja mansion of the Origami ninja. We'll have to move cautiously through here.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Of course there's hidden pitfalls... But then there's this kind of trap and that kind of trap. Not to mention, I didn't even think they could prepare a trap like that one! Very impressive.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> This kind of trap and that kind of trap? What kind of trap?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Y-You know... An amazing trap that would make you shout "AHH!" if you sprung it...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> I hate to rain on your parade, but there's no traps anywhere in here, you know?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Well~, what about a falling ceiling or a flooding room... It's more fun to pretend those kind of traps are there!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...You're surprisingly into this stuff, huh, Kiyoka. Well, at least someone's having fun with it.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Are you not having fun, Kofukimaru-san?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Do I look like I'm having fun? I keep telling you, let's just get this over with so we can go home already.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> For that, we need to locate their secret letter...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Yeah, I know. The problem is where are they keeping this secret whatever?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> According to the setting, the secret letter is extremely important, so they must be keeping it in the most secure part of the mansion.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Looking at the structure of the building... Ah, I mean, considering the circumstances, I believe it's in the innermost room of the mansion.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Considering the circumstances, the innermost room, huh. You sure about that?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> In cases like this, that's a promise.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Promise, huh... So you've really got no idea.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Let's head deeper in at least. The secret letter is sure to be there, I know it... Considering the circumstances.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Considering the circumstances, huh... But before that, we've got guests.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Guests?<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> KIKIKIGIGIGIGIGIGI...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Aradama!? No way, why!?  
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Who cares why? They showed up at the best possible time!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> I was about to die from boredom! I love you! My aradama-chan!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Mmmm~ I feel great! Aradama-chan's the best after all!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Using aradama is going too far! I never heard anything about this.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Do the defenders want to win that badly? In that case, this should count as a foul... Actually, it should be an out.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Since it's come to this, we can't afford to lose either. We have to defeat the evil deputies, and bring peace back to the land!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> No, there's no evil deputies! And the game's rules didn't say anything about peace; we've just gotta bring back the secret letter.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> .........! Ah, that's right!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Don't give me that. Just how carried away with this game are you gonna get? And anyway, about those aradama.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> They didn't come from the other team. They must have just showed up on their own.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> They did!?  
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> No matter how bad they want to win, nobody's gonna use aradama for this dumbass make believe exercise!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> .........They wouldn't, right?  </p><h2 id="4-after-a-furious-finish-farewell-ninja-mansion" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>4: After a Furious Finish, Farewell, Ninja Mansion</h2><p><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...Kofukimaru-san. It seems we've reached the mansion's innermost room. That secret letter is sure to be here...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> It was surprisingly easy finding this place.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Fufufufufu... Of course it was.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> After all, we wanted to guide you here.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> The Origami ninja, they found us!?  
<strong>Maki:</strong> Suspecting nothing, you happily wandered right into our ambush.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> There's nowhere left to run or hide. At last you realize, you're nothing but trapped rats.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Trapped rats, or wolves in sheep's clothing? Doesn't matter. Either way, we're gonna lay you flat here.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Oh? At least your tongue is sharp, if nothing else.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> You'll find out how sharp the rest is, once we beat you.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> You're not too bad at this.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> More importantly... Where's the secret letter?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> If that's what you're after, Sakurayoshi is guarding it there.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That's...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> I'll handle our foes. Sakurayoshi, in the meantime, keep the secret letter safe!<br><strong>Sakura:</strong> U-U-U-U-Understood! Ahh- Kyaah!!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> What are you doing, Sakurayoshi! Hurry and escape with the secret letter!<br><strong>Sakura:</strong> Ah, owwwww... I fell over, I think I cracked my butt...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> It was cracked from the beginning! Hurry! Escape! Protect the secret letter!<br><strong>Sakura:</strong> I'm sorry... B-But it hurts... Ughh, I can't stand up...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Absolutely pathetic... You call yourself an Origami ninja!?  
<strong>Sakura:</strong> Ah... I'm sorry...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Makizou-dono, don't be so hard on her. Not everyone who gathered here is a toji like us. She's only a researcher from the medical department.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> ...Have you forgotten, Suzusuke? Right now, we're all ninja! Nothing more, nothing less.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> "Toji", "researchers", words like those which break this world have no place here!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I understand that, but... I didn't think you'd be so obsessive about it. In a way, I'm impressed!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You let your guard down! I'll be taking the secret letter now!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Damn! Run, Sakurayoshi!!<br><strong>Sakura:</strong> Ahhh~~!! My butt! My butt still hurts...!<br><strong>Announcer:</strong> Time is up. Time is up. The invading team could not complete their objective within the time limit. Therefore, the defending team wins.<br><strong>Announcer:</strong> I repeat: Time is up. Time is up. The invading team could not complete their objective within the time limit. Therefore, the defending team wins.<br><strong>Announcer:</strong> Good work out there, everyone. With this, the special training course "Ninja Mansion" is concluded.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Phew~ We were in a pinch, but it's our victory.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> That was a close one, to be sure.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ahhh~, we lost...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> I couldn't care less about this training, but losing's still frustrating.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You say that, but I think you were enjoying it by the end, Shichinosato-san.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Tch, I wasn't really enjoying it.<br><strong>Sakura:</strong> W-Well I enjoyed it! Usually I'm too busy with research to get out much, so... I had fun!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Don't be mistaken, this wasn't a game. It's still practice. A part of our training.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> There's nothing wrong with enjoying your training though, isn't that right, "Makizou-dono"?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Aghh~ If only we'd had a few more seconds!<br><strong>Sumi:</strong> I'm jealous you all got to participate till the end...<br><strong>Akane:</strong> I know, they just scooped us up and locked us away! I thought we'd get to do more!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Let's learn from our mistakes next time.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> We aren't about to lose next time either.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Next time...? You can't be serious. If you're gonna do it, have fun without me.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> What are you saying, Shichinosato Kofuki? You don't mean you're quitting here, do you?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Huhh? You're the one talking crazy. Of course I'm not sticking around!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Oh my. It seems that no one explained in detail to you.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> About what?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> The foundation of this project is role-playing. Along with the victory condition, it's important that you're able to adapt to your role.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> This program serves as training for your ability to carry out whatever role you're given.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> It goes without saying that a team of toji working together need to trust each other to cooperate. Acting according to your private interests is forbidden.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> And in your case, Shichinosato-san. With your complete lack of cooperation, we were asked by Kitora Mirja-san to train you thoroughly.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Don't think you'll get to leave until after we finish all seven more sets.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Huuuhhhh~~~~~~!? Seven sets!?  
<strong>Announcer:</strong> In a moment, the next training course will begin. The name of the program is "The Queen and the Great Thieves".
