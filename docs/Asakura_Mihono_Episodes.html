Eh!? Crap! I'm gonna be late!<br><strong>Subara Rika:</strong> Morning, Mihono-chan~. You overslept again, didn't you? Your hair's a mess. You're usually so early on days with sparring practice though.<br><strong>Rika:</strong> Even if regular classes are boring, this is why you keep getting scolded, you know? But personally, I think learning the history of toji and tamahagane, and the relationship between noro and aradama, is pretty interesting.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah, buttt...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah! More importantly! How're things going with that Fujiwara Shinjo-kun? If you don't hurry up, some other girl might make a move!<br><strong>Rika:</strong> H-Hey, keep it quiet, Mihono-chan! ...Umm, y-yesterday, I... Sent him a message.<br><strong>Rika:</strong> And, so, we're going to start studying together in the library soon.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Good for you! ...Wait, you two are childhood friends, aren't you? How are you only just now studying together?<br><strong>Rika:</strong> Look, Mihono-chan. As the heir to a shrine, Fujiwara-kun is working extremely hard!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I get that, but... Mmm, it feels like you two should have sealed the deal by now...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Hm?<br><strong>???:</strong> A-! SA-! KU-! RA-! MI-! HO-! NOOOO--! LET'S DUEL--!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Whoa! (Dodge!)<br><strong>???:</strong> UWAAAHH!<br><em>thud</em></p><p><strong>Nagae Futaba:</strong> Don't dodge! Fight me fair and square!<br><strong>Rika:</strong> Fudaba-chan... There's nothing fair and square about sneak attacks...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Geez, you're always all worked up. You'd be so much cuter if you'd just calm down... You're not getting any more popular like that, you know?<br><strong>Futaba:</strong> Huh...!?<br><strong>Rika:</strong> Ufufu. You really like Mihono-chan, don't you, Futaba-chan?<br><strong>Futaba:</strong> I do not!<br><strong>Hattori Tetsuo:</strong> Ah! I figured you were the ones making all that noise! If you aren't busy, they need you to help out!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah, Hattori-senpai? Good morning-!<br><strong>Futaba:</strong> ...Gu-Goodmor... Ning...<br><strong>Hattori:</strong> What, you two were fighting again? Try to take it easy. Wouldn't want to see either of you get hurt.<br><strong>Hattori:</strong> Anyway, Asakura! You're getting called to action. Sounds like aradama showed up.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Huh? Uh, you're right! Sorry, Rika! I gotta go!<br><strong>Futaba:</strong> Ah! I'll go too!<br><strong>Hattori:</strong> You're staying put. For starters, they didn't call on you, and besides, you haven't been cleared for real combat yet.<br><strong>Rika:</strong> How'd it go, Mihono-chan?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Somehow I made it through without a scratch.<br><strong>Hattori:</strong> Good work. Give your Kiyomitsu to me; I'll do some maintenance on it.<br><strong>Futaba:</strong> Ah, Senpai! Um, ah... Err, m-my...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Don't worry about it, Senpai. I didn't wear Kiyomitsu out too bad this time. And besides, its scheduled maintenance is pretty soon.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> But you should check out Futaba's Magoroku. She's been saying it's falling apart lately.<br><strong>Futaba:</strong> Ehh!?<br><strong>Hattori:</strong> Really? Then come on, Nagae. I'll give it a look.<br><strong>Futaba:</strong> A-Ah... Thank you so much, Hattori... Senpai...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...... .........<br><strong>Rika:</strong> What are you smiling about, Mihono-chan?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Nah, it's just... Kids these days, huh~?<br><strong>Rika:</strong> ?  </p><h2 id="2-her-mothers-okatana" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>2: Her Mother's Okatana</h2><p><strong>Mirja:</strong> I'm sorry to take up your time like this. There's something I wanted to ask you today... About Asakura Mihono's okatana, Kashuu Kiyomitsu.<br><strong>Asakura Yoshizumi:</strong> I don't mind one bit, Kitora... Mirja-san, was it? Time's about all I've got left to give anymore. So, what's got you so curious?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I have an ability... "Kantougan". When my okatana comes in contact with another, it lets me understand to a degree all there is to know about its background.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Of course, it's not uncommon for two blades to come into contact with each other in a match, so...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Anyway... In training the other day I was able to confirm it. Asakura Mihono's okatana is the very same Kashuu Kiyomitsu that was wielded by Okita Souji.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Of course, there's the well known legend of that okatana... Of how, during the Ikedaya incident, the tip of it was broken off.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> However...<br><strong>Yoshizumi:</strong> You don't think quite that much had been broken, is that it? After all, in that raid by the Shinsengumi, it was only the very tip that broke.  Hmm... You sure do know the history of that okatana well.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> As a general rule, okatana do not break. However, this would mark the second time Kiyomitsu has broken... What is the meaning of this?<br><strong>Yoshizumi:</strong> To give you an idea, I'll have to tell you a story of that girl's mother.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ......<br><strong>Yoshizumi:</strong> Don't worry, it's not such a sad story. Her mother was a toji as well. That okatana, Kashuu Kiyomitsu, belonged to her.<br><strong>Yoshizumi:</strong> It happened... About 20 years ago, on the day of the disaster. The unit her mother was in was cut off and surrounded by countless aradama.<br><strong>Yoshizumi:</strong> I'm told it was a very fierce battle. At some point, the end of that unbreakable okatana, much like back in the days of the Tokugawa shogunate, came flying off.<br><strong>Yoshizumi:</strong> The fragment that broke this time buried itself deep in Mihono's mother's chest, and could not be removed again.<br><strong>Yoshizumi:</strong> She returned safely from the battle, but... No more than ten years after, she passed on from this world.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I'm sorry to hear that...<br><strong>Yoshizumi:</strong> Actually, the story doesn't end there. During that time, she had become pregnant with Mihono...<br><strong>Yoshizumi:</strong> And it was no longer there. Under medical treatment, they searched again and again to try removing the fragment. But they couldn't find it anywhere in her body.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> What does that mean...?<br><strong>Yoshizumi:</strong> You might have guessed... Mihono being chosen by Kashuu Kiyomitsu seems like no coincidence, after all.<br><strong>Yoshizumi:</strong> Even now, that fragment may be resting inside of her... At least, I can't help but believe as much.  </p><h2 id="3-about-the-childhood-friends-1" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>3: About the Childhood Friends (1)</h2><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> You wanted to hear about what we were like as childhood friends?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Yes. I was wondering about you and Setouchi-san. Ah, and here's your "Izu's 100 Famous Views Assorted Lunch" and green tea, Asakura-san.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Thanks. But, there's not much to say about me and Chii-nee.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Really? But among the five of us assigned here, you two just happened to be childhood friends. It feels almost like fate, doesn't it? Ah, here's your sandwich and warm tea, Setouchi-san.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Thank you. But to call it fate... It's more like, maybe... A punishment game? Isn't it, Mihono-chan?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> You heard, right Kiyoka? How I chased after Kanami and Chii-nee followed me. Well, President Ema got really mad and told us to work here.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Oh yeah, that's right... But, but, I'm still curious to hear what you were like as kids together.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Hmm~...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Well, it was about five years ago that Chii-nee moved away from Okayama... I was just a third year in elementary school back then, and Chii-nee had just started middle school.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> So you remember. Mihono-chan still acts mostly the same, but I used to be much more of a crybaby.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> My house wasn't too far from the Asakura Shrine, and so we'd always play around at the shrine until it got dark. It was a lot of fun; we'd all go catching bugs and playing other games.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> In the fall we'd eat baked sweet potatoes, and in the summer, the priest... Yoshizumi-san, would make us shaved ice. It was so good that I can still remember the taste.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> It's actually gotten a power up since! Grandpa makes his own jam and syrup for it now. He gets the fruit and ice locally too.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah, I'd like to try that sometime.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Me too; it's been so long.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Come on by, I'll set up reservations for two!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Ufufu~<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ahaha!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> But Chii-nee, you haven't changed a bit! You've still got that onee-san feeling... Your boobs got bigger though.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Really? Well you've changed and you haven't, Mihono-chan. You still have that strong sense of justice, and you charge right into danger the same way. But you're taller now, and so much stronger, and you became so pretty.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ahh! Geez! What's the big idea, complimenting me like that!? ...I'll be right back!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Um, where are you going?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> T-The bathroom...!<br><em>Mihono runs away blushing</em></p><p><strong>Chie:</strong> She didn't have to get so embarrassed about it.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> ......<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Welcome back, Shichinosato-san. How was the dining car?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Nothing special. Anyway, Mihono just ran by making a crazy face... What's up with that?  </p><h2 id="4-about-the-childhood-friends-2" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>4: About the Childhood Friends (2)</h2><p><strong>Chie:</strong> Well, since Mihono-chan went to the bathroom, I'll say this... Actually, that sense of justice of hers has always made her a little reckless.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Like when Etou Kanami-san and Juujou Hiyori-san attacked the head of the family... She ran after them shouting "I know there's a good reason for this!" Honestly, as her onee-san, I wish she wouldn't act like that...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...Like a moron?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Well, I think it's nice how much she trusts her friend.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Huh? It's still dumb. There's no way she was getting through the elite guard and the rest of them.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Mihono-chan's actually pretty capable, you know? In the qualifiers for the tournament, she came in third.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Huh? Wait, she was Minoseki's substitute?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Asakura-san is strong, isn't she?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> That's right. But, ever since we were young, she's always had problems with... Concentrating, I guess? Her bursts of strength always wore out quick.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> What do you mean?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Our master used to say... Ah, when Mihono-chan was in elementary school, we went to the same fencing dojo together. Well, all the kids in the area went to some dojo.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Anyway, when Mihono-chan was young... She used to shock even our master with her skill.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Especially when she'd use techniques she shouldn't have learned yet, and she'd show a surprising level of judgment in what to use... But...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> But?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Strangely, it never lasted very long. Before you knew it she'd be back to her usual self.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Isn't that sort of like a toji's abilities?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> It was the same even when she didn't have an okatana, so I don't think so. As a swordfighter, when she didn't have that power, she was... Intense, yet average, I guess?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> So that's why she didn't qualify as Minoseki's representative.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> But still, her sense of justice has always been strong... When she was little, she beat up some boys who were neighborhood bullies. And she sort of became their boss? Like joining Mihono's party?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> And one time we ran into an aradama in the woods. Mihono-chan held it off while we ran to call the adults.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> (Now that I think about it... Mihono-chan was always running into aradama, wasn't she? Almost like they'd gather around where she went...)<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It's weird to think of Asakura-san leading a group of boys around. I can't even imagine her doing that now.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> I know, she must have changed after entering middle school.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Hey.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Didn't she just enter her second year? So I'm supposed to believe... Just over a year ago, she was some kind of brat gang leader?<br><strong>Kiyoka/Chie:</strong> Now that you mention it!?  </p><h2 id="5-who-do-they-like" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>5: Who Do They Like?</h2><p><strong>Nagae Futaba:</strong> U-Um, Hattori-senpai! W-Would you take...! A-A-Another look at my okatana sometime!?<br><strong>Futaba:</strong> T-Thank you so much...! It's a promise!<br><strong>Hattori Tetsuo:</strong> O-Okay, sure... W-Wait! Uh, Futaba-chan, wasn't it?<br><strong>Hattori:</strong> She's gone already though... Oww! Watch it, Asakura!?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Uwah! It's him!<br><strong>Hattori:</strong> Come on, don't treat me like that. I'm not an aradama.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Well, I'm going then.<br><strong>Hattori:</strong> Hang on. There's something I seriously want your advice on. You seem like the real gossipy type.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...What's that? You wanna inspect my okatana up close and personal?<br><strong>Hattori:</strong> I'm just kidding!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Buy me sweets in the cafeteria for a week. Enough for me, Kiyoka, and Fukki. Then I'll help you out.<br><strong>Hattori:</strong> ...Fine, if that's what it takes.<br><strong>Hattori:</strong> Anyway, lately I've been seeing this gentle, and beautiful, and nice smelling, and accepting, and big chested... Goddess around...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...You're already creeping me out. And why'd you stop and sigh while looking at my chest? You want to see my okatana that badly?<br><strong>Hattori:</strong> Sorry, I didn't mean to! But anyway, I need your help picking out a present for her. Something that might make her want to go out with me.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> When you spring this on me all of a sudden, it's a little... Anyway, who's this "goddess"?<br><strong>Hattori:</strong> She comes here from Osafune every now and then.<br><strong>Hattori:</strong> Whenever I'm working support on the computers, she always smiles and tells me I'm doing such a good job. I'm surprised such an angel would be hanging out with you! No, she's a goddess!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (From Osafune...? Someone I know?)<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (Wait, that's gotta be Chii-nee!)<br><strong>Hattori:</strong> What's wrong? Should I keep going? I just need to know, you know... What kind of guy she likes.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> You mean Chii-nee, right? Just so you know, Chii-nee...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Who'd have guessed! She's into younger girls!<br><strong>Hattori:</strong> Wh... What...? So I never had a chance then...? Ahhhhh! Chie-saaaaan!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Oh, he ran off... It was just meant to be a joke... But if he was going to get shut down that easy, he didn't stand a chance anyway.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Still, to think Hattori-senpai would be into Chii-nee... That's too weird...<br><strong>Futaba:</strong> Hey, Mihono! You were talking to my Hattori-senpai, weren't you! Are you friends? Or... Don't tell me, you're going out!?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Huh? Going out with who?<br><strong>Futaba:</strong> Don't! Play! Dumb! With! Me!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Oh, you mean Hattori-senpai? Seems like he's into gentle, nice smelling, accepting, and big chested girls?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Good luck, Futaba!<br><strong>Futaba:</strong> Huh!? What do you mean, good luck!? T-Though I'm still growing... Mm, I'm still growing... I'll... I'll figure something out...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> You'll be fine! Hattori-senpai likes girls that praise him too, so just keep it up and he'll be all over you... Probably.<br><strong>Futaba:</strong> Really...? You sure know a lot, Mihono... Wait, how do you know so much about Hattori-senpai... Wait...!?<br><strong>Futaba:</strong> Tell me! Is he your ex!?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Why'd you think that!?<br><div><iframe width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/datvCWUrKKc"></iframe></div>  </p><h2 id="ceremonial-dress---misogi-start-first-mission-as-a-toji" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Ceremonial Dress - Misogi: Start]: First Mission as a Toji</h2><p>--This was at the time of Asakura Mihono's first assignment to suppress aradama.</p><p><strong>Aradama:</strong> GGYAAAAAAAA-!<br><strong>Fukuda Sawano:</strong> Ahem.

You're the spitting image of her, you know. Your mother.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Eh? Mom?<br><strong>Yoshizumi:</strong> Yes, your mother used to talk like that.

Are you going on a trip somewhere?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I'm planning on doing an overnight trip on New Year's Eve with Chii-nee... And, I was checking what sights we should go see!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Two girls, taking a trip into the new year together... Just those words alone are enough to make your heart throb. Maybe I'll tag along too...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Yamashiro Yui, that would be inconsiderate of you.

How about, photos of the two of you feeding each other food you bought on the train, like, "Ahhn"!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> And then, photos of you staring deep into each others' eyes on the beach while you share your love, and photos of the two of you proposing in a romantic church deep in the mountains!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I can't help but feel your suggestions are leading towards something other than a normal tour for two girls...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Well, I was hoping to have something a little more exciting for us to do together, but do you have any ideas, Mirja-san?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> If you are planning a New Year's trip, a shrine visit and viewing the first sunrise would be standard suggestions.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> And, if time permits, it might be good to work in something slightly more original.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Something more original? Like what?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> For example, rather than simply viewing the first sunrise on New Year's day, why not admire the setting sun on New Year's Eve?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> It's something I've considered for some time now. Everyone glorifies the year's first sunrise, but why do they pay no attention to the year's last sunset?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> You're right, every year things are so busy on the evening of New Year's Eve that I don't think I've ever sat back and watched the sun go down.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Yeah yeah, me too-.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> But you know, if I were the sun, I'd be happy having everyone admire me on New Year's morning, but I think I'd want people admiring me on the last sunset after I worked so hard all year too!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I've never exactly thought about how it would make the sun feel...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I've always thought that those who can appreciate the sunset, the same as they would the sunrise, will get the most benefit from the year's first sunrise the next morning.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I get it! I think that's a great way of looking at it. It might give us better fortune from watching the sunrise, so I I'll try putting watching the sunset into our plan too!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Okaaay, now just to find the perfect place to watch the sunset with Chii-nee!  </p><h2 id="casual-20---mihono-end-at-the-years-final-sunset" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Casual 20 - Mihono: End]: At the Year's Final Sunset...</h2><p>On New Year's Eve.

The setting sun looks so pretty!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> It sure is pretty, isn't it. Ah, Mihono-chan, it looks like we can go out onto the deck from there.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Whoa, the wind's strong out here. Chii-nee, be careful so your scarf doesn't get blown away, okay!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Right. You too, Mihono-chan; be sure your hat doesn't get swept off. Though, the air is nice and clear up here too.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah, it might be cold, but getting to see the sunset so clearly is the best! Oh yeah! Chii-nee, let's take a picture!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Another picture? You've been taking them nonstop ever since this morning.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> We're on a big trip together, so don't you want to have a bunch of things to remember it by? Kiyoka, could you take our picture with my phone?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I don't mind, but, Hono-chan, with all the pictures you're taking, your phone must be running out of space, right? I'll take it on my phone and send it to you later.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> You will? Thanks. That's a big help-.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Okay, Hono-chan, Setouchi-san, please come up with a pose!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Umm, a pose... What should we...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> If you want to give off a fun mood, how about if you do something like throwing both hands up in the air?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Like this? Banzai-!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Yeah, that's great, Hono-chan! Though, you still had your phone in your hand... Next, how about you stay just like that, but hold each other's hands?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> That might look good! Come on, hold my hand, Chii-nee! Yayyy!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> WAH---- What do I do!? I dropped my phone!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Eh-!? You mean right now, when we held hands?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I think so. It's not on the floor here, so don't tell me...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> You were swinging your hands all around, Onee-san, so I think it might've fallen all the way off the deck.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> No way...<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> This observation tower is a hundred meters up off the ground too. There's a cliff below us, so I don't think it could have hit anybody, but if it hit the rocks down there, it would have broken for sure...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I don't believe it... And I took so many pictures all day too-. Uuu... How could something like this happen...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Hono-chan, sorry. This all happened because I got carried away and asked you to do poses.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> It's not your fault, Kiyoka. I was the one who let go because I wasn't careful.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Sigh... For me to mess up this bad at the very very end of the year; my luck is the worst.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Don't look so sad, Mihono-chan. We might not be able to get the pictures back, but because of you, I've been having lots of fun all day.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> All the memories are right here in my heart, so it's fine. Here, raise up your head. We can still make plenty more memories together from now on.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Chii-nee...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ahh, the closeness between those two. It kind of makes you feel like tearing up, doesn't it?<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> I know. That closeness itself might be the best takeaway from this trip...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Hey, hey, somebody's phone's been ringing. It's ruining the mood. Whose is it?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> It isn't mine. ...Hm? Mihono-chan, isn't the ringing coming from behind you?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Huh? Now that you say it, I think so. But, my phone fell down the cliff...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Wait! Hono-chan, isn't there something in the hood of your parka?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Whoa-! It's my phone! It didn't fall down the cliff; it fell into my hood.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> I can hardly believe it. But, isn't that great for you, Asakura-san.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah, and it seems like all my photos are safe too. Sorry for making all of you worry, guys!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Good for you. But, wouldn't you normally notice if something fell into your hood, Onee-san?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I had no idea when it happened...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> You might not have been able to notice in the panic after you dropped it. But, I'm glad to see you're back to your happy self, Mihono-chan.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> By the way, your phone has been ringing for a while, hasn't it? Who's trying to get a hold of you?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ahhh! Yui sent me all these texts!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> "Where's those lovey dovey shots of you two you promised?" "The sun is already setting" "Hurry up-!" it says. Do you have to text her back?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> That reminds me, I did promise I'd send her pictures of Chii-nee and me together.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> But, all I took were normal pictures of us having fun sightseeing, so it's probably not anything like what Yui's expecting.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Fufu, in that case, I'll take one for you now. Hono-chan, hug up nice and close against Setouchi-san. Press your cheeks together too, and it'll look extra lovey dovey!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I-I can't do that out of nowhere-! It'd be embarrassing, right, Chii-nee?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Well, it is a little embarrassing, but since we are on a big trip, it might be nice to have photos like this too.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I guess so... Then, when in Rome! [hug-]!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Yeah, that pose looks perfect! I'm taking the picture now.

Since Yukari-sama did this, that means she had to have gotten some yummy food for us, right!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Mmmm, I can't wait!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I know what you mean, Mihono-chan.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Kanami-chan, Mihono-chan, it seems like they have dresses ready for us over there.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> She got us dresses too!? Let's go quick, Kanami!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah, wait up, Mihono-chan!?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> You don't have to be in such a rush you two; they have enough for everyone...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> They're already gone.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mai?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Oh, Sayaka-chan.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Kanami and Mihono were running.

Though, it's a little sad we couldn't have everyone from the investigation team come along to refresh themselves.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> We can't always get everyone together at once. There's missions to take care of.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> But Chii-nee and Mirja-san'll be coming, won't they?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Yeah.

About doing stuff for the Alliance.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Mmhm! After all, it's a lot of fun, getting to talk about fashion and beauty topics with everyone.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I like being able to chat a little when we're all together after a mission too.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah, I sorta get what you mean!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> And also, it gives me an chance to talk more with Juujou-san.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Do you and Juujou-san talk a lot? Ever since she joined the Alliance?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I'd already started talking with her a little because of a book. I lent it to her just a bit before the tournament.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Though, back then, Juujou-san sort of had this hard to approach feeling.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> But she isn't like that at all anymore lately. She texts me casually too.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> So that's how it is-.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Juujou-san's pretty interesting once you talk to her, isn't she.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Yeah. She has a kind of uniqueness to her. I think she's really nice.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That's why, I wanted us to get closer, so I was hoping Juujou-san might come along to the barbecue.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Since you go to school together, I'm sure you'll have a lot of other chances.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That's true.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Anyway, the meat that I'm bringing tomorrow is some really good stuff, so you should look forward to it-. I spent a lot of money on it-.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You went that far...

Though, the meat for tomorrow is beef!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> And I bet it's not going to lose to chicken!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Well, I'm looking forward to trying your meat, Hono-chan!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> The weather forecast said it'd be sunny, so it'll be perfect for barbecuing!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ahh, I wish it were tomorrow already-.  </p><h2 id="summer-uniform---mihono-end-isnt-meat-best-after-all" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Summer Uniform - Mihono: End]: Isn't Meat Best After All</h2><p>The day of the barbecue--</p><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> Okaaay, I think I'll grill up some meat!

Wh-What's up?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Hono-chan, your meat was so tasty that we were forgetting something important!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Wasn't our plan to eat what Chie-san and the others were eating, to learn the trick to getting bigger?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> If we eat any more meat, we won't have room for anything else.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Buttt... Everybody's eating meat, so maybe meat's the best thing to eat!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That's...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> It's a good idea, right?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I can't disagree with that...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...B-But, no. You almost got me, but, if meat is what we already have in common, then we have to try copying them with things besides meat!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ehh~... Ah, wait, hang on. Just the stuff I'm grilling right now then~... It'd be a waste otherwise!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It's not good to waste food, is it.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> So you get it! Meat's definitely good for growing!

You can make three teams of three, so it works out perfectly.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...!!<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Nah, we're good. That's a real nice offer, but we've got work to get back to.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Akira-san...<br><strong>Akira:</strong> ...Or I was thinking, but, if you're gonna extend the favor, we should have some fun after all!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> If we're in teams of three, we can just stay in the teams we're in, so we can play as soon as the mission's over!<br><strong>Park Manager:</strong> Then, I'll arrange for that. We would appreciate it if you would give us your impressions once you're done as well.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> That's a small price to pay. Thanks for having us!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I'll go let everybody know! And help them out too!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Good thing everybody was happy with it!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Fukki and Inami-san got mad at me for picking the teams for them though.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> But, I do think it's simplest doing the treasure hunt with the same teams we fought aradama with today.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> And it'd be annoying going out of our way to decide on new teams.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> We might be on different teams, but I'm glad I get to play with you, Hiyoyon. It's been a while since we got to do something like this.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Well... I am on the same team as Inami Suu and Kofuki. Can't say I'm not worried.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I predict Hiyoyon and her merry friends will be a tough team to beat!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ellen-san's team with Yui and Kiyoka seems tough too, but we aren't gonna lose-!<br><strong>Akira:</strong> You tell 'em, Mihono. Let's go find that treasure for ourselves!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Hmmm. What do you think the treasure pendants'll be like?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> That's one thing to look forward to, but what I really want to see to is everybody dressed like pirates!

Apparently it was a really small one though.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> And then Kofuki-san chased after it, leaving Inami-san alone in a dark model cave for a while.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ahh... Fukki... She would run off and leave her, wouldn't she.
