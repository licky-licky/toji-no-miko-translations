Aradama-chan-! Don't be shy-! C'mon out and play already-!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Kofuki.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...What?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Be quiet. I can't hear the aradama's movements.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Huhh? If they were that close, the spectrum finder'd tell us.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Man, today's not my day. Of all people, why'd you have to follow me around?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> It's an order.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Oh, is it really? I get that, Sayaka! But whenever you're around, you steal my kills! So just don't do anything today. Got that!?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Nn! In fact, you just head back home already. That way, I get all the aradama for me...<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> There...! Their numbers are a little more than predicted.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Fine by me, the more the merrier! Finally felt like showing yourselves, huh!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Looks like... 8 coming from the north, 5 coming from the south. Okay, I'll take north.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I'll go south.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> And don't mess with my aradama!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Kofuki. One of mine is headed north.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Leave it to me. C'mon, aradama! I love you too!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Two more, headed north.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Eh? F-Fine, I'll take care of it...<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Another one.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> H-Hey, Sayaka.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...You should be able to beat them, Kofuki. That's all that's left.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I don't really love aradama, so. If you want to fight them, I'll let you.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...H-Heheh! Sounds like you're finally getting it! Hear that! I get you all to myself, aradama-chan!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Pant... Too bad. It's already over, huh.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Then, let's take a break. Take a seat, Sayaka.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...Break? Were there too many aradama?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> No such thing. I could've kept going if I hadn't killed them all. You got that, right?<br><em>Kofuki sits down</em></p><p><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm. I thought you could beat them, so I sent them to you.<br><em>Sayaka moves over to Kofuki</em></p><p><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Kuku, you catch on quick. But, aren't you tired too?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ......<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> After you sent them all to me, I started getting extra careful not to screw up my stance or utsushi.<br><em>Sayaka sits down</em></p><p><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ......<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Ah, but it's not like I had to. I killed them all no sweat; not a scratch on me.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ......<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...Anyway, I didn't think you really weren't gonna do anything.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...... <em>smiling</em><br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> You know, you're not all that bad.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ......<br><em>Sayaka slumps into Kofuki</em></p><p><strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...Wha, are you sleeping...?

Ehhh!? Wh-Why're the aradama coming after me...!?<br><strong>Sumi:</strong> No way! No way, no way! Someone, h-help!!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I'll deal with the aradama on the right. You handle the left.<br><strong>Sumi:</strong> I-I-Itomi-san...! I can't! I was just supposed to be observing from the back today! I can't just start fighting like this!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...Okay. If any come after you, just try to stop them. Stay in the back.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...They're all taken care of.<br><strong>Sumi:</strong> Ahh, finally. Sorry, and thank you.<br><strong>Sumi:</strong> They said I'd just be observing, so I didn't expect real aradama to pop out at me like that. My hands are still shaking...<br><strong>Sumi:</strong> ...You're amazing, Itomi-san. You're seriously strong.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...<br><strong>Sumi:</strong> I can't believe we're in the same year. The way you moved, I couldn't do that. It really takes something special to fight on the front lines, huh.<br><strong>Sumi:</strong> I could never fight like that. Maybe I'm not cut out to be a toji...<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...Never? I think you just need to practice more.<br><strong>Sumi:</strong> Ugh... M-Mm. Maybe. I really should practice some more.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> You should commit to your attacks more too.<br><strong>Sumi:</strong> Ugh... You have a point there, I think.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> And you change stances too slowly.<br><strong>Sumi:</strong> Mm... You're right.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> And you're bad at keeping track of your surroundings.<br><strong>Sumi:</strong> Right... I knew it, but, it seems like all I have are bad points.<br><strong>Sumi:</strong> When I was chosen to be a member of the observation team, everyone just assumed I'd be strong because I'm so tall...<br><strong>Sumi:</strong> But with me like I am, if they send me on a mission... I don't think I could even cut an aradama.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...But you did cut one earlier.<br><strong>Sumi:</strong> Earlier? Ahh, I just got carried away. Cutting it was... Just a fluke.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I didn't think you were too bad with a sword.<br><strong>Sumi:</strong> Eh...?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Your swordsmanship was good. But, if you put more force into your swings, you'd do even better.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Then you need to change stances faster, and pay more attention to your surroundings.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Itomi-san...<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I practiced a lot, until I was able to do more and more. So I think you should practice a lot too.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Do you want to practice together sometime?<br><strong>Sumi:</strong> Eh, with me!?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm. Whenever I don't have a mission.<br><strong>Sumi:</strong> Do you really think I can improve?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm. You're lacking in a lot of areas, but I think so.<br><strong>Sumi:</strong> A... A lot, huh. But, thank you, Itomi-san. For encouraging me.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Eh...?<br><strong>Sumi:</strong> I feel a bit better. I'm looking forward to training together.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...O-Okay.  </p><h2 id="3-where-these-feelings-reach" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>3:　Where These Feelings Reach</h2><p><strong>Takatsu Yukina:</strong> ...Sayaka!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Ah... President Takatsu. I-<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> So you're back. The mission this time involved a fairly large scale aradama, but you defeated it rather easily, didn't you?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Ah, yes... Nothing went wrong...<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> Well done. Even Yukari-sama offered her praise. I'm very proud of you.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> And the elite guard looked so ashamed. Fufu. You really did well today.<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> Now, Sayaka. You must be tired, so rest.<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> Ah... That's right. Take this.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Eh...? A box of... Candy...?<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> Yes. It was delivered as a gift, but I have no interest in it. You should have them.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I-I...<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> Go ahead. The sugar should help you recover as well.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...Thank you, very much.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> P-President, um... I'm very happy...<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> Ahh, of course, you must be excited to sortie again. I wonder if I can't arrange something soon.<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> With my Renpu students constantly proving their usefulness, it's only a matter of time before Yukari-sama realizes the incompetence of her elite guard.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> The boorish Shidou Maki, that stuck up Konohana Suzuka, the impertinent Tsubakuro Yume, and--<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> That utterly worthless Yomi. I feel ashamed whenever I'm reminded she graduated from Renpu.<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> But don't worry, Sayaka. I won't allow you to turn out like that failure.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...Right.<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> You are the ultimate toji. The only one fit to guard Yukari-sama.<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> And, for that purpose, I need you to abandon any pointless feelings or desires. You cannot allow them to interfere with your duties.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ......<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> Now then, Sayaka, I'll speak to you later.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Abandon any... Pointless feelings.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> They're pointless...

Why are you resisting...!?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...I always did what you said. But...<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I can't... Be the toji you want me to be... No, I don't want to be.<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> What are... What are you saying...? Sayaka?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I thought I didn't mind being empty... But, ever since I met Mai, there's this heat inside me.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I don't want to lose this feeling. I want to be with Mai, who was kind to me.<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> ...Sayaka. You aren't a defective product like the elite guard. You are the successor to Myoho Muramasa.<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> In place of... On my behalf, you exist to serve Yukari-sama! To be a tool for her!?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Sayaka-chan! It's alright now!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mai... Why? Why did you come to save me...?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Because you're like a little sister to me!

I don't...)<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> Sayaka! That's enough selfishness!! Return to me now!!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> (I don't want... To lose this feeling.

Just bear with it a little.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Um...<br><strong>Sakura:</strong> Hm?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I might have... Been the one that hurt her.

They said they were experiencing trouble, and made a polite appeal, or rather, a request to us.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Ooh, there's more aradama-chan here!? Well aren't we lucky!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> No, it isn't that kind of trouble. They requested a stuntman for their film.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Huh?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...Stuntman?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> That's right.<br><strong>Assistant Director:</strong> Ah, it's a good thing you toji girls are here. A strange rumor started up that aradama show up in our studio, and it's been giving us problems... Serious problems.<br><strong>Assistant Director:</strong> They say there's a high chance of people getting hurt doing stunts here if any aradama come out. Stuntmen are turning us down... All of them, in fact.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> That doesn't mean it's something you ask us to do though. I'm not doing it either.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Shichinosato Kofuki, I understand your complaint. However, this is an issue that could be considered secondary damages caused by aradama.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Secondary damages?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Secondary damages can happen in a variety of ways. This would be considered a case of harmful misinformation.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Aradama are not commonly appearing here at the moment, but because that has happened in the past, as the director says, unfortunate rumors begin to arise.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> We won't be capable of supporting them for years to come, but, whenever possible, it should be our policy to assist them.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Damnit... Making me do the annoying jobs.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mai told me about it. We have to boost the image of toji.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> In simpler terms, that's exactly right.<br><strong>Assistant Director:</strong> With that cleared up, we'd like to ask you to be our stuntman...

It seems like the director had seen toji fighting aradama before, and came up with the idea for this request.<br><strong>Assistant Director:</strong> We can't afford to delay shooting any longer, and with our lack of time, budget, and suspicious circumstances, we can't arrange to find new stuntmen, so please!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...What should I do? Kofuki, Mirja...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Do whatever you want.

We can go over the details with them.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Who'd have thought she'd end up being in a movie, huh-. Even Sayaka must be pretty shocked right about now.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I'd imagine so. Though, I was somewhat surprised that Itomi Sayaka decided on it herself.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Well, yeah.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> And also, you have a fairly caring side yourself, to stay to look after her when we aren't even sure of when the filming will end.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> That's just cause, if I went back, it's not like there's anything to do there either.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I see.

It's amazing how you can be totally calm here.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> This is the second time for me. And also, this is an important mission.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> That's true. This will be my first time acting, but I'll do it as best as I can.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> According to the project outline and the script, it should be a horror action film.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> The plot features a pair of young nuns who go to exterminate a centuries old black cat demon living in a ruined mansion.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I'll be playing the younger nun.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Then that means, I'm the one who's playing the black cat demon?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Yes. I'm not sure exactly why you were chosen for the part, but that director is one to set his heart on something and not let go.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I think you'll be a cute black cat.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> But it's a horror movie... Is that really okay?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> That shouldn't be an issue. Judging from the photos of costumes that they sent us, they don't look designed to be scary.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> They're cute.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> The nun clothes have a stylish feeling to them. I bet they'd look good on you two.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Before the filming takes place, I plan to hold rehearsal sessions and briefing sessions with the director when there's time between missions.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Aradama suppression will be my highest priority of course, but I'll make my efforts here as well.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm. We should make the best use of our experience and bearing as toji.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Much like with their offer with the historical film, they must be expecting a similar kind of action from us.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> In that case, I think I might be able to do some of it.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Don't worry.
