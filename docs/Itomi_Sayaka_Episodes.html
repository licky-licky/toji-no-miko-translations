Aradama-chan-! Don't be shy-! C'mon out and play already-!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Kofuki.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...What?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Be quiet. I can't hear the aradama's movements.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Huhh? If they were that close, the spectrum finder'd tell us.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Man, today's not my day. Of all people, why'd you have to follow me around?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> It's an order.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Oh, is it really? I get that, Sayaka! But whenever you're around, you steal my kills! So just don't do anything today. Got that!?  
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Nn! In fact, you just head back home already. That way, I get all the aradama for me...<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> There...! Their numbers are a little more than predicted.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Fine by me, the more the merrier! Finally felt like showing yourselves, huh!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Looks like... 8 coming from the north, 5 coming from the south. Okay, I'll take north.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I'll go south.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> And don't mess with my aradama!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Kofuki. One of mine is headed north.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Leave it to me. C'mon, aradama! I love you too!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Two more, headed north.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Eh? F-Fine, I'll take care of it...<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Another one.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> H-Hey, Sayaka.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...You should be able to beat them, Kofuki. That's all that's left.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I don't really love aradama, so. If you want to fight them, I'll let you.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...H-Heheh! Sounds like you're finally getting it! Hear that! I get you all to myself, aradama-chan!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Pant... Too bad. It's already over, huh.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Then, let's take a break. Take a seat, Sayaka.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...Break? Were there too many aradama?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> No such thing. I could've kept going if I hadn't killed them all. You got that, right?<br><em>Kofuki sits down</em></p><p><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm. I thought you could beat them, so I sent them to you.<br><em>Sayaka moves over to Kofuki</em></p><p><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Kuku, you catch on quick. But, aren't you tired too?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ......<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> After you sent them all to me, I started getting extra careful not to screw up my stance or utsushi.<br><em>Sayaka sits down</em></p><p><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ......<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Ah, but it's not like I had to. I killed them all no sweat; not a scratch on me.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ......<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...Anyway, I didn't think you really weren't gonna do anything.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...... <em>smiling</em><br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> You know, you're not all that bad.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ......<br><em>Sayaka slumps into Kofuki</em></p><p><strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...Wha, are you sleeping...? Hey! Don't fall asleep on me! Sayaka!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Nn......<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> D-Don't look so peaceful... Hey, Sayaka!

Ehhh!? Wh-Why're the aradama coming after me...!?  
<strong>Sumi:</strong> No way! No way, no way! Someone, h-help!!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I'll deal with the aradama on the right. You handle the left.<br><strong>Sumi:</strong> I-I-Itomi-san...! I can't! I was just supposed to be observing from the back today! I can't just start fighting like this!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...Okay. If any come after you, just try to stop them. Stay in the back.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...They're all taken care of.<br><strong>Sumi:</strong> Ahh, finally. Sorry, and thank you.<br><strong>Sumi:</strong> They said I'd just be observing, so I didn't expect real aradama to pop out at me like that. My hands are still shaking...<br><strong>Sumi:</strong> ...You're amazing, Itomi-san. You're seriously strong.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...<br><strong>Sumi:</strong> I can't believe we're in the same year. The way you moved, I couldn't do that. It really takes something special to fight on the front lines, huh.<br><strong>Sumi:</strong> I could never fight like that. Maybe I'm not cut out to be a toji...<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...Never? I think you just need to practice more.<br><strong>Sumi:</strong> Ugh... M-Mm. Maybe. I really should practice some more.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> You should commit to your attacks more too.<br><strong>Sumi:</strong> Ugh... You have a point there, I think.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> And you change stances too slowly.<br><strong>Sumi:</strong> Mm... You're right.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> And you're bad at keeping track of your surroundings.<br><strong>Sumi:</strong> Right... I knew it, but, it seems like all I have are bad points.<br><strong>Sumi:</strong> When I was chosen to be a member of the observation team, everyone just assumed I'd be strong because I'm so tall...<br><strong>Sumi:</strong> But with me like I am, if they send me on a mission... I don't think I could even cut an aradama.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...But you did cut one earlier.<br><strong>Sumi:</strong> Earlier? Ahh, I just got carried away. Cutting it was... Just a fluke.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I didn't think you were too bad with a sword.<br><strong>Sumi:</strong> Eh...?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Your swordsmanship was good. But, if you put more force into your swings, you'd do even better.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Then you need to change stances faster, and pay more attention to your surroundings.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Itomi-san...<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I practiced a lot, until I was able to do more and more. So I think you should practice a lot too.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Do you want to practice together sometime?<br><strong>Sumi:</strong> Eh, with me!?  
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm. Whenever I don't have a mission.<br><strong>Sumi:</strong> Do you really think I can improve?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm. You're lacking in a lot of areas, but I think so.<br><strong>Sumi:</strong> A... A lot, huh. But, thank you, Itomi-san. For encouraging me.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Eh...?<br><strong>Sumi:</strong> I feel a bit better. I'm looking forward to training together.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...O-Okay.  </p><h2 id="3-where-these-feelings-reach" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>3:　Where These Feelings Reach</h2><p><strong>Takatsu Yukina:</strong> ...Sayaka!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Ah... President Takatsu. I-<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> So you're back. The mission this time involved a fairly large scale aradama, but you defeated it rather easily, didn't you?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Ah, yes... Nothing went wrong...<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> Well done. Even Yukari-sama offered her praise. I'm very proud of you.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> And the elite guard looked so ashamed. Fufu. You really did well today.<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> Now, Sayaka. You must be tired, so rest.<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> Ah... That's right. Take this.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Eh...? A box of... Candy...?<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> Yes. It was delivered as a gift, but I have no interest in it. You should have them.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I-I...<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> Go ahead. The sugar should help you recover as well.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...Thank you, very much.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> P-President, um... I'm very happy...<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> Ahh, of course, you must be excited to sortie again. I wonder if I can't arrange something soon.<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> With my Renpu students constantly proving their usefulness, it's only a matter of time before Yukari-sama realizes the incompetence of her elite guard.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> The boorish Shidou Maki, that stuck up Konohana Suzuka, the impertinent Tsubakuro Yume, and--<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> That utterly worthless Yomi. I feel ashamed whenever I'm reminded she graduated from Renpu.<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> But don't worry, Sayaka. I won't allow you to turn out like that failure.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...Right.<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> You are the ultimate toji. The only one fit to guard Yukari-sama.<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> And, for that purpose, I need you to abandon any pointless feelings or desires. You cannot allow them to interfere with your duties.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ......<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> Now then, Sayaka, I'll speak to you later.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Abandon any...

Why are you resisting...!?

But, ever since I met Mai, there's this heat inside me.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I don't want to lose this feeling. I want to be with Mai, who was kind to me.<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> ...Sayaka. You aren't a defective product like the elite guard. You are the successor to Myoho Muramasa.<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> In place of... On my behalf, you exist to serve Yukari-sama! To be a tool for her!?  
<strong>Mai:</strong> Sayaka-chan! It's alright now!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mai... Why? Why did you come to save me...?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Because you're like a little sister to me!

I hadn't heard you'd been injured...? Where are you hurt?<br><strong>Sakura:</strong> ...Ah!<br><strong>Sakura:</strong> A cat... Where'd you find her?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> When I was on the suppression mission... The surrounding area was damaged--<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I think, she was nearby and got hurt. W-When I went to see her later, she was in pain...<br><strong>Sakura:</strong> I see... You're right... She's not doing well.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I didn't know where to go, so, I came here.<br><strong>Sakura:</strong> I understand, Sayka-chan. I've never worked on a cat before... But I'll do everything I can...!<br><strong>Sakura:</strong> First, I need to clean the wound... Sorry, kitty. Just bear with it a little.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Um...<br><strong>Sakura:</strong> Hm?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I might have... Been the one that hurt her. I blocked everything out while I was fighting, and when it was over, I found her.<br><strong>Sakura:</strong> Working as a toji is a matter of life and death, after all...<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...Will she die?<br><strong>Sakura:</strong> Eh?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Because of the injury. Is she going... To die...<br><strong>Sakura:</strong> Sayaka-chan... Don't say that.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Please save her. Please.<br><strong>Sakura:</strong> I know you're worried. But, it's okay. I don't think the wound is that deep.<br><strong>Sakura:</strong> The cut was really messy, so I was a little shocked... But see, it's looking better now.<br><strong>Sakura:</strong> See, kitty? You're safe now.<br><strong>Cat:</strong> Meow<br><strong>Sakura:</strong> Ahh, she must be hungry too. She'll be doing better after she gets something to eat.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> What do cats eat...?<br><strong>Sakura:</strong> ...Cat food, I think?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Where... Can I buy that?<br><strong>Sakura:</strong> Probably everywhere? At convenience stores, at least.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I'll buy some...!<br><strong>Sakura:</strong> Fufu.

I don't know what I'm supposed to do.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> I know you want to make up with her. But, why did you do something reckless like fighting the aradama by yourself?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Because I want to be stronger. So nobody has to go through anything painful.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Well, Mai said she's worried about you too.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mai did...?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> She isn't... Mad at me?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> I mean, of course she's mad when you put yourself in danger.

Well aren't we lucky!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> No, it isn't that kind of trouble. They requested a stuntman for their film.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Huh?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...Stuntman?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> That's right.<br><strong>Assistant Director:</strong> Ah, it's a good thing you toji girls are here. A strange rumor started up that aradama show up in our studio, and it's been giving us problems... Serious problems.<br><strong>Assistant Director:</strong> They say there's a high chance of people getting hurt doing stunts here if any aradama come out. Stuntmen are turning us down... All of them, in fact.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> That doesn't mean it's something you ask us to do though. I'm not doing it either.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Shichinosato Kofuki, I understand your complaint. However, this is an issue that could be considered secondary damages caused by aradama.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Secondary damages?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Secondary damages can happen in a variety of ways. This would be considered a case of harmful misinformation.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Aradama are not commonly appearing here at the moment, but because that has happened in the past, as the director says, unfortunate rumors begin to arise.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> We won't be capable of supporting them for years to come, but, whenever possible, it should be our policy to assist them.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Damnit... Making me do the annoying jobs.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mai told me about it. We have to boost the image of toji.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> In simpler terms, that's exactly right.<br><strong>Assistant Director:</strong> With that cleared up, we'd like to ask you to be our stuntman...

We can go over the details with them.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Who'd have thought she'd end up being in a movie, huh-.
