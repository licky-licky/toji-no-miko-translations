There&#x27;s a team event starting! They&#x27;re calling it the White Day Wars!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> For some reason, they found aradama carrying candies and marshmallows. So they put together a competition to defeat and collect them!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I just found out about it myself! They said we can form our own teams with anyone from any school, and whoever gets the most sweets wins.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> And, more importantly, the winning team gets some kind of awesome secret prize!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Even if we&#x27;re not directly competing, it still sounds pretty fun! So, want to team up, Mihono-chan?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Course I do! Let&#x27;s go around and see if anyone else wants to join us!<br>
<strong>Ban Tsugumi:</strong> Now then, the cookies and macarons are ready. Please eat them, Shichinosato-san.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> I still don&#x27;t get why you made these, but if you&#x27;re giving then I&#x27;ll take &#x27;em. (chew chew, chew chew...)<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...Mmmm... There&#x27;s this weird... Grassy? Taste to the cookies. And these macarons kinda taste like medicine.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Have you noticed any changes to your body yet? To tell the truth, I mixed several things into them while I was cooking.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Barley grass juice, protein powder, coconut oil, chia seeds, acai pulp, along with...<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Well no shit it tastes awful!! What&#x27;re you gonna do if this stuff messes me up!?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Everything I put in there should be good for you. Though knowing you, you&#x27;ll be fine, Shichinosato-san. And like they say, failure is the path to success.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> If you thought it&#x27;d fail, then don&#x27;t give it to me!! Use yourself if you want a test subject!! I&#x27;m never eating anything you cook ever again!!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> &#x27;Scuse us! Are you two busy right now? I wanted to ask you about the White Day Wars...<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Ah, you came at just the right time. I made these sweets, so...<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Stop, dumbass!!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> --Anyway, we&#x27;re looking for people to join our team! Did either of you say you&#x27;d help anybody else yet?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I haven&#x27;t. Actually, this is the first I&#x27;ve heard of any White Day Wars.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Same. But I&#x27;m always down to kill some aradama. Don&#x27;t need any kind of prize besides that.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> So anyway, I&#x27;m joining as a one man team! That way I get all the aradama to myself!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> That&#x27;s how Shichinosato-san is... Now that I think of it, I did receive instructions to investigate the candy carrying aradama.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> So do you mind if I join you, Shichinosato-san?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Fine, whatever! Just don&#x27;t mess with me anymore!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> ...Fufufu. I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing what sort of effect those sweets have on her in combat.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> And they&#x27;re gone... Well, we can&#x27;t afford to lose to them! We&#x27;ll just have to look for allies while we&#x27;re out there fighting!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> ...Kaoru, did you hear? It sounds like there&#x27;s some big fun event going on?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Fun? You sure you don&#x27;t mean annoying?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> What are you saying! They&#x27;re all turning it into a competition! Of course it&#x27;ll be fun!<br>
<strong>Nene:</strong> Ne-!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> See, Nene&#x27;s getting into it too! We should make a team together, Kaoru! Let&#x27;s start getting candy right away!!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="2-mai-and-sayaka-and-making-cookies"></a>2: Mai and Sayaka and Making Cookies<a class="hash-link" href="#2-mai-and-sayaka-and-making-cookies" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Kanami:</strong> It&#x27;s a good thing we got Mai-chan and Sayaka-chan on our team. With the two of you here, we&#x27;re unstoppable!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I think you might be getting your hopes too high...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> But we&#x27;ve already gotten so many sweets!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> So what&#x27;d we come to the cooking classroom for, anyway?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Well, I thought candy and marshmallows alone were too depressing. Since it&#x27;s White Day, we should make cookies too.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> -! Cookies...! Mai, I&#x27;ll help.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I&#x27;d appreciate it! Can you start sifting wheat flour for me, Sayaka-chan?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Sift...?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> This is a sifter. You pour it in the top, and it makes the flour much lighter. Do you think you can handle that?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Understood. I&#x27;ll do it.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah! They just updated the competition rankings!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Let&#x27;s see... Looks like a lot of toji joined in!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> First place right now is... Shichinosato-san and Ban-san&#x27;s team!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Just two people made it to first!? Nobody beats Fukki when it comes to getting rid of aradama, I guess.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> And Ellen-chan and Kaoru-chan&#x27;s team are in second!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> It&#x27;s a little hard to picture that from the carefree Ellen-chan and lazy Kaoru-chan.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ahaha, you&#x27;re right.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mai, I sifted it all.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Thanks! Next, I need the batter... Ah, Sayaka-chan, your cheek&#x27;s all white with flour?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Come here, I&#x27;ll wipe it off for you.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Nn...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> We&#x27;re only in fourth place... We&#x27;re going to need more people if we want to stand a chance of getting that prize!<br>
<em>everyone&#x27;s phones ring</em><br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> --Bad news! They just sent out an alert for another aradama sighting! We&#x27;ve gotta get going!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mai, the cookies...<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> We&#x27;ll have to leave them now and finish cooking later, okay?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Okay!<br>
<strong>Kamo Chinami:</strong> So those four went and started baking sweets? Looking pretty girly in here~. I could start taking notes!<br>
<strong>Chinami:</strong> --Ahh! That reminds me, Chinatsu-chan and Hoozuki-chan asked me for some White Day lessons! I&#x27;d better go see them as soon as these aradama are dealt with!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="3-chinami-senseis-white-day-lecture"></a>3: Chinami-sensei&#x27;s White Day Lecture<a class="hash-link" href="#3-chinami-senseis-white-day-lecture" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Terashimo Hoozuki:</strong> Working as both a toji and a magazine model, with her scabbard looking cute as ever today, Chinami-sensei is here to answer our questions!<br>
<strong>Hoozuki:</strong> To get things started, when it comes to White Day, I&#x27;d like to do something a little different from everyone else! Do you have any advice, Chinami-sensei-?<br>
<strong>Chinami:</strong> I get complimented a lot in my line of work, but you&#x27;re the only one who always admires my scabbard, Hoozuki-chan. A future lacquerer&#x27;s got that special attention to detail, after all!<br>
<strong>Chinami:</strong> So anyway, back to your question, it&#x27;s nice to change things up, but being different for the sake of difference isn&#x27;t going to work!<br>
<strong>Chinami:</strong> What&#x27;s most important is choosing something that suits you and you&#x27;re comfortable with! Try starting with something you already like as a motif!<br>
<strong>Hoozuki:</strong> I get it! So what if I put on some scabbard cosplay, and hand out scabbard shaped cookies!<br>
<strong>Chinami:</strong> You sure you&#x27;re not thinking of Halloween?<br>
<strong>Shimoishii Chinatsu:</strong> I have a question for you too, Chinami-sensei.<br>
<strong>Chinatsu:</strong> I&#x27;ve never baked any sweets before, so do you have any advice on how to not screw up for White Day?<br>
<strong>Chinami:</strong> You&#x27;ve always so busy studying after all, Chinatsu-chan. Even though you&#x27;re in the swordsmith department, don&#x27;t you sit in on lectures for the engineering and research departments?<br>
<strong>Chinatsu:</strong> Yes. I&#x27;m no good at dealing with free time. So I try to fill it with learning as much as possible...!<br>
<strong>Chinami:</strong> A busybody like you doesn&#x27;t have to force herself to make anything. You can buy something nice from from a store, you know?<br>
<strong>Chinami:</strong> If your sweets don&#x27;t turn out the way you want them, I&#x27;d hate to see you depressed over losing both time and ingredients.<br>
<strong>Hoozuki:</strong> I see!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> No wonder Chinami-sensei has a lot of female fans. I feel like I&#x27;m learning a lot!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Me, me! I have a question too! How are you planning on spending your White Day, Chinami-sensei?<br>
<strong>Chinami:</strong> ...Well in my case, February and March are sort of a trial. Like she said, I have a lot of female fans.<br>
<strong>Chinami:</strong> And so many of them send in chocolates and sweets for Valentines and White Day.<br>
<strong>Chinami:</strong> I don&#x27;t even want to think about the calories from eating them all, but with everyone&#x27;s feelings baked into them, I can&#x27;t exactly give those sweets to anyone else, you know?<br>
<strong>Chinami:</strong> Plus, as a model, I need to watch my figure, so actually I&#x27;m on an extra strict diet right now...<br>
<strong>Hoozuki:</strong> I&#x27;d expect no less from you, Sensei! Fighting the calories, you still eat all of them! That gentlemanly side of you is so charming!<br>
<strong>Koike Saaya:</strong> Excuse me. I&#x27;m Koike Saaya, a third year high schooler with the Heijou Institute&#x27;s patrol department! Another group of aradama have just been sighted, so we need all toji to prepare to sortie!<br>
<strong>Chinami:</strong> --Well then. How does aradama extermination sound for burning some calories?<br>
<strong>Chinatsu:</strong> Chinami-sensei! I&#x27;ll give you backup!<br>
<strong>Chinami:</strong> Okay! I&#x27;ll count on you! And, Kanami-chan and Mihono-chan? Is it okay if I tag along with your team?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Of course! We&#x27;d love to have you!<br>
<strong>Saaya:</strong> ...The White Day Wars. It seems like there&#x27;s already a huge stockpile of candy and marshmallows gathered from aradama.<br>
<strong>Saaya:</strong> But I&#x27;d like to give everyone a taste of something a little better. I&#x27;ll just add a special ingredient~.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="4-after-the-sour-konbu-culprit"></a>4: After the Sour Konbu Culprit!<a class="hash-link" href="#4-after-the-sour-konbu-culprit" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Kanami:</strong> We sure pulled in a lot of candy and marshmallows, huh. It takes a while for just two people to move around.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Let&#x27;s see, we&#x27;re supposed to leave what we won&#x27;t eat in the storeroom, right?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Whoa! There&#x27;s so many sweets in here!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> They told everyone to freely drop them off, so it looks like they&#x27;ve been piling up one after another.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> --There we go. Now that that&#x27;s taken care of, we should meet back up with the others.<br>
<em>Kanami and Mihono leave</em><br>
<strong>Koike Saaya:</strong> ...Fufu. Looks like more sweets have been delivered.<br>
<strong>Saaya:</strong> Then I&#x27;ll get right to it. Just have to swap these in with the candies--<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Now!! Grab the suspect!!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Give it up!!<br>
<em>Kanami and Mihono bust in and grab Saaya</em><br>
<strong>Saaya:</strong> -!? But you left!?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> We made a lot of extra noise as we were leaving, then quietly came back in!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> We heard reports the candy stored here had some weird sour taste.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> But it&#x27;s not like they could go bad that fast. We thought something was up, so we stayed on guard. And that&#x27;s when you came sneaking in, Saaya-san.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Saaya-san! Answer us! Why are you mixing sour konbu in with the candies!? That&#x27;s really mean for a prank!<br>
<strong>Saaya:</strong> P-Prank!? Sweets and sour konbu go hand in hand like perfect matrimony! Don&#x27;t you feel the same way!?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...M-Mattremoney?<br>
<strong>Saaya:</strong> It means marriage in French~. When the two combine, their flavors enhance each other.<br>
<strong>Saaya:</strong> I was only giving everyone a taste of something better!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> ...Saaya-san, please listen carefully. Candy and sour konbu don&#x27;t go together at all.<br>
<strong>Saaya:</strong> Hmph! That&#x27;s not true...! Everyone knows sweet and sour things have high affinity for each other...<br>
<strong>Saaya:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Saaya:</strong> ... ...... .........<br>
<strong>Saaya:</strong> ...Ah, you&#x27;re right. This tastes terrible.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> You never even tried it!?<br>
<strong>Saaya:</strong> Well, I eat a lot of sour konbu on its own, so...<br>
<strong>Saaya:</strong> But there are lots of people who won&#x27;t eat it, so I thought if I mixed it in with the candy they&#x27;d start realizing how great it tastes...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Basically, you just thought you were helping out...<br>
<strong>Saaya:</strong> What a heartbreaking incident...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> You don&#x27;t get to say that!<br>
<em>phone rings</em><br>
<strong>Saaya:</strong> --Headquarters is contacting me! There&#x27;s reports of more aradama sightings!<br>

If an aradama showed up right now, I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;d be able to escape from under here again~.<br>
<strong>Mizushina Kinuka:</strong> That&#x27;s no good~. But kotatsu have magic that makes you powerless the moment you enter them, after all~.<br>
<strong>Nao:</strong> You get it, Mizushina-san~. Here, eat some oranges.<br>
<strong>Kinuka:</strong> Don&#x27;t go pushing unpeeled oranges in my face! But thank you, I will~.<br>
<strong>Kinuka:</strong> Anyway, everybody sure seems to be getting all worked up over these White Day Wars~. Not like it has anything to do with us tucked away in here though~.<br>
<strong>Nao:</strong> But it&#x27;s doing a nice job of raising morale, isn&#x27;t it~. Speaking of which, what are the rankings like now?<br>
<strong>Kinuka:</strong> Let&#x27;s see. Seems like first place is still Shichinosato-san and Ban-san. Their lead just keeps pulling farther ahead of the others.<br>
<strong>Kinuka:</strong> Shichinosato-san seems to be in unusually good condition to be going at those aradama so enthusiastically. Could they be doping?<br>
<strong>Kinuka:</strong> In second place is Kohagura-san&#x27;s team. Though with the slacker Mashiko-san with her, they seem to be struggling to compete.<br>
<strong>Nao:</strong> That girl never changes. Though, when it comes to a volunteer event like this, I can sort of understand how she feels~.<br>
<strong>Nao:</strong> And I can&#x27;t exactly say the prize is worth the effort either~.<br>
<strong>Kinuka:</strong> Uraga-san, you know what the winner gets?<br>
<strong>Nao:</strong> Ara, you mean you don&#x27;t know, Mizushina-san? If you come in first... Ah, your phone&#x27;s ringing~.<br>
<strong>Kinuka:</strong> ...Understood! We&#x27;ll be there right away.<br>
<strong>Kinuka:</strong> --That was an urgent request. More aradama have appeared. Uraga-san, it seems we&#x27;re needed.<br>
<strong>Nao:</strong> I see, a swarm of aradama have been sighted in northeastern Izu. Reports from the scene say there could be up to one hundred of them. Several larger aradama were seen as well.<br>
<strong>Kinuka:</strong> There&#x27;s quite a lot this time, isn&#x27;t there? Civilians in the area-- Seem to have practiced evacuation drills.<br>
<strong>Nao:</strong> Then start studying the local topography and figuring out who to send where, miss strategic director.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="6-the-feelings-baked-into-sweets"></a>6: The Feelings Baked into Sweets<a class="hash-link" href="#6-the-feelings-baked-into-sweets" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> The first annual! &quot;Forget About the Teams, Let&#x27;s All Bake Sweets Together&quot; meetup~!<br>

<strong>Kanami:</strong> And guiding us today is none other than the eldest daughter of the Yanase Group, the patissier prodigy herself, Mai-chan!<br>

<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Do you not like baking, Shichinosato-san?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Besides hunting aradama, nothing&#x27;s really any fun. And what&#x27;s the point of all this cooking when it ends up the same in your stomach anyway? Might as well just eat it like this.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That&#x27;s not true! The greatest flavoring of all is a girl&#x27;s feelings as she bakes them into her cooking!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> The feelings you have when you think about the person who&#x27;ll be eating it make it so much tastier!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Tch... Fine, whatever. There&#x27;s nothing better to do, so I&#x27;ll give it a shot.<br>

<strong>Kanami:</strong> Mihono-chan! We have to get Musumi-san to work with us! So let&#x27;s give it our best shot!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Why&#x27;re you getting into this, Kanami!?<br>
<em>everyone&#x27;s phones ring</em><br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah-! O-Oh no-! Looks like more aradama showed up! Guess we need to get going, huh-!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I won&#x27;t let you get out of this, Hono-chan! If aradama showed up, then you&#x27;ll just have to confess while you&#x27;re fighting!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> While we&#x27;re fighting!? How do you expect me to pull that off!?  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="8-white-day-wars-concluded"></a>8: White Day Wars, Concluded!<a class="hash-link" href="#8-white-day-wars-concluded" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Kanami:</strong> They&#x27;re finally publishing the results of the White Day Wars. I&#x27;m getting goosebumps...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Thanks to Kiyoka joining us, we managed to haul in tons of sweets towards the end! We might&#x27;ve pulled off a big reversal...!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Hono-chan, I helped you out, so you have to let me see your confession after, remember?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I-I don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re talking about~...<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> We held first place through most of the competition, but I&#x27;m not sure about the results... Shichinosato-san only went after larger aradama in the second half, so our numbers could have fallen behind...<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Even after my sweets gave you a boost too...<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> It&#x27;s not like I care about this ranking stuff anyway. I got to kill a ton of aradama, so I&#x27;m satisfied.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Ahahaha! Look, Kaoru! Nene took all the marshmallows we found and made a sofa out of them!<br>
<strong>Nene:</strong> Ne-! Ne-!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> What&#x27;s so fun about that... And you&#x27;d better eat all those marshmallows when you&#x27;re done.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Don&#x27;t worry about it! I&#x27;m sure the staff will take care of it!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> What staff?<br>
<strong>Nao:</strong> ...Excuse me, is everyone here? I&#x27;m not sure why, but Mizushina-san and I have been asked to announce the results of the White Day Wars.<br>
<strong>Kinuka:</strong> Thank you for all your hard work, everyone. Despite the many sightings of aradama, we were able to deal with them without civilian casualties.<br>
<strong>Nao:</strong> All because of how quickly you were able to dispatch and suppress aradama as they appeared. Really, thank you all.<br>
<strong>Nao:</strong> And with that, I&#x27;ll now announce the first place winner. The overall winner of the first White Day Wars is... Kohagura Ellen&#x27;s Team!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> ---!? We did it!! We did it, Kaoru!! Our team won!!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong>  Who&#x27;d have guessed. Looks like it was worth getting dragged along by you.<br>
<strong>Nene :</strong> Ne-!! Ne-!!<br>
<strong>Kinuka:</strong> Congratulations. As a reward for their victory, all the sweets in the storeroom will be delivered to Ellen-san&#x27;s team!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> ...Eh? All the sweets? Aren&#x27;t you just dumping the leftovers on us...?<br>
<strong>Nao:</strong> I should mention, by the way, that you can&#x27;t refuse this offer.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Are you serious!? What are we supposed do with a year&#x27;s worth of candy and marshmallows!?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Tell me this is a joke... I really shouldn&#x27;t have bothered with this in the first place...<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Our team only placed third in the end. Thank goodness we didn&#x27;t win. Shichinosato-san made the right call.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> We came in second! We were so close to first place; that&#x27;s so frustrating...!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I&#x27;m a little frustrated too, but since we were this close to having our rooms filled wall to wall with candy and marshmallows, I think it turned out for the best?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> More importantly, Hono-chan, hurry up and do your confession--<br>
<strong>Kinuka:</strong> Ah, everyone, may I have your attention for a moment? I said this earlier, but thanks to everyone&#x27;s efforts, not a single civilian was harmed. That really is a remarkable achievement.<br>
<strong>Kinuka:</strong> And so, in case this happens next year, I look forward to all of you participating in the White Day Wars again.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Alright!! We&#x27;re gonna win for sure next time-!!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> I&#x27;ve had enough of candy and marshmallows for one lifetime! Get a real prize if you want us to do this again!</p></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="theme-doc-footer-edit-meta-row row"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations/edit/docs/Team_vs_Team_in_the_White_Day_Wars.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="theme-edit-this-page"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_2_ui" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_13-_"></div></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"></div></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_35-E thin-scrollbar"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#1-white-day-wars-commence" class="table-of-contents__link">1: White Day Wars, Commence</a></li><li><a href="#2-mai-and-sayaka-and-making-cookies" class="table-of-contents__link">2: Mai and Sayaka and Making Cookies</a></li><li><a href="#3-chinami-senseis-white-day-lecture" class="table-of-contents__link">3: Chinami-sensei&#39;s White Day Lecture</a></li><li><a href="#4-after-the-sour-konbu-culprit" class="table-of-contents__link">4: After the Sour Konbu Culprit!</a></li><li><a href="#5-kotatsu-roundtable" class="table-of-contents__link">5: Kotatsu Roundtable</a></li><li><a href="#6-the-feelings-baked-into-sweets" class="table-of-contents__link">6: The Feelings Baked into Sweets</a></li><li><a href="#7-kiyokas-confession" class="table-of-contents__link">7: Kiyoka&#39;s Confession!?</a></li><li><a href="#8-white-day-wars-concluded" class="table-of-contents__link">8: White Day Wars, Concluded!</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Links</div><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://pastebin.com/LdyviZ8Z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Translator anon&#x27;s pastebin<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Site source code<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Built with Docusaurus.</div></div></div></footer></div>
