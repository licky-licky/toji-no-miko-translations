But there's no mistaking they're in the area...<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> .........<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Wanna take a break? At this rate, we'll be worn out by the time we do find them.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Don't. This amount of exercise shouldn't be enough to tire any of us, should it?<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> ...<br><strong>Minato:</strong> But the weather's so nice... Yawwwwn, 'scuse me.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Get your act together, Minato-senpai! Why are you so unmotivated?<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Ehh, but I've got lots of motivation...<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Start taking this seriously.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> I am though. Ah, the spectrum meter found something!<br><strong>Minato:</strong> C'mon, Yukari, Kagari!<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Ah, stay with us, Minato-senpai!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Sigh, Minato... Let's go, Kagari.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> ...Right.<br>The next day.</p><p><strong>Yukari:</strong> Finally, there you are. So you were sleeping out here.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Nnn... Morning, Yukari. The sun feels so good. Wanna join me?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Sigh, I already expect this from you, but... Kagari is still upset, you know?<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Ehhh, but I beat the aradama and everything...<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> While you ran off on your own. What did Kagari tell you yesterday?<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Uh... That I had no motivation. Is that really how it seems?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> I wouldn't say you aren't serious, but you do appear too apathetic.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Suppressing aradama is an important duty. Just knowing what you're capable of... I can understand how Kagari feels.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> You're kind of putting me on the spot here.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> I said it yesterday, but it's not like I'm not motivated. I'm taking this seriously.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> I guess it's just hard to tell from how I act?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Then make an effort to show it, if even just slightly more.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> I'll give it my best shot.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Anyway, that's gonna be starting soon, isn't it, Yukari!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> That... The inter-league tournament?<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Yeah! I wonder who's gonna be participating this year? We'll get to fight girls we wouldn't normally get matches with!<br><strong>Minato:</strong> I already can't wait!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> ...Try putting that enthusiasm into your duties.  </p><h2 id="2-what-i-like" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>2: What I Like</h2><p><strong>Minato:</strong> Excuse meee, anyone around...? Alright! Let's get cooking!<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Hmhmhmm~.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Mmm~, the cup yakisoba's good to go! Just have to wait 3 minutes now!<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Nobody can fight on an empty stomach.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> It's tough training with Yukari, so I've gotta eat up first!<br><strong>Minato:</strong> ...Still not ready?<br><strong>Minato:</strong> One minute......... Two minutes...<br><strong>Minato:</strong> It's a little early, but whatever!<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Pour out the water, mix in the sauce... Mmm~! That smell!<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Time to dig i--<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Minato... Are you in here?<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Geh, Yukari!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> How nice of you to greet your friend with "Geh".<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Knowing you, I assumed you had forgotten our promise to train together... But that reaction says otherwise.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> D-Did I remember, or maybe I forgot, who can say...<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> It doesn't matter now. Let's go; I have some strict training for you.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Hang on! It's my fault I was late to training! But, before we go... Give me enough time to eat this!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> I knew I smelled something... Is that cup yakisoba?<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Freshly made, nice and steamy, cup yakisoba! So please... Let it slide just this once, Yukari.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> I do know how you feel. Cup yakisoba is the best when it's freshly made.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> It loses its taste after it cools down.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Then...!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> However, that doesn't change your promise. Our training should be most important to you right now, shouldn't it?<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Ugh, I can't deny that...<br><strong>Minato:</strong> (What should I do; at this rate the yakisoba will cool off and quickly lose its flavor...!!)<br><strong>Minato:</strong> (And I don't want to eat any gross yakisoba! If it comes down to it...!)<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Yukari... Sorry about this!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Mrgh! ...(chew chew)<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Alright, now's my chance...! (slurrrrrrrrrp)<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> (gulp) ...What are you doing, Minato?<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Ahaha... I thought you'd forgive me if I gave you a bite?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> You can't call shoving it into my mouth giving me a bite.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> But it was good, right?<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Have you ever had cup yakisoba since that time in middle school... When you ran away from home?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Actually... I've been eating it often.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Seriously!?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Secretly, when I could hide it.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> It's difficult to tell anyone I'm eating cup yakisoba.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> No way... Then, next time we train together, we should get cup yakisoba too!<br><strong>Minato:</strong> We'll stick with that!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> ...Good. I'll look forward to it.  </p><h2 id="3-the-inside-story-of-the-enforced-regulation" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>3: The Inside Story of the Enforced Regulation</h2><p><strong>Minato:</strong> Is this Shikishima Bank? Somebody's supposed to be holed up in there.<br><strong>Policeman:</strong> Yes, but... Ah, did you hear about it on the news? You shouldn't be here, it's dangerous. Run on home.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Uhh, I caught some of the news, but I'm the toji who came on behalf of the Special Sword Administration Bureau.<br><strong>Policeman:</strong> Huh? A toji? J-Just wait right here!<br><strong>Police Inspector:</strong> You say you're the toji the Special Sword Administration Bureau dispatched...?<br><strong>Minato:</strong> That's me.<br><strong>Police Inspector:</strong> You seem a little young...<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Well, I am a toji, so that's pretty normal. I'm Fujiwara Minato, a 2nd year at Renpu Middle School.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> I've been sent here on behalf of the Special Sword Administration Bureau to resolve the Shikishima Bank Siege Incident.<br><strong>Police Inspector:</strong> They sent a middle schooler here to fight!? Has the Special Sword Administration Bureau lost their minds!?<br><strong>Police Inspector:</strong> They could have at least gotten a high school student...!<br><strong>Minato:</strong> A high schooler's just 2 years older; it's not that big a difference. And besides, the police are the ones who asked for a toji, right? That's what I heard.<br><strong>Police Inspector:</strong> The man in there is armed. We can't let a kid like you go anywhere near!<br><strong>Police Inspector:</strong> In the 30 hours since the case started, there's been one casualty after another. We can't afford to stand by and let another happen.<br><strong>Police Inspector:</strong> We'll request a change of personnel right away. Sorry it turned out like this just after you got here, but please go home.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Ah, you don't have to do anything like that.<br><strong>Police Inspector:</strong> What?<br><strong>Minato:</strong> I'll be finished here in a minute.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Mannn, it was pretty crazy back then... They kept saying "Go home, middle schooler!"<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> ...Sigh, of course they did. Do you understand what happened after that, Minato-senpai?<br><strong>Minato:</strong> What happened? Well I got a little famous, right? It's not that big a deal, Kagari.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Not a big deal... We're talking about the Shikishima Bank Siege Incident, you know!?<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Do you have any idea what a thrashing the media gave the police for sending a middle school girl in there!?<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Ohh, that.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> I'm the one who said I was going in, so they were really barking up the wrong tree there.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> The police were hardly clear of blame either, when it seems they were hoping the criminal would let his guard down if a child came after him.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> But the police officer there was really worried about me, you know?<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Likely because the officers at the scene hadn't been told what their superiors were planning.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> ...Did you know that, as a result of that incident, a regulation was put in place saying the Special Sword Administration Bureau could no longer intervene in any non-aradama related cases?<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Really?<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> ......Sighhhhh.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Please at least try to consider the repercussions of your actions, Minato-senpai...  </p><h2 id="4-amusement-park" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>4: Amusement Park</h2><p><strong>Minato:</strong> We're at the amusement park! Yukari! Yukari! What do you want to ride first?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> You're getting too worked up, Minato.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> But we finally got to come to the amusement park! What's the point if we're not getting worked up?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> ...Is that how this works?<br><strong>Minato:</strong> That's exactly how it works!<br><strong>Minato:</strong> So, so? What do you wanna ride, Yukari? I think we should try the rollercoaster!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> I'll leave it up to you. We can ride that first.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Alright-!<br><strong>Minato:</strong> That was great-! Wasn't it, Yukari!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Yes, and because it's designed for the general public, it didn't put much burden on your body.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Yukari... Is that really all you have to say about the rollercoaster?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> When you ask me like that, I'm not sure what kind of opinion I'm meant to have.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Hmm... Yukari, do you have fun at amusement parks?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> I'm not sure how to respond to that. I don't often come to places like this.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> So I'm not sure how to have fun here either.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Huh? But don't you start getting excited just being at an amusement park?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Do you?<br><strong>Minato:</strong> You do!<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Alright, today is a holiday, and you aren't here to do an inspection. Got it?<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Which means nobody's stopping you from having all the fun you want!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> ...I see. You're right, Minato. Please teach me how to have fun at an amusement park.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Sure thing! Just leave it all to me!<br><strong>Minato:</strong> I'll give a lecture on how to enjoy every square inch of the amusement park!<br><strong>Minato:</strong> First off, we're getting back on the rollercoaster! While we're riding this time, try letting out a big scream!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> A scream... I'll try it.<br><strong>Minato/Yukari:</strong> KYAAAAAA------!!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Amazing. All I did was scream, but it was so much more exciting this time...! I suppose it's something you can't understand until you try it yourself.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> What will we ride next, Minato?<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Okay, next up is a classic, the teacup ride! Come on, Yukari! I'll show you all kinds of exciting things to do!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Good!  </p><h2 id="5-getting-along" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>5: Getting Along</h2><p><strong>Minato:</strong> Kagari, come sleep with me!<br><strong>Students:</strong> They're sleeping together!?<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> ...Minato-senpai, please refrain from saying things that others will misunderstand.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Misunderstand what? We're friends, aren't we? Remember, we went to that hot spring together.<br><strong>Students:</strong> Hot spring!!<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Along with Ema-senpai.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Whatever, just come take an afternoon nap with me! I found the perfect spot.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> I'm not going to.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> ...<br><strong>Minato:</strong> ...<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Minato-senpai, just how long do you plan on following me?<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Hey, I have something to take care of over this way too, okay?<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> ...<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> You also have some business in the training hall, Minato-senpai?<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Wait? You're going to the training hall, Kagari? Me too! I just felt like getting a little exercise, you know.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Then this is where we part ways.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Wait!? You just said, "you also have business", didn't you!?<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> You must have misheard me.　  
<strong>Kagari:</strong> I have work to do now, as Yukari-sama's attendant. I'll speak with you later.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Hey!<br><strong>Minato:</strong> ...Nng, she's so stubborn! But that just gets me more fired up!<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Yukari! I'm here to mess around!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> ...Minato, do you think this is a playground?<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Minato-senpai, now you're even bothering Yukari-sama...! What are you doing here!?<br><strong>Minato:</strong> I told you, messing around. You should join me, Yukari. You're gonna work yourself to death keeping this up.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> I wouldn't say I've been working myself that hard.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> That's enough! What are you thinking, dragging Yukari-sama into this!<br><strong>Minato:</strong> I just wanna get along with you, Kagari.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> ...!?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> ...So she says, Kagari. Why not go along with her?<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> But...<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Then, how about this! Kagari and I'll have a match, and the loser has to do whatever the winner says.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> ...That's ridiculous.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Don't be like that~!<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> ...Fine, I know you won't give up anyway. But if I win, I'm going to ask you not to follow me around anymore!<br><strong>Minato:</strong> If you win! Alright, you're on.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> ...Fufu, they get along so well.<br><strong>Minato Joins - Part 1:</strong> The Sea and Mountains in April<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Yeaaaay! It's the sea, it's the sea~! Even though it's still spring back in Kamakura, it feels like summer out here. Now if we could just find someone selling shaved ice, this'd be perfect~.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Minato-senpai, I'm sure you're aware, but we came here to suppress aradama. Not to sightsee.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Kagari is right. We need to eliminate the aradama first.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> I knowww...<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Don't sound so depressed; it'll affect our mission. Here, cheer up. If we finish quickly enough, we should have spare time for recreation.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Oh yeah! In that case, we just gotta take 'em out quick. Alright, aradama, bring it on, wherever you are!<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> The spectrum meter is reacting... They seem to be up in the mountains.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> We'll head there at once!<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> That's strange... The spectrum meter lost track.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Did they temporarily retreat somewhere? Until it picks up the signal again, we should find a safe spot to rest.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Hmm~, finding a safe spot's a good idea, but... Where are we, anyway? It looks like a dead end up ahead.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> We must be deep in the forest now. We should turn back the way we came.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Huh? That's weird. I swear we just passed by here...<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> It feels like we've been walking a great distance, but what if we've been walking in circles the whole time?<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Ehh!? Does that mean we're lost? When you're lost in the mountains, you're supposed to...<br><strong>Minato:</strong> If we walk along a stream, it should lead us to a more open area, right?<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> I see, a stream... I heard the faint sound of running water just a moment ago; there should be one nearby.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Wait. It sounds like a good idea in theory, but what if following the stream led us to a waterfall or rock face? We wouldn't be able to progress.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> If we carelessly follow the stream down, there's a possibility we could only waste our energy and put ourselves in a more precarious position.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> When you put it like that, you might be right.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> How are we meant to find our way down then...?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> If you have the stamina for it, ascending to the mountain's summit will increase your odds of finding a path back down.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Huh. You know, even though we're the same age, it feels like there's nothing you don't know, Yukari. I have a lotta respect for that.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> The polar opposite of Minato-senpai, who was about to irresponsibly send us down a stream...<br><strong>Minato:</strong> What'd you say!?<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> KIIIIIEE!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> So they showed themselves...<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> And there's a lot of them too. How to efficiently deal with them all...<br><strong>Minato:</strong> I've got a good idea for that! Come on, follow me!<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Minato-senpai? To where?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> ...I get it. Kagari, follow after Minato.<br><strong>Minato Joins - Part 2:</strong> Playing in the Water<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Minato-senpai, the aradama are chasing us; are we not going to fight them?<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Don't worry about them for now; just follow me!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> We reached the stream. Kagari, we're going to run along it for a little longer.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Eh? But what about the aradama?<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Keep following and wait and see~! Let's go!<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> KIEEEEE!<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> GUOOOO!<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Nice, the aradama all came after us. Okay, Yukari, Kagari, it's time to get to work!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Understood! We're beginning our attack. TAAAAAAAH-!<br><strong>Minato:</strong> DORYAAAAAAAA-!<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> (So the plan was to lure the aradama along the stream and wipe them out all at once... I should join in..)<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> HAAAAAAAAAH-!<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> Kiiiie...<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Awesome, that's all of them wiped out! My plan went perfectly~!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> That was some quick thinking, confining the aradama here with the stream. Well done, Minato.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> It was your advice before that made me come up with it. If we were really in an pinch, I thought we could drop down the waterfall.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> (The judgment to immediately apply information you had just heard as tactics in battle... It pains me to admit it, but Minato-senpai is good...)<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Now we can get back to the path... Oh yeah! We were lost, weren't we?<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Grr, and I thought we could play in the ocean after finishing the aradama this fast-!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Calm down, Minato. I told you before. At times like these, we only need to ascend the mountain.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Ehh, but we've been running around so much, and you want us to keep climbing? I'm too tired to move an inch-! I just wanna head down the mountain and fool around already-!<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> If you have the energy to spare fooling around, you can make your way up this mountain. Go on, follow Yukari-sama.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Fineee...<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Ahh~, finally, back at the beach-! I wasn't sure if we'd really find a way down after climbing to the top of the mountain, but Yukari was right like always~.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> And we even found the shortest path right to the beach... Minato-senpai's desire to fool around must have been strong enough for the heavens to answer.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> At any rate, we made it safely down the mountain, so feel free to use our remaining time here as you wish.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Yesss-! Last one in the water's a rotten egg!<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> In the water? It's still only April. And none of us brought bathing suits...<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Just go in like this? We're all covered in mud from fighting the aradama, so we can clean off while we're at it!<br><strong>Minato:</strong> See, come on in, Kagari. Take this!<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> That's cold-! Now you've done it, Minato-senpai. I'll show you...<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> It's cold...<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Yu... Yukari-sama! I'm terribly sorry! I only meant to splash Minato-senpai, but...<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Now that I'm this wet, you leave me no choice. I'll accept this challenge.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> That's the spirit, Yukari! This is how things ought to be! Kagari, Yukari, let's get this started-!<br><div><iframe width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nqyOMfDau7o"></iframe></div>  </p><h2 id="mahouka---minato-start-three-lost-people" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Mahouka - Minato: Start]: Three Lost People</h2><p><strong>Honoka:</strong> Heeeey!

You're lost, right?<br><strong>???:</strong> If it's alright, want me to help you look?<br><strong>Honoka:</strong> Are you sure? Umm, you're...?<br><strong>Shizuku:</strong> Who are you?<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Me?<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Actually, I'm lost too. I came here with two friends of mine, but somehow I got stuck on my own.<br><strong>Honoka:</strong> Oh, I see. Since you have an okatana, you must be a toji... Wait? Isn't that okatana...?<br><strong>Minato:</strong> What, Chidori?<br><strong>Shizuku:</strong> Someone we know has the same okatana.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Someone you know...?<br><strong>Minato:</strong> You sure you're not mixing it up? Chidori's my okatana.<br><strong>Honoka:</strong> Really? But, maybe there's another one of that okatana...<br><strong>Minato:</strong> There isn't one.<br><strong>Honoka:</strong> Huh?<br><strong>Shizuku:</strong> Honoka. We must just be just mistaken.<br><strong>Honoka:</strong> ...That's probably it, Shizuku.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> ...Hey, what's this girl like? The one you think has Chidori.<br><strong>Honoka:</strong> Umm... She's bright and cheery... Ah, she kind of feels a bit like you.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Hmm...<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Alright. In that case, like I said before, I'll help you look for them. I want to meet this girl too.<br><strong>Shizuku:</strong> You sure?<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Sure thing!<br><strong>Honoka:</strong> But, you're lost too, aren't you?<br><strong>Minato:</strong> I'll be fine. I figure I'll see my friends soon enough, and we might run into them when we're looking for your friends too.<br><strong>Honoka:</strong> I got it.
