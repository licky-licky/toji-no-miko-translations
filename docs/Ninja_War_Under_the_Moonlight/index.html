Something terrible has happened!!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Get a hold of yourself! As ninja in the service of Yukari-sama, we Origami ninja must always be calm and collected.<br>
<strong>Sakura:</strong> I-I&#x27;m... Very sorry...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Now then, what happened?<br>
<strong>Sakura:</strong> That&#x27;s, ninja from another territory seem to have infiltrated our ninja mansion. Their target is likely...<br>
<strong>Sakura:</strong> That &quot;secret letter&quot;, I believe.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> What are the guards doing, allowing the enemy to slip through? If they&#x27;re that negligent, I&#x27;ll have to re-discipline them later.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> However, Makizou-dono, we do have a bit of spare time. A round of rat hunting might be amusing.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> A rat hunt...? You may be on to something, Suzusuke-dono.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> If they&#x27;re skilled enough to invade here, they may prove useful in killing time... We&#x27;ll see.  </p><p>Meanwhile, on the other side--</p><p><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Damnit, why do I have to play along with this dumb stuff? What moron came up with &quot;Mokusa ninja&quot;!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> P-Please calm down, Kofukimaru-san. If you make too much noise, the enemy will find us.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> And who do you think you&#x27;re calling Kofukimaru?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Please calm down, that&#x27;s just how it is. We&#x27;ve come this far, so please give up and accept it.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> I&#x27;m no good at giving up!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Anyway, you&#x27;re acting pretty weird. Can&#x27;t believe you actually volunteered for this stupid job.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ehh~, it seemed like a lot of fun.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> No good... You and I are on totally different channels. I&#x27;m not into this kind of game.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> And since I&#x27;m not into it, can I drop the act and just call it quits here?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You can&#x27;t do that. We&#x27;re not allowed to go back until the mission is over, Shichinosato-san. Ahh, I didn&#x27;t mean that! ...Kofukimaru-san!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Ugh, well whatever... Let&#x27;s get this bad joke over with already. So, what&#x27;s this thing we&#x27;re after again?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Within this mansion, there lies a certain secret message. We need to steal it and escape the village.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Right, great... So what the hell is &quot;a certain secret message&quot;? What &quot;village&quot;?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> The secret message is a secret message. The village is a village. Please don&#x27;t try to poke holes in the setting.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Poke holes!? Between the secret message and the village, there&#x27;s more holes than setting!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> I guess it doesn&#x27;t matter... I just have to play along. Let&#x27;s hurry and get this over with!  </p><p>Once again, on the other side--</p><p><strong>Maki:</strong> There you are! Skulking around in a place like this; you truly are rats!<br>
<strong>Nagasaki Sumi:</strong> Ahh, we&#x27;re not rats, we&#x27;re ninja...<br>
<strong>Maruyama Akane:</strong> That&#x27;s right! We&#x27;re ninja, so of course we&#x27;re gonna hide!<br>
<strong>Akane:</strong> A ninja without the nin is just a ja! [ninja is made up the kanji nin, to hide, and ja, person]<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Still, to be discovered so quickly... We can&#x27;t take the Origami ninja lightly.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> In the first place, you&#x27;re all disorganized.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> What a shame... At this rate, our fun will be over all too soon.<br>
<strong>Akane:</strong> Hey-! We Mokusa ninja&#x27;ve been training our bodies hard! You&#x27;ll regret looking down on us!<br>
<strong>Sumi:</strong> Ah... We were trying to stay undercover... Why did you say who we are...?<br>
<strong>Akane:</strong> Ah- No wayyy! You tricked me! That&#x27;s playing dirty!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I don&#x27;t believe it; you actually revealed your own identity... Even disorganized was giving you too much credit. Please try not to disappoint us any further.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> We have no obligation to meet your expectations, but we can&#x27;t continue like we planned. Everyone, get ready!<br>
<strong>Sumi:</strong> Right!<br>
<strong>Akane:</strong> I&#x27;ll follow your lead!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...Well, self-proclaimed Mokusa ninja, could you please entertain us for a while?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> You came all this way to face defeat!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="2-the-difference-in-daily-training-shown-through-defeat"></a>2: The Difference in Daily Training Shown Through Defeat<a class="hash-link" href="#2-the-difference-in-daily-training-shown-through-defeat" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Akane:</strong> Ninja Art: Deadlift Technique!!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I can see right through it!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> HNPH-!!<br>
<strong>Akane:</strong> Gahhh! So... Heavy... How can one strike be that heavy!?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Oh...? You were able to block that? Though if you don&#x27;t put your hips into it, you&#x27;ll be split in two.<br>
<strong>Akane:</strong> Easy for you to say, but I&#x27;m overworked here...!<br>
<strong>Akane:</strong> For me to get overpowered like this... No way... You&#x27;re so tough... What routine did you do to get like this?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I&#x27;ll tell you... First, a light run of about 40km. Follow that with fingertip push ups, sit ups, lat pulldowns, squat hops, lateral crossovers, and pull ups. That&#x27;s 500 repetitions of each.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Then 200 curls with a 40kg weight in each hand. Next, with an axe, I chop 1,000 pieces of firewood, followed by 2,000 practice swings with my sword.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Now a run up a flight of 200 stone steps, 20 times. Then a 20km swim against the waves. Finally, two sparring sessions to finish it off.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Take a good cleansing bath to relax your muscles, and eat a lot of nutritious food. That&#x27;s all.<br>
<strong>Akane:</strong> That&#x27;s all...! Your routine&#x27;s insane...!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> If she&#x27;s off duty that day, she&#x27;ll do it all twice...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Or at least, that&#x27;s the character she&#x27;s playing.<br>
<strong>Akane:</strong> Character!? I thought you were serious, you got me~!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Don&#x27;t break character, Suzuka. You ruined such a perfect mood!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> It could cause trouble if she actually believed you. Not to mention, I didn&#x27;t think you&#x27;d get so carried away...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Anyway, with the rigorous training I go through every day, my strength has no equal!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> And here&#x27;s proof! Origami Ninja Art: Great Tornado Whirlwind Cutter!!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> This... Sword pressure... Kyaaaaa!!<br>
<strong>Akane:</strong> Gyaaaah~ I&#x27;m beaaaaat~... Thud...!!<br>
<strong>Sumi:</strong> Th-Thud...!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> In the end, you were no match for us Origami ninja. You need to show more dedication to your training.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Sakurayoshi, please escort the captured Yanase Mai, Maruyama Akane, and Nagasaki Sumi to the dungeon.<br>
<strong>Sakura:</strong> U-Understood!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ...Still, it doesn&#x27;t add up.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> What doesn&#x27;t?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Did Mokusa&#x27;s leader really believe ninja of that caliber could steal the secret letter from our mansion?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Perhaps... They lack the manpower for it?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Perhaps. But it&#x27;s too soon to grow complacent.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Us undermining their plan could have been another part of their plan. Thinking along those lines--<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I see... These girls were a diversion. Their main force is sneaking in elsewhere.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> It&#x27;s a reasonable assumption.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Then, let us hunt down this main force. Maybe they can prove more entertaining.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="3-thats-a-promise"></a>3: That&#x27;s a Promise<a class="hash-link" href="#3-thats-a-promise" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I see why they call this the impregnable ninja mansion of the Origami ninja. We&#x27;ll have to move cautiously through here.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Of course there&#x27;s hidden pitfalls... But then there&#x27;s this kind of trap and that kind of trap. Not to mention, I didn&#x27;t even think they could prepare a trap like that one! Very impressive.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> This kind of trap and that kind of trap? What kind of trap?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Y-You know... An amazing trap that would make you shout &quot;AHH!&quot; if you sprung it...<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> I hate to rain on your parade, but there&#x27;s no traps anywhere in here, you know?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Well~, what about a falling ceiling or a flooding room... It&#x27;s more fun to pretend those kind of traps are there!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...You&#x27;re surprisingly into this stuff, huh, Kiyoka. Well, at least someone&#x27;s having fun with it.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Are you not having fun, Kofukimaru-san?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Do I look like I&#x27;m having fun? I keep telling you, let&#x27;s just get this over with so we can go home already.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> For that, we need to locate their secret letter...<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Yeah, I know. The problem is where are they keeping this secret whatever?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> According to the setting, the secret letter is extremely important, so they must be keeping it in the most secure part of the mansion.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Looking at the structure of the building... Ah, I mean, considering the circumstances, I believe it&#x27;s in the innermost room of the mansion.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Considering the circumstances, the innermost room, huh. You sure about that?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> In cases like this, that&#x27;s a promise.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Promise, huh... So you&#x27;ve really got no idea.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Let&#x27;s head deeper in at least. The secret letter is sure to be there, I know it... Considering the circumstances.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Considering the circumstances, huh... But before that, we&#x27;ve got guests.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Guests?<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> KIKIKIGIGIGIGIGIGI...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Aradama!? No way, why!?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Who cares why? They showed up at the best possible time!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> I was about to die from boredom! I love you! My aradama-chan!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Mmmm~ I feel great! Aradama-chan&#x27;s the best after all!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Using aradama is going too far! I never heard anything about this.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Do the defenders want to win that badly? In that case, this should count as a foul... Actually, it should be an out.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Since it&#x27;s come to this, we can&#x27;t afford to lose either. We have to defeat the evil deputies, and bring peace back to the land!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> No, there&#x27;s no evil deputies! And the game&#x27;s rules didn&#x27;t say anything about peace; we&#x27;ve just gotta bring back the secret letter.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> .........! Ah, that&#x27;s right!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Don&#x27;t give me that. Just how carried away with this game are you gonna get? And anyway, about those aradama.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> They didn&#x27;t come from the other team. They must have just showed up on their own.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> They did!?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> No matter how bad they want to win, nobody&#x27;s gonna use aradama for this dumbass make believe exercise!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> .........They wouldn&#x27;t, right?  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="4-after-a-furious-finish-farewell-ninja-mansion"></a>4: After a Furious Finish, Farewell, Ninja Mansion<a class="hash-link" href="#4-after-a-furious-finish-farewell-ninja-mansion" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...Kofukimaru-san. It seems we&#x27;ve reached the mansion&#x27;s innermost room. That secret letter is sure to be here...<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> It was surprisingly easy finding this place.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Fufufufufu... Of course it was.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> After all, we wanted to guide you here.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> The Origami ninja, they found us!?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Suspecting nothing, you happily wandered right into our ambush.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> There&#x27;s nowhere left to run or hide. At last you realize, you&#x27;re nothing but trapped rats.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Trapped rats, or wolves in sheep&#x27;s clothing? Doesn&#x27;t matter. Either way, we&#x27;re gonna lay you flat here.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Oh? At least your tongue is sharp, if nothing else.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> You&#x27;ll find out how sharp the rest is, once we beat you.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> You&#x27;re not too bad at this.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> More importantly... Where&#x27;s the secret letter?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> If that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re after, Sakurayoshi is guarding it there.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That&#x27;s...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I&#x27;ll handle our foes. Sakurayoshi, in the meantime, keep the secret letter safe!<br>
<strong>Sakura:</strong> U-U-U-U-Understood! Ahh- Kyaah!!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> What are you doing, Sakurayoshi! Hurry and escape with the secret letter!<br>
<strong>Sakura:</strong> Ah, owwwww... I fell over, I think I cracked my butt...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> It was cracked from the beginning! Hurry! Escape! Protect the secret letter!<br>
<strong>Sakura:</strong> I&#x27;m sorry... B-But it hurts... Ughh, I can&#x27;t stand up...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Absolutely pathetic... You call yourself an Origami ninja!?<br>
<strong>Sakura:</strong> Ah... I&#x27;m sorry...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Makizou-dono, don&#x27;t be so hard on her. Not everyone who gathered here is a toji like us. She&#x27;s only a researcher from the medical department.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ...Have you forgotten, Suzusuke? Right now, we&#x27;re all ninja! Nothing more, nothing less.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> &quot;Toji&quot;, &quot;researchers&quot;, words like those which break this world have no place here!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I understand that, but... I didn&#x27;t think you&#x27;d be so obsessive about it. In a way, I&#x27;m impressed!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You let your guard down! I&#x27;ll be taking the secret letter now!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Damn! Run, Sakurayoshi!!<br>
<strong>Sakura:</strong> Ahhh~~!! My butt! My butt still hurts...!<br>
<strong>Announcer:</strong> Time is up. Time is up. The invading team could not complete their objective within the time limit. Therefore, the defending team wins.<br>
<strong>Announcer:</strong> I repeat: Time is up. Time is up. The invading team could not complete their objective within the time limit. Therefore, the defending team wins.<br>
<strong>Announcer:</strong> Good work out there, everyone. With this, the special training course &quot;Ninja Mansion&quot; is concluded.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Phew~ We were in a pinch, but it&#x27;s our victory.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> That was a close one, to be sure.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ahhh~, we lost...<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> I couldn&#x27;t care less about this training, but losing&#x27;s still frustrating.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You say that, but I think you were enjoying it by the end, Shichinosato-san.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Tch, I wasn&#x27;t really enjoying it.<br>
<strong>Sakura:</strong> W-Well I enjoyed it! Usually I&#x27;m too busy with research to get out much, so... I had fun!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Don&#x27;t be mistaken, this wasn&#x27;t a game. It&#x27;s still practice. A part of our training.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> There&#x27;s nothing wrong with enjoying your training though, isn&#x27;t that right, &quot;Makizou-dono&quot;?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Aghh~ If only we&#x27;d had a few more seconds!<br>
<strong>Sumi:</strong> I&#x27;m jealous you all got to participate till the end...<br>
<strong>Akane:</strong> I know, they just scooped us up and locked us away! I thought we&#x27;d get to do more!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Let&#x27;s learn from our mistakes next time.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> We aren&#x27;t about to lose next time either.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Next time...? You can&#x27;t be serious. If you&#x27;re gonna do it, have fun without me.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> What are you saying, Shichinosato Kofuki? You don&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re quitting here, do you?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Huhh? You&#x27;re the one talking crazy. Of course I&#x27;m not sticking around!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Oh my. It seems that no one explained in detail to you.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> About what?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> The foundation of this project is role-playing. Along with the victory condition, it&#x27;s important that you&#x27;re able to adapt to your role.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> This program serves as training for your ability to carry out whatever role you&#x27;re given.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> It goes without saying that a team of toji working together need to trust each other to cooperate. Acting according to your private interests is forbidden.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> And in your case, Shichinosato-san. With your complete lack of cooperation, we were asked by Kitora Mirja-san to train you thoroughly.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll get to leave until after we finish all seven more sets.<br>
