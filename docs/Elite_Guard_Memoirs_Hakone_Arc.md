## 1: Let's Go to the Hot Springs
**Yume:** Ahhh, I'm so bored-. Hey, can't we all go to some hot springs together?  
**Suzuka:** That sounds nice, hot springs. We've been working nonstop lately, so a chance to let our hair down would be much appreciated.  
**Maki:** There's no way all four of us can take a trip at once. Who's going to guard Yukari-sama then?  
**Suzuka:** I know that. It's only wishful thinking. You take everything so seriously, Maki-san.  
**Maki:** Oh, you weren't serious? ...Still, it would be good if we could visit hot springs together.  
**Yume:** What if we say it's for an elite guard training camp? Then Yukari-sama will take us and we can all go to the hot springs! Like in Hakone!  
**Yomi:** That's an unrealistic plan.  
**Yume:** ...Wait? Didn't all four of us go to a hot spring in Hakone before?  
**Suzuka:** We did. If I remember right, it was around when the elite guard was still being formed, shortly after Yume joined.  
**Maki:** Back then we were elite guard in name only. We weren't used to each other yet, so it was disgraceful the way we struggled with each other.  
**Maki:** Especially on that day. Just thinking about it makes my cheeks burn red.  
**Suzuka:** Though it's thanks to that incident that we began mutually respecting each other's ability--  

## 2: In the Past: Aradama Eradication Operation
**Yukari:** --Maki, Suzuka. This time, I'll have you two aid in an operation to eliminate aradama located in Hakone.  
**Yukari:** The scale of this operation will be greater than anything you two have been assigned since the formation of the elite guard.  
**Yukari:** To that end, I've arranged for many toji to be under your command. All the equipment and rations you should need have been prepared as well.  
**Maki:** Thank you for trusting me with such an important mission.  
**Suzuka:** I'll see to it that this operation is carried out without fail.  
**Suzuka:** --So then, Maki-san. Were you planning on leading the charge again?  
**Maki:** Of course. Having the captain at the front allows you to react and give orders as fast as possible.  
**Suzuka:** Is that so. However, it's my opinion that a captain should stay behind the unit, to get the clearest picture looking after the whole group.  
**Maki:** But my unit suffers less injuries compared to others. The numbers don't lie.  
**Suzuka:** That they don't. Then this time, I suppose I'll have to stick close to you and study how you fight.  
**Suzuka:** I might even learn the secret behind your strength for myself, Maki-san.  
**Maki:** Do whatever you want. Let's go, there's aradama to cut down! --Haah!  
**Suzuka:** As I've come to expect, you handle your sword well, Maki-san.  
**Suzuka:** ---! There's one coming around behind you! I'll dispose of it! Haaaah!!  
**Maki:** -!? Suzuka, you're too close!! Give me more room to fight!!  
**Maki:** I almost hit you when I swung at that aradama!  
**Suzuka:** What's with your attitude!? I moved in to save you, you know!  
**Maki:** I didn't need your help! Worry about yourself instead of me!  
**Suzuka:** ...!! Is that so!! Then the next time you're in a pinch, Maki-san, I'll look the other way!!  
**Maki:** Good! That works for me!  
**Suzuka:** Honestly, what is with you...! ...Forget it. I'll return to the rear of the unit, like usual--  
**Suzuka:** ...Eh-!?  

## 3: Army of Aradama
**Suzuka:** We've been completely surrounded by aradama! Just where did they all come from...!?  
**Suzuka:** They can't have been lying in wait for us, can they...?  
**Maki:** It's just a coincidence. Aradama setting up an ambush is unheard of.  
**Suzuka:** ...You're right, I'm overthinking it. Aradama don't have the intelligence for it, after all.  
**Maki:** Still, this is bad. We've been separated from the rest of the group.  
**Maki:** We need to hurry and regroup--  
**Suzuka:** Still, against these numbers, reuniting with them won't be easy.  
**Maki:** We need to come up with a plan. But with their attacks coming one after another, it's hard getting a grip on the situation--  

Approximately six hours after Maki and Suzuka were separated from the rest of the unit.
  
**Commander A:** What's going on out there!? The amount of aradama hasn't decreased in the slightest!  
**Commander B:** Are Shidou-san and Konohana-san still unaccounted for!?  
**Commander C:** I don't care how big the operation was supposed to be, how can you lose track of two of our top toji like that...!!  
**Commander D:** This shouldn't be possible...!! There's no record of anything like this happening...!!  
**Commander E:** The toji on site are asking for instructions! Can anyone deal with them--  
**Commander B:** What do you want us to say!? Tell them to act at their own discretion!  
**Watanuki Kazumi:** --I've heard that Maki-sama and Suzuka-sama were separated from their unit, but how did this happen!?  
**Commander F:** Those two were fighting in the vanguard, when a sudden swarm of aradama overwhelmed them.  
**Commander F:** Their current whereabouts are unknown. The numbers of aradama in the area are too great to conduct a search.  
**Naeba Wakako:** For both captains to have been isolated by a swarm of aradama, isn't this a complete disaster...!?  
**Kazumi:** It's been six hours already since they began fighting. We need to re-establish contact immediately to get them out of this war of attrition.  
**Kazumi:** Have the toji on site form a rescue party, and search from where those two--  
**Commander F:** On top of the immense numbers of aradama in the area, none of the other toji have experience commanding a unit. They have their hands full just keeping themselves safe.  
**Commander F:** Given their circumstances, they don't have the toji to spare separating into a rescue party.  
**Kazumi:** You can't be serious... Then you plan on leaving Maki-sama out there to die...!?  
**Commander F:** I-I didn't say that... It's just, we have no other options to work with.  
**Wakako:** So you're praying for a miracle that the aradama are dealt with before it's too late...?  
**???:** Don't waste your breath on prayer. Miracles are something we must make for ourselves.  
**Wakako:** -!? Y-Yukari-sama-!!  

## 4: At the End of a Fight for Your Life
**Maki:** Pant... Pant... Shit... No matter how many we cut down... There's more...  
**Suzuka:** My arms and legs are like lead... Can hardly find the strength... To grip my okatana...  
**Maki:** Phone's out of battery... Pant... Pant... Out of water... Out of food...  
**Suzuka:** If this goes on much longer... We'll...  
**Suzuka:** Since it's come to this... We may as well... Take as many with us...  
**Suzuka:** Make things easier on... The other toji...!  
**Maki:** Suzuka... What are you thinking...?  
**Suzuka:** ...The same as you, I'd imagine...!  
**Maki:** Got it... Suzuka, there's something I have to say.  
**Maki:** When you saved me back then... I shouldn't have been so harsh with you. Sorry.  
**Suzuka:** -!? ...No, I was acting childish as well...  
**Suzuka:** ...Alright. Gather what strength you have left. This is our last dance!  
**Maki:** Good...... Then, let's make this count!! URAAAAAAAHHH-!!  
**Suzuka:** YAAAAAAAHHH-!!  
**Yume:** YOU TWO! I'M HERE TO SAVE YOU!  
**Suzuka:** ...Ehh? (Am I hallucinating from the fatigue...!?)  
**Yomi:** Sorry we kept you waiting. You're safe now. There's a team of guards close behind us.  
**Yume:** The hero always shows up at the last minute, you know! They're not always a girl though!  
**Maki:** ...Yomi and Yume!? What're you doing here...!?  
**Yomi:** We came to rescue you two, on Yukari-sama's orders.  
**Yume:** That's how it is! --Still, you two got beat up pretty bad, huh!  
**Yume:** You've got a long way to go if all it took was some aradama for you to end up like this, Onee-san~.  
**Maki:** Sh... Shut up...! Did you come here to save us or humiliate us; make up your mind...!  
**Yume:** Ahaha! Seems like you're feeling better already if you can talk back like that!  
**Yume:** Anyway, just leave the rest to me!  

## 5: Origami Yukari's Might
Several hours before Yomi and Yume met up with Maki and Suzuka.

**Commader A:** The aradama are gathering their numbers! Find some way to keep them in check!  
**Commander B:** How long before the situation returns to normal!? I need enough time for a bathroom break!  
**Commander C:** Quit complaining; you're bringing down morale! You're not the only one having a rough time here, you know!  
**Commander D:** That's right! The toji on the scene are really suffering out there!  
**Yukari:** Everyone in Operations Headquarters, may I have your attention?  
**Commander B:** -!? Y-Yukari-sama...!? Why is Yukari-sama here...!!  
**Commander A:** Silence, everyone! Yukari-sama's speaking!  
**Yukari:** --In regards to Maki and Suzuka, I've already formed a rescue party. I will be taking command from here.  
**Commander C:** Yukari-sama formed a rescue team...!? More importantly, she's taking control of Operations HQ herself...!!  
**Yukari:** Is there a seat for me to borrow?  
**Commander C:** T-Take mine...!!  
**Commander D:** Just being in the same room with Yukari-sama; what an honor...!!  
**Commander A:** To all of you in the field! Yukari-sama has arrived here at Operations Headquarters! Just hold on a little longer! Hang in there!  
**Yukari:** ...Hmm.  
**Kazumi:** ...Excuse me, Yukari-sama. Thank you, for forming a rescue party.  
**Yukari:** Maki and Suzuka are both very valuable. I wouldn't allow them to be lost here.  
**Yukari:** --Yomi, Yume. Continue forward, suppressing all aradama in your way. Rescue Maki and Suzuka.  
**Yomi:** --Yes. Please count on us.  
**Yume:** This'll be a piece of cake for me~. By the way, Yukari-sama, after this is over, I want a match with you as my reward-!  

## 6: Searching for Their Comrades
--Several hours before Yomi and Yume met up with Maki and Suzuka.

**Yume:** Ahahahaha-! Keep it coming, aradama-! Take this-!  
**Yume:** --Mmm-? This one's pretty tough! Still no match for me though!  
**Yomi:** --Kh! As the reports mentioned, there's an incredible number of aradama here...!  
**Yume:** Wah-!? That one snuck up behind me! You pervy aradama!  
**Yume:** Hey, stop-! You're not getting away!  
**Yomi:** Please wait, Tsubakuro-san. We aren't headed in that direction...  
**Yukari:** Yume, don't act on your own. Stay by Yomi's side.  
**Yume:** Ahaha, sorry 'bout that-!  
**Yomi:** Tsubakuro-san. Thank you for coming back.  
**Yume:** You're welcome! By the way, where're we going anyway?  
**Yomi:** You were fighting without knowing that...? Shidou-san and Konohana-san are approximately three kilometers away, bearing 12 o'clock.  
**Yume:** ...Ahh! Is that cause of your special searching ability? You can use that to find allies too, huh!  
**Yume:** Since we know where we're going, I won't get lost! So let's push on ahead!  
**Yomi:** No, we need to maintain this pace with the rest of the unit--  
**Yume:** The sun'll set if we go as slow as them! Do you want those two to die before we get there!  
**Yomi:** ...Understood. Then, please clear a path for the others to follow, Tsubakuro-san.  
**Yume:** Roger that~! Then, just follow me-! Take that-! Ahahaha! I keep cutting and cutting and there's still more of them!  
**Yomi:** Haaah! I won't allow you to interfere with our mission!  
**Yume:** By the way, you're pretty good for being able to keep up with me, Onee-san.  
**Yume:** What was your first name again, anyway?  
**Yomi:** ...I introduced myself earlier, but it seems you forgot...  
**Yomi:** It's Yomi. My name is Satsuki Yomi.  
**Kazumi:** Despite the number of aradama, they're progressing so quickly...!! The elite guard are on another level...!!  
**Wakako:** At this rate, they'll find Suzuka-sama before sunset, won't they!!  
**Yukari:** ......Yomi, Yume. Stay on guard as you advance.  

## 7: Escape from the Brink of Death
**Yume:** --So we kept on going like Yukari-sama told us to, and then we found you two!  
**Yomi:** Yukari-sama's directions were always on the mark.  
**Maki:** ...Is that, so...  
**Suzuka:** All of you... Thank you... Very much...  
**Yume:** Hmmm? Are you two feeling pretty tired?  
**Yomi:** They were fighting for nearly half a day. I think this goes beyond being tired.  
**Maki:** That's... Right. For a while now, my arms and legs have gone numb.  
**Suzuka:** I suppose this is what they mean by "on your last legs".  
**Yume:** Really! Then you should just rest here and watch as I finish off the aradama!  
**Yume:** Ahahahaha! Take this-!!  
**Yomi:** ...Tsubakuro-san. Our mission was to rescue those two. There's no need to fight these aradama.  
**Yume:** But I want to have some more fun! Don't be such a spoilsport, Yomi onee-san!  
**Yomi:** ...Understood. It could make extraction difficult if we were attacked from the rear, so let's first eliminate all the aradama in the area.  
**Yume:** Yaay! That's more like it! Get ready, cause here I come-!  
**Yomi:** I simply destroy. --Haah!  
**Maki:** ...They're impressive, Yomi and Yume.  
**Suzuka:** Yes... They saved us...  
**Maki:** ......  
**Suzuka:** ......  
**Maki:** ...Haha.  
**Suzuka:** ...Fufufu.  

## 8: Everyone in the Hot Springs!
**Suzuka:** Ahh... The water's nice... I feel like I've passed on to heaven...  
**Maki:** The hot springs after crossing the verge of death are something else...  
**Maki:** I really thought it was the end for us when we were surrounded by those aradama.  
**Suzuka:** I doubt we'd still be around if Yomi and Yume hadn't arrived when they did.  
**Suzuka:** I have to thank you all; without you I'd never be able to relax in the hot springs like this.  
**Yume:** Hmph...! Hmmmph~!!  
**Suzuka:** ...Yume?　What are you groaning about?  
**Yume:** Your boobs are all too big, Onee-sans!  
**Suzuka:** -!? Wh-Where did that come from!?  
**Yume:** Suzuka onee-san and Yomi onee-san both are like grown up ladies!  
**Yume:** But even Maki onee-san, who acts like a boy, is way bigger than I thought... I wanna get that big too already...  
**Maki:** Hahaha... You know, even when you grow up, they might stay small.  
**Yume:** That's not gonna happen! I'm gonna keep on growing!  
**Yomi:** ...If they stay small, you could try surgery.  
**Suzuka:** Don't give her such terrible advice, Yomi!  
**Yomi:** ...By the way, you two are tired, aren't you? I can wash your backs for you.  
**Suzuka:** Will you? To tell the truth, my arms are at their limit after all that fighting. It would be a great help...  
**Yomi:** Leave it to me.  
**Yume:** Then I'll wash Maki onee-san's back!  
**Maki:** Thanks, if you could. ...You're the only ones I'd trust my back to.  
**Suzuka:** Fufu... Maki-san, that phrase is a bit of an exaggeration in this situation, don't you think?  
**Maki:** Pff, you're right about that. Hahahaha!
