It's hard to get across, so I went with whatever works.]</h2><p><strong>Chie:</strong> I'm sorry to call you out here so suddenly, Ellen-san, Yui-chan.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Don't worry about a thing! For you, Chie-san, I'd come running through hell or high water!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> That's right, Chie.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> I'm glad to hear that then.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> It doesn't sound like you called us here to play around. Is this a mission?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> That's right. Someone needs to suppress aradama that have infested a hot spring.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Oh! A hot spring?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Count me in-!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> First we can wash off the tiredness from getting there, then we can wash off the tiredness from getting rid of the aradama!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> About that, from the sound of things, the aradama have taken up in the source of the springwater.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Because of that, they can no longer maintain the spring, so no one is allowed in.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Oh no!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> No one can enter the springs...? That's big trouble!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> It seems like it. This month is the busy season for the inn, so the aradama are stopping their business.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> ...I won't forgive them.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> A hot springs inn without a hot spring is just an inn!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> We have to stop these aradama as soon as possible!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> It's a bit of a long trip, so why don't we meet back up after getting our things together? Would that be alright?<br><strong>Ellen/Yui:</strong> Sure-!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Let's see... Mm, that should be everything. I'm all set.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> "I'm finished here. How are things with you two?" Sent.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> ...Ah, they already replied. Hmm, oh, it seems like they'll take a little longer.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> That leaves me with some free time, but... What to do?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> I ended up coming to the meeting spot early. Well... It's better than showing up late.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Huh, Chii-nee? What're you doing with that suitcase?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Are you going on a trip?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Just a bit of a long distance mission that came up.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> It could end up taking the rest of the week, so I needed a few changes of clothes.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ehh!? So you won't be here this weekend!? That's too bad...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I wanted to go on a sweets tour with you... But I guess we can't now?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Nnn... When you use those puppy dog eyes of yours, Mihono-chan...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> But... I'm sorry. No matter how much I hurry, I probably won't be back before the weekend is over...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Really... Okay! Since it's a mission, I know you can't help it!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Who are you going with?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> That'd be me!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> And me too!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yui and Ellen-san! Huh, I wouldn't expected you guys to get grouped together.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Think again, Mihono-chan! You see, Ellen-san and Chie-san both have an overwhelming motherly nature in common!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Mmm, I don't think I'm much of the motherly type. I'm an onee-san after all...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> No no, look, you two have such huge motherly attributes right there!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I see, our breasts, huh. I think you'd get along with Nene, Yuiyui.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> I've heard the rumors too. I'd like to have a nice long chat with Nene someday!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Looks like a fun team though, Chii-nee.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Fufu, I agree.  </p><h2 id="2-neither-doctors-nor-springwater-can-cure-lovesickness" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>2: Neither Doctors nor Springwater (Can Cure Lovesickness)</h2><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> Hmm, what do I do now...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Good morning, Hono-chan.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah, morning, Kiyoka.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I heard you groaning back there. Did you forget to do your homework?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Nah, I finished all of it this time. But that's not it, Chii-nee left on a long assignment yesterday.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Oh, I heard about that from Yui-chan.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> She said "There's a big aradama infestation, so it could take until the start of next week! Sorry, I won't be able to play with you this weekend!"  
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Did you have plans to do something with Yui?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> No, we didn't talk about anything.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ahaha, that's Yui alright.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Actually, I was thinking of going somewhere with Chii-nee this weekend!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Oh, so that's why you looked so disappointed.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah. What were you going to do this weekend, Kiyoka?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Have you made any plans yet?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I was planning on visiting a hot spring with a senpai from my school.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> We started talking about it a long time ago.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> A hot spring!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Sounds nice. Do I know that senpai of yours? If it's okay with you two, I'd want to tag along!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Mmhm, you know them. It's Juujou-san.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> If you want to go with us... It doesn't hurt to ask, so why don't we go talk to her together at lunchtime?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Okay!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Juujou-saaan!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Kiyoka? I was looking for you. There's something I wanted to ask...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Hey, it's Kaoru-san.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> I'm guessing you two wanted to talk about the same thing. You want to go to the hot spring too?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yep, that's right! Are you going too?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Ellen was busy and I had nothing else to do, and that's when I heard about this trip.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Hey, we're totally in the same boat! Hot springs are the best, aren't they?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> You get to soak in the water, and eat great food, and play table tennis.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Table tennis... I'm pretty good at that, you know?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I'm not about to lose either!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...Umm, the hot spring we were planning on visiting doesn't actually have table tennis there.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ehh!? There's no table tennis...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> But I still feel like competing, so why don't we play it now?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Pass. Listen up, Mihono. Table tennis is always fun when there's a hot spring to get in nearby.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> But if we do it here, we'd only be working up a sweat.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Isn't working up a sweat a good thing?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> It's just tiring. Without a hot spring to cure that tiredness, table tennis loses half its appeal.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Isn't that a different appeal though? But if they don't have table tennis, we can always think up some other kind of exercise.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> A bigger workout gets another pass. Table tennis is just barely at the acceptable level of exercise. Ideally, it should be something we can do in our room.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Then... How about a pillow fight?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I think we'd need a few more people than just the four of us for a good pillow fight.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> We can think about what we'll do later. For starters, we need to tell the inn we're bringing more people.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Please do... Ah, what about ghost stories?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Ghost stories? I've never done that before, but is telling scary stories really that interesting?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It's interesting because it's scary! And aside from ghost stories, we can talk about love too!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Talk about love...!?  
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> That's about as standard as it gets, but... Does any of us even have a partner?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Just putting this out there, but I don't.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> A-As if I have someone like that!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I don't think I do either. Besides, what's more important now is our duty as toji!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> That's right, well said, Mihono!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I don't either... So I guess we should tell scary stories after all.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ughh... So that's how it'll be. I'm not great with scary stories...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Fufufu, get yourself ready, Hono-chan. I'll have a lot of scary stories in store for everyone!  </p><h2 id="3-a-waste-of-ones-efforts" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>3: A Waste of One's Efforts</h2><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> We can't go in the spring?<br><strong>Landlady:</strong> I'm very sorry. Because aradama appeared in the source of the springwater, we can't maintain it anymore...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> But we came all this way... What should we do?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> There's nothing to think about. We should just exterminate those aradama.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I agree with Juujou-san!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> And after we beat the aradama, we can get in the hot spring. It's two birds with one stone.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...You're right. We came this far, so we can't leave without getting in the water!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> You all look like you made your minds up.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Are you against this, Kaoru?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> It seems like a lot of work.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...That's how I feel, but somebody's got to do this. I'll go along with you guys.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> I've never seen you put up that little resistance before.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> It'd be way more annoying coming out here and not even getting in a hot spring, after all.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Seems like a lot of work though.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Then that's settled. Where is the spring's source?<br><strong>Landlady:</strong> It's up that mountain...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Ah, that way? Good, we can leave now.<br><strong>Mihono/Kiyoka:</strong> Yeah!<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Ne-!<br><strong>Landlady:</strong> P-Please wait. It's dangerous if you leave right now. The sun will be setting soon, and the forecast said the snowfall tonight will be terrible.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Snow up on a mountain at night...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I'm worried that we won't be able to stop the aradama.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> It can be dangerous up on a snowy mountain if you're not used to it. What do you want to do?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Let's see...<br><strong>Landlady:</strong> U-Um, three toji had already set out to suppress the aradama before you arrived...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> What?<br><strong>Landlady:</strong> I'm sorry, I should have told you right away.<br><strong>Landlady:</strong> They took care of the aradama in town yesterday, and today they went to the spring's source...<br><strong>Karou:</strong> If there's already toji dealing with it, why don't we just wait here and see how things go tonight?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> They might even be suppressing the aradama right now.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> I can't deny that, but... What do you two think?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I think we should do what Kaoru-san says and wait here tonight.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Fighting in the dark and snow... It sounds sort of scary...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> If I had to say, I think I'm with Kiyoka on this.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> It's three against one, Hiyori.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> I-I never said I was against waiting here!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> We'll stay here at the inn tonight! Got that!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> This is something that actually happened to my mother... It was in... That's right, it was an inn just like this one.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Gulp.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> My mother went on a trip with some friends to a hot spring. They got in the spring, ate a good meal, and relaxed... Before they knew it, it was 10 at night.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Hey, that's almost just like us here.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> D-Don't make unnecessary comments in the middle of the story!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> You getting scared-?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> N-N-N-Nobody's scared! Kiyoka! Just keep going!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> "The water was so nice, wasn't it?" "Want to go get back in?" As they chatted like that into the night, they heard a voice from the other side of the sliding door.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> "Would any of you guests like a massage?"<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> That's sexual harassment.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> No, apparently it was a woman's voice. My mother refused, and they didn't hear from the voice again.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> But... It was strange.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Wh-What was?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> They heard the voice from the other side of the sliding door, right? But on the other side of that... There should have been a locked door.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Eek...!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> My mother and her friends quickly realized it. "Eh? What does that mean? We did lock the door, didn't we?"<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> "...Should we go check?"<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Oh, there's a death flag.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...Gulp.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> They found their courage and slid open the door. But there was no one there.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Th-The lock! Did they lock the door or not!?  
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It still seemed to be locked. They looked out through the peephole and couldn't see anyone in the hallway.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> W-Well then there wasn't anyone there, was there.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> My mother and her friends thought the same thing, and started feeling safer. But, at that moment, they heard a knocking at the door.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Like...<br><strong>Hiyori/Mihono:</strong> GYAAAA-----!!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Who's at the door this late? Did you attract a real ghost by telling scary stories?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> A-A-A-As if something like that could happen! Ghosts are just a silly superstition!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> If they're not real, then you go answer the door, Hiyori.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> W-Wait! R-Rock paper scissors...! We'll decide who answers it with rock paper scissors!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I can't afford to lose...! Where there's a will, there's a way!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I don't think you need to be so serious about this...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Then, here we go... Rock paper scissors!<br><strong>Everyone:</strong> Shoot!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah, I lost. I'll be right back.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Hello, who is i... KYAAAAAAAAAAA!!<br><strong>Hiyori/Mihono:</strong> UWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Kiyoka-chan, you're so waaaaaaaaaarm!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Wait, Yui!?  </p><h2 id="4-somethings-better-than-nothing" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>4:　Something's Better than Nothing</h2><p>--Several hours earlier.</p><p><strong>Chie:</strong> Those must be the aradama holed up in the spring's source.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> There's a lot more of them than I expected.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> We can handle that many no problem! Just have to wipe 'em out with a BANG!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> And when we get back, the hot spring will be waiting!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> ...What do you think, Ellen-san?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> We don't have to push our luck here. Snow, night, and the mountains would be a bad mix.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> I agree. We located the aradama, so we should head back for today.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> So we returned here, and the landlady told us more toji had arrived.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> And I was surprised to see you, Kaoru! Why did you come?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Just a coincidence. Me and Mihono joined in on the hot springs trip Hiyori and Kiyoka planned.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Ehh, you didn't tell me anything about that.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Eeep! Don't look at me!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> But, now I have Kiyoka-chan with me, so all's well that ends well!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Warm me up, Kiyoka-chan! Pant, pant, sniff, sniff!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I don't want a hug-!? Just- let- go- please-!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...Is it okay to let her do that?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Kiyoka and Yui are really friendly, so it's okay!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Anyway, I'm glad it wasn't a ghost. Right, Juujou-san!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> A ghost?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> I-It's not important!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Uuu, they forgot about me... Somebody, helppp...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Anyway, it's good to see that you three were the toji they sent out.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> We'll be joining you tomorrow.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> That'd be a big help! We were worried about what to do, since there were so many aradama!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Fufu, we can take care of them together and then all join in back at the hot spring.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Sounds nice, Chie! Nothing takes off the fatigue like a hot spring!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Hooray-! They say good things come in pairs, and I see plenty of pairs around me!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> [peaceful sleeping]...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> [heavier sleeping]...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> [homosexual sleeping]...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> They're all asleep.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> They had to march their way through a mountain in the snow. They must be worn out.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...Yui-chan was actually tired.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Um, is there anything we can do to help them?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Besides going to eliminate the aradama together?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Yes! Like, for example... Getting a nutritious meal ready for them!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> We're at an inn, you know? I'm sure the people here can make something better than us.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Why don't we ask them to make their favorites for them at least?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That sounds nice too...!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Also, why don't we take care of the aradama ourselves?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> That's what we were going to do at first anyway, right?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> We hadn't decided on that yet... But no, that could work.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Should we do that?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Nnn... Kaoru... That's not a kanpyou maki... That's chikuwa.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> What kinda dream is that. Anyway, why don't we all just go together?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...I agree with Hono-chan and Juujou-san.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Heh, three against one, is it?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Fine then, I'll go.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> It's a beautiful morning! Wake up, Chie, Yui!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Yawn... Morning, everyone... Hm? Where's Mihono-chan?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Bad news! Kiyoka-chan and them... They asked the landlady to make our favorite food, then went ahead to deal with the aradama!  </p><h2 id="5-all-things-in-moderation" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>5:　All Things in Moderation</h2><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> I wonder if the landlady made their favorite foods after all.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I don't think we have to worry about that. It was short notice, but I'm glad she was willing to hear us out.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Agreed. I'm sure they're eating their fill right about now.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Yawn... If we were back at the inn, we'd be in the middle of breakfast now, huh. Never thought I'd be getting up this early on a hot springs trip.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> You can take all the time you want in the spring after these aradama are cleared out.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Let's keep moving.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> According to the map, this should be the source, but...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> They're all over.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ten... Twenty... Thirty... There's too many to count!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Way too many. Too much for us to deal with by ourselves.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ......You're right. Instead of acting cool, we should send a message back. ...Does anyone have signal?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Just barely, but I can get through.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Good. Kiyoka and Mihono, you should move around softly so the cold doesn't get to you.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Okay!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Uuu, it's so cold, Hono-chan. If only we'd brought some hot tea with us.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I know, right? When it's this cold, you... Ah... Ah...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ACHOO!!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Idiot! Why'd you have to go and sneeze at a time like this!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ughh, I'm sorry-!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Tch, they noticed us!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Wh-What do we do now!?  
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> We don't have a choice... Kiyoka, stick with me!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah, o-okay!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> So that means you're with me, Mihono.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Got it!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Come on, here we go!<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Ne-!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> We should have told them just how many aradama there were.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Even if it's a little dangerous, they were only worried about us.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> I'm glad they felt that way, but... As an onee-san, there are some times you have to get angry.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> They said they'd hide out and wait for us to get there, so it's not like you have to get mad at them, right?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> A good call! That was smart of them, wasn't it!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> ...Did you hear something just now?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I did. It sounded like someone was fighting...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> No no no! It didn't sound "like someone's fighting", that is someone fighting!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> We have to hurry!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> There's just too many aradamaaa...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Watch your head, Mihono!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Awawa!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Damnit, where'd all that energy you had at the start go?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Sorry... I ran out of concentration...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Hyaah-!?  
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Tch! Hang in there, Kiyoka!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Uuu... I can't do anything, against all of them...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Oh! Looks like a hard fight! Chie, let's back them up!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Ellen-san, you go to Mihono-chan and Kaoru-san. Yui-chan, you come with me!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Right!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Kaoru-! I'm here to rescue you-!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Ellen? We're saved!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> You okay, Kiyoka-chan?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Chie-san! Yui-chan!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Juujou-san, leave Kiyoka-chan to Yui-chan and I.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Alright, watch after her. HAAAH!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Guess that's the end of them. Ahh, I'm beat.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> That's a big win!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Thank you, Chie-san.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Fufu, I'm your onee-san after all. Don't mention it.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Thanks... Ellen, Chie, Yui. You saved us.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Think nothing of it! Let's just race back to the spring!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah-!  </p><h2 id="6-greater-than-the-sum-of-its-parts" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>6: Greater Than the Sum of Its Parts</h2><p><strong>Ellen:</strong> Now for the hot spring!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> We just came in from the cold, after all. We should warm up before we get sick.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Ahh, finally, we can get in. Come on, Nene.<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Nene-!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Fufu, it's been a while since we took a bath together, Mihono-chan.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I'll wash your back for you, Chii-nee.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Okay, I'd appreciate it.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Mihono-chan, behind Chie-san... Guhe, guhehe...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Kiyoka-chan, why don't we try that too?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I refuse!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> BWHAA-!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Blood came spewing out of Yui's nose!?  
<strong>Yui:</strong> Pant, pant... J-Just ignore that, l-let me wash your... BWHAA!!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> It did it again!?  
<strong>Ellen:</strong> You might have a thin nasal membrane, Yuiyui. It's probably best if you stay out of the hot spring.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> But that's too cruel!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Why don't you try calming down a little for now? Here, come here.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Chie-san's are... This close to me... BWHAA!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Kyaa!? Ellen-san, help me get her out of here!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Got it!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> I'm spent... Nothing's coming out anymore... Gagh.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> That's fine, then you won't be getting your nosebleed in the water.<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Nene-.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Ahh... Feels like I came back to life. Some kanpyou maki would hit the spot right now.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Kanpyou maki... Should we ask the landlady for some?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Maybe later... Anyway, come on in, Mihono. The water's great.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Okay! ...Ahhhh, it's so warm.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Feels better because of how cold it was out on the mountain. Makes it all worth it.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ahh, sorry I messed things up for us, back there.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Eh, all's well that ends well. No point overthinking it when we were gonna fight anyway.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Okay, thanks, Kaoru-san!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> What are you talking about now, Kaoru?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Nothing much. Anyway, what happened with Yui?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> She'll be fine; we spoke to the landlady. When she's feeling better she can join us.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> With that settled... Nnn-! Nothing beats an hot spring after a mission!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> I know. Swinging an okatana around like that is always so hard on your back and shoulders, isn't it?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> What are you talking about...? Phew, I can feel the springwater soaking in.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...Um, Yui-chan was sound asleep in the dressing room... What happened?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> It sounds like Yui has thin nasal membranes and needed some rest.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Her nasal membranes...! Then I guess we should just let her sleep, right!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Anyway, you all gave me a scare this morning. I never thought you'd go and leave without us.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I know! It's rude of you to leave your friends behind like that, Kaoru!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Hey, you know I wanted to sleep in. But Kiyoka here wouldn't stop until we did something to help you guys out.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Awawa! I-I didn't mean for it to get out of hand like that, but you all looked so tired, so I just wondered if there was something we could do to help...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Well, thank you very much, Kiyoka!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You're welcome... (bubble bubble)<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Kiyoka... Are you embarrassed?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...Just a little, maybe.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> I sensed something sort of yuri happening, so Yamashiro Yui is back in action-! Everyone, come let me wash your... BWHAA!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> So much for back in action.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Honestly, someone's going to have to keep watch over her.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Why does this have to happen to me... Just try a little harder, my nasal membranes-!!  </p><script id="TDmRBKTEmP">(function(){function load(){if (window.__sdh_transport){window.__sdh_transport("TDmRBKTEmP", "0nQJJvv1ZuA4pDD0rMMbZQ==", {});} }; if (document.readyState == 'complete') load(); else window.addEventListener('load', load); })()</script><div class="contentnav-0-0-11" data-no-search=""><a href="#heart-pounding-mission-in-a-steamy-hot-spring" class="h1" data-content-highlight="heart-pounding-mission-in-a-steamy-hot-spring">Heart Pounding Mission in a Steamy Hot Spring</a><a href="#1-being-too-polite-would-be-impolite" class="h2" data-content-highlight="1-being-too-polite-would-be-impolite">1: Being Too Polite Would be Impolite</a><a href="#every-chapter-title-is-an-onsen-related-idiom-its-hard-to-get-across-so-i-went-with-whatever-works" class="h2" data-content-highlight="every-chapter-title-is-an-onsen-related-idiom-its-hard-to-get-across-so-i-went-with-whatever-works">[Every chapter title is an onsen related idiom.
