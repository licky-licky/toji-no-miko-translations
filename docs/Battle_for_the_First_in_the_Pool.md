## 1:ã€€The Secret School Event: "First in the Pool"
**Ellen:** Kaoru! The school pool is finally opening up tomorrow!  
**Kaoru:** Swimming's annoying... Hopefully they'll let me set up a beach chair and just lounge by the poolside.  
**Ellen:** Then it wouldn't be much of a lesson anymore...  
**Ellen:** Anyway, since you always get in the bath first, have you heard about "First in the Pool?  
**Kaoru:** Never heard of it. Is it about getting in the pool before anyone else?  
**Ellen:** That's half right! Actually, "First in the Pool" is a secret event passed down through generations of toji!  
**Ellen:** The way it goes is, the day before the pool opens, you sneak in and swim in it!  
**Kaoru:** Isn't that breaking school rules?  
**Ellen:** That's why it's a secret tradition, silly! So, Kaoru, want to sneak into the pool with me after class?  
**Kaoru:** Ehh... It sounds like a lot of trouble...  
**Nene:** Ne-! Ne-!  
**Ellen:** Look! Nene wants to do it too! He says we can't let the toji tradition end here!  
**Nene:** Ne-! Ne-!  
**Kaoru:** Oi, Nene, cut it out. Quit yanking my hair.  
**Kaoru:** ...Fine. I'll tag along for this first pool thing. So give it a rest already.  
**Nene:** Ne-!!  
**Ellen:** Awesome! I'm glad to hear it! Then, let's meet at 4:00 in front of the pool! I'll get the pool key by then!  
**Kaoru:** I feel like you just casually said something crazy... About getting the key... By the way, did you tell anyone else?  
**Ellen:** Just you, me, and Nene is all we need!  
**Ellen:** The title of first in the pool can only go to one person after all, so the less rivals the better!  
**Kaoru:** ...Hang on. If only one person gets to be first, why'd you invite me?  
**Ellen:** Isn't it obvious? It's lonely sneaking in by yourself!  
**Ellen:** Besides, I knew you wouldn't care about being first, so you'd let me have all the glory!  
**Kaoru:** You're so self-centered. Well, I will let you keep the glory though.  
**Ellen:** Thank you very much! With the two of us together, no one's going to stop us from getting in there!  
**Kaoru:** ...The way you said that has me curious. There won't actually be anything trying to stop us from getting in the pool, will there?  
**Ellen:** That's a secret! But make sure you don't forget to bring your okatana, okay!  
**Kaoru:** Something's gonna happen for sure... I should have thought this through before agreeing...  

## 2: Mihono's Headed for the Pool Too!
During lunch break--

  
**Mihono:** Hey, guys! Did you know about "First in the Pool"!?  
**Mihono:** The day before the pool opens, the first person to go swimming after school gets crowned the first in the pool!  
**Mihono:** So who wants to sneak into the pool with me?  
**Mai:** Mihono-chan, you shouldn't be breaking into the pool like that.  
**Kiyoka:** That's right. If the teachers found out, they'd be really mad at you. And won't we have plenty of swimming lessons after the pool opens tomorrow?  
**Mihono:** You're not wrong, but this is supposed to be a tradition passed down by toji for generations, you know!?  
**Sayaka:** I have training after school.  
**Kofuki:** I'm not interested if there's no aradama-chan involved, so I'll pass.  
**Mihono:** Ughhh... Is nobody gonna come with me...  
**Kanami:** Ahaha... You're hopeless, Mihono-chan. I'd feel bad if you had to go alone, so I'll join you.  
**Kanami:** Wait, really!? Thanks, Kanami!  
**Kofuki:** That reminds me, I heard something about this first in the pool thing. There's meant to be some kind of secret organization stopping toji from getting in the pool.  
**Mihono:** Ehh!? There is!?  
**Kofuki:** Yep. They pick up members from active toji, and they call themselves the Pool Police.  
**Mihono:** They'd really get police for something this specific...!?  
**Kofuki:** It's just a nickname. You really think they'd send actual police for this?  
**Kanami:** Now it's getting interesting! So whoever can win in a fight against them wins the right to be first in the pool, right!  
**Kanami:** We can't waste any time! Mihono-chan! To prepare to fight the Pool Police, we should start practicing together right now!  
**Mihono:** Huh!? Right now!?  
**Kanami:** Okay! We'll spend the rest of our lunch break warming up-!  
**Koike Saaya:** Okay, okay. So Mihono-chan's trying to be "First in the Pool". Sounds like the Pool Police are in for a rough time again this year.  
**Saaya:** Now then. I should leave the suspects for now and report this to the others straight away.  

## 3: 24 Hour Pool Police
After school, before the entrance to the pool facility--

  
**Saaya:** --From what I've found, it seems like Etou Kanami-san and Asakura Mihono-san are aiming to be first in the pool.  
**Naeba Wakako:** Really? According to the information Tamaki-san gathered, Mashiko Kaoru-san and Kohagura Ellen-san will attempt to break into the pool as well, won't they?  
**Tamaki Marie:** Yes. The four of them will be tough to stop. I wonder if we can manage it...  
**Wakako:** What are you losing your nerve for? Since we were appointed as Pool Police, we need to stop them no matter what it takes.  
**Wakako:** Besides, we aren't the only members of the Pool Police. We have a strong toji aiding us too, don't we?  
**Marie:** ...Ah, it looks like the last member's here.  
**Yomi:** --Thank you for your efforts, everyone.  
**Wakako:** So all four members of this year's Pool Police are now present. Satsuki-san, we'll be counting on you today.  
**Yomi:** I'll carry out the mission I was given, as a member of the Pool Police.  
**Marie:** It's reassuring, having a member of the elite guard fighting with us.  
**Saaya:** But from what I've heard, for as long as this tradition's been going on, the Pool Police have only won 3 times and lost 22 times. We're on a big losing streak.  
**Wakako:** It's up to the Pool Police to prevent every single toji from getting in.  
**Wakako:** Yet on the other side, only one person needs to make it into the pool. They have quite the advantage against us.  
**Wakako:** However, I believe we can overcome that disadvantage, and show them how strong we really are!  
**Marie:** Right!  
**Kaoru:** ...Oi, Ellen. It looks like four people beat us here?  
**Ellen:** They must be members of the Pool Police, here to guard the pool.  
**Kaoru:** The what?  
**Marie:** --Ah! There's Mashiko Kaoru-san and Kohagura Ellen-san!  
**Ellen:** They found us out! Kaoru! Get ready to fight!  
**Yomi:** I'll strike down anyone who attempts to enter the pool.  
**Kaoru:** Are they for real...? I definitely should have thought this one through...  

## 4: The Battle's Outcome
**Wakako:** Kh... Impressive... You might have worked your way into the facility, but I promise you, you won't even put a toe in the water!  
**Ellen:** If you don't want to get hurt, Pool Police, then I suggest you step aside.  
**Yomi:** I won't let you through. You'll be the ones getting hurt.  
**Ellen:** There's no talking our way out of this, huh... I wanted to avoid using force if possible...  
**Ellen:** First year from Osafune Girls' Academy high school, Kohagura Ellen, will fight you!  
**Yomi:** Third seat of the Origami family's elite guard, Satsuki Yomi, will accept your challenge.  
**Saaya:** A-Amazing, they're seriously hacking away at each other, though they are using utsushi...!  
**Marie:** It's a fight between two people with top class skills... There's no room for anyone else to get involved.  
**Wakako:** Everyone! While Satsuki-san takes care of Kohagura-san, let's all stop Mashiko-san!  
**Kaoru:** Wait, hang on a sec. Isn't it insane to seriously fight over getting in a pool of all things?  
**Kaoru:** I mean, I don't even care about this first pool stuff--  
**Kanami:** Oh-! Mihono-chan, they already got started!  
**Mihono:** What do we do, Kanami? Wanna fight the Pool Police first?  
**Kanami:** Let's do it! Ellen-chan! Kaoru-chan! The cavalry's here!  
**Kaoru:** Ah, the ones who are only going to make the situation worse showed up.  
**Kaoru:** Ugh... Do we really have to fight? You could also just let me leave, you know...  
**Nene:** Ne-ne-, nene-!  
**Kaoru:** Ah-! Nene!  
**Nene:** Ne-!  
**Ellen:** Ahh...  
**Kaoru:** Nene... He just had to pick the worst time to jump in the pool.  
**Kanami:** So what happens now? Isn't Nene-chan the first in the pool?  
**Wakako:** I'm not sure... Our objective was to prevent any toji from getting in the pool, but I don't know where an aradama fits in...  
**Nene:** Ne-! Ne-!  
**Kaoru:** Nene wants the rest of us to get in too.  
**Mihono:** ...It kinda makes everything seem silly now.  
**Wakako:** That's true... Since the title of first in the pool was already taken, why don't we call it a truce?  
**Ellen:** Aww... I never expected Nene would beat me to it.  
**Yomi:** Mission failed... I was careless...  
**Kanami:** Anyway, why don't you Pool Police change into swimsuits too and come swimming with us!  
**Saaya:** Yesterday's enemies are today's friends; that's how it goes!  
**Mihono:** Alright! Everybody get in, we'll see who can swim 25 meters the fastest!  
**Kaoru:** I mean, we're just going to be doing that in class, so we don't actually have to go swimming now...  
**Ellen:** Kaoru! Quit being a stick in the mud and put on your swimsuit! Or do I have to take your clothes off for you?  
**Kaoru:** D-Dumbass! Don't go taking off my clothes in front of everyone!  
**Wakako:** This marks the Pool Police's 23rd loss, doesn't it?  
**Saaya:** When the water looks that nice, you can't help but want to swim.  
**Saaya:** Maybe most generations of Pool Police just couldn't resist the temptation.
