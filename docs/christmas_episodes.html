What would be good to give them? Would it be okay if I just picked out something I liked?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Oh, Sanae-san?<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Musumi-san...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I didn't expect to see you here! Are you out shopping?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> The investigation team is having a party on Christmas, so I'm here to buy some things!<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> I'm sort of in the same boat.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> I'm going to a party with Juujou-san, but they're going to be doing a gift exchange there, so...<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> ...<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Could I ask you for a bit of advice on something, Musumi-san?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah, sure, of course. If I can help.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> You see... I'm actually worried about what to get for the gift exchange. If it were you, what would you buy?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Hmm... That is a little tough to pick something out for.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> If it were me... Let's see... I think I'd probably go with something consumable or that you could eat.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Because then, it would be fine no matter who gets it.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> That makes sense... Thanks, Musumi-san.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Don't mention it! Good luck finding the right present!<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Yeah.  </p><h2 id="xmas-20---sanae-end-i-dont-feel-like-i-can-lose" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Xmas' 20 - Sanae: End]: I Don't Feel Like I Can Lose</h2><p><strong>Aradama:</strong> OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!<br><strong>Man:</strong> UWAHHHHHHH!?

There's not much we can do about it; aradama don't care if it's Christmas.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> But, did you finish getting everyone evacuated over there?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Yeah. I came over to help you out, though... it looks like things are fine here.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Just about. You should go over to see how the others are doing.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Got it.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Ah, by the way.

I'll look forward to it.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> And then, I'll trade you my gift, Juujou-san. I went through a lot of ideas, but I settled on a handkerchief...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> I'll be sure to take good care of it.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Anyway, I'll see you later.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Okay!<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> GYAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> An aradama!?
