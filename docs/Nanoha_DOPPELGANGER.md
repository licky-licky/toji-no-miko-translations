Nanoha DOPPELGANGER
===================
:::note
As per usual for collabs, the countdowns are voiced. Unusually, the game decided to combine both parts of the event into one, so I have them all here even if the numbering is off.

## 1: What Are the Toji Like? ~2 Days Until the Collab Event~
**Nanoha:** Fate-chan, Hayate-chan.  
**Nanoha:** Have you heard about our next job yet?  
**Fate:** Mmhm, I heard, Nanoha.  
**Fate:** We're going to an Earth in a different world to recover a Lost Logia.  
**Hayate:** Sounds like they don't have magic technology there, but they said they have these people called toji.  
**Nanoha:** Ah, that was in the data I got. They're defenders of justice, who protect everyone with okatana!  
**Fate:** They sound almost like samurai, don't they?  
**Hayate:** Sure do. If Signum was coming along, she'd probably want to go and spar with them.  
**Fate:** That does sound like something Signum would say.  
**Nanoha:** Toji... I wonder what they're like. I'm excited to meet them!  


## 2: Are Aradama Something Scary? ~1 Days Until the Collab Event~
**Nanoha:** By the way, have you two heard any details about this Lost Logia?  
**Hayate:** I only heard the name. They said it's an "Akabane Sword".  
**Fate:** Me too.  
**Nanoha:** Oh well. In that case, we'll just have to pick up more information where we get there.  
**Fate:** I'd like to recover it before anyone can get hurt.  
**Hayate:** That's for sure.  
**Hayate:** Though, we'd better watch out too. From the sound of it, there's these nasty things called "aradama" in the Earth we're going to.  
**Nanoha:** Since the toji eliminate aradama, does that mean they're some kind of monster?  
**Fate:** It looks like they sent us pictures too, Nanoha.  
**Nanoha:** So that's an aradama...  
**Fate:** Ah, there's people there fighting the aradama. Are they the toji?  
**Nanoha:** They look a little older than us... I think?  
**Hayate:** So that's how they fight against aradama. They're kinda cool, huh.  
**Hayate:** Well, I don't think we'll have to fight against aradama ourselves, but we should be careful just to be sure.  
**Nanoha:** Sure thing, Hayate-chan!  
**Nanoha:** So then... Let's go!  

## 1: The Doppelganger Rumors
**Kiyoka:** By the way, have you heard the rumors about the doppelgangers?  
**Sayaka:** Doppelgangers?  
**Kanami:** It means somebody who's exactly like you, Sayaka-chan.  
**Sayaka:** There's rumors about that?  
**Kiyoka:** There are! In fact, there's a rumor going around the Five Traditions about people's doppelganger's showing up!!  
**Sayaka:** ...There's people who look exactly the same showing up?  
**Kanami:** Sounds like it!  
**Kanami:** I heard, sometime before Halloween, people were saying "I ran into myself!" and stuff like that.  
**Kiyoka:** At first it felt like, since Halloween was coming up, they must spreading around as some kind of prank.  
**Kiyoka:** But, even after Halloween, it didn't go away, and there's more and more people saying they saw their doppleganger!  
**Sayaka:** ...Did you two see your dopplegangers?  
**Kanami:** I wish, but I don't think so.  
**Kanami:** If I had my doppleganger, we could spar with each other anywhere anytime!  
**Kiyoka:** I can see you doing that, Etou-san.  
**Kiyoka:** I haven't seen mine either. But... I don't think I want to meet them.  
**Kiyoka:** Wouldn't it be a little scary, meeting someone exactly like you?  
**Sayaka:** It's scary?  
**Kiyoka:** Mmhm, for me at least. Would you want to meet someone just like you, Itomi-san?  
**Sayaka:** ...I don't know. But...  
**Kanami:** But... what?  
**Sayaka:** If there were two Mais, there could be so many cookies it would be bad.  
**Kanami:** Two Mai-chans making cookies... It'd be all you can eat.  
**Sayaka:** If that happens, I'll share with everyone.  
**Sayaka:** What about you, Suu?  
**Suu:** Ah, I'm good.  
**Sayaka:** Eh?  
**Suu:** Err, I mean! Uhh, uhh...  
**Suu:** (I know she said to treat her normal, but Sayaka-chan is Renpu's deadly professional!)		[Suu calls Sayaka 'Hissatsu Shigotonin', a reference to a famous period drama about an assassin for hire]  
**Suu:** (I really am kind of bad at dealing with her... I'll just try not to offend her here...)  
**Suu:** Talking about doppelgangers, it's like that, right? How, you meet three people just like you, and they might try to sue.		[There is a very lame pun here about how, if you meet "au to" 3 people just like you, you're out "au to"]  
**Suu:** Get it?  
**Kanami/Sayaka/Kiyoka:** ......  
**Suu:** Haha, hahaha...  
**Suu:** (C-Crap! Now I went and froze the room over!)  
**Sayaka:** If you meet three people just like you, they'll sue?  
**Suu:** Please, I'm begging you, don't bring it back up. It's just something that popped into my headdd!  
**Sayaka:** ?  
**Kiyoka:** Inami-san... I don't that one works...  
**Suu:** Just let it gooo!!  
**Kanami:** Our phones... All four of us at once?  
**Kiyoka:** That's got to be a mission... right? Do you think we're all on the same mission?  
**Suu:** (Ah, that means it should be easy!)  
**Sayaka:** ...It's an Akabane sword recovery mission, with the members here and Satsuki Yomi.  
**Suu:** Eh, with Satsuki-san...?  
**Kiyoka:** Is something wrong, Inami-san?  
**Suu:** No... It's just, I'm sort of avoiding doing a little training with Satsuki-san...  
**Suu:** (I ran away from this week's utsushi increasing program again...)  
**Kiyoka:** I think it'd be better if you made sure to do your training though.  
**Suu:** I guess so...  
**Kanami:** Then, while we're on this mission, you can apologize to Satsuki-san and tell her you'll make sure to show up to your training!  
**Suu:** Wait, that's a little... Hey, don't drag me with youuu!  
**Yomi:** I see a response on the spectrum finder.  
**Yomi:** There's a high probability that aradama will be in the area surrounding the Akabane sword. All members, please be on guard.  
**Everyone:** Right!  
**Yomi:** The signal vanished? All members, please confirm on your spectrum finders.  
**Suu:** It's... gone.  
**Kiyoka:** You're right... What do you think happened?  
**Kanami:** Maybe somebody beat the aradama? If the signal disappeared, that's all it could be, right?  
**Sayaka:** Is there a different unit here too?  
**Suu:** Did they double book? Then, that means we can leave it all to that unit and go back home!  
**Yomi:** If that is the case, the other unit will be responsible for suppressing the aradama while we hurry to recover the Akabane sword.  
**Suu:** Great!  
**Yomi:** We'll go confirm at the scene. All members, please apply utsushi.  
**Yomi:** ...We're moving.  
**Suu:** It's a good thing we'll finish this mission smoothly, huh!  
**Kiyoka:** ......  
**Suu:** ...What are you making that face for, Kiyoka-san?  
**Kiyoka:** I just have a bit of a bad feeling about this...  
**Suu:** D-Don't go raising flags like that. You're spooking me out of nowhere...  
**Sayaka:** ...I wish Mai were here.  
**Kanami:** I know what you mean. It'd be a real relief having Mai with us, since she can use myougan.  
**Sayaka:** ...Mm.  
**Suu:** ...Eh? Is there actually something here...?  
**Yomi:** Please put an end to the chatter. ...I can see something.  
**Kiyoka:** Is that Hono-chan, Chie-san, and Yui-chan?  
**Kanami:** It is them.  
**Suu:** Thank goodness... Everyone was looking so serious, I was getting worried.  
**Sayaka:** Did the investigation team have an Akabane sword recovery mission?  
**Kiyoka:** We didn't... I never heard about one...  
**Kiyoka:** Hey, Hono-cha...  
**??? (Nanoha):** DIVINE BUSTER!  

## 2: The Doppelgangers' True Form
**??? (Nanoha):** DIVINE BUSTER!  
**Mihono/Chie/Yui:** ...  
**Kiyoka:** Everyone!!  
**??? (Nanoha):** --!!  
**Kanami:** I don't really get what's going on, but... we have to stop that girl!  
**Sayaka:** Mihono! Chie! Yui!  
**Sayaka:** We'll save you... right away!  
**??? (Fate):** I won't let you!!  
**Sayaka:** !? Where'd she come from...!?  
**Kanami:** Watch out! Sayaka-chan!  
**??? (Fate):** --!  
**Kanami:** Are you okay?  
**Sayaka:** Mm... Thank you, Kanami.  
**Suu:** When did that girl get in front of Sayaka-san...? Was she using jin'i?  
**Yomi:** A sword made of light...? That doesn't look like an okatana...  
**??? (Hayate):** Who'd have thought backup would get here so quick. Nanoha-chan!  
**??? (Nanoha):** Got it! Divine... Shooter!  
**Suu:** She's shooting something!?  
**Yomi:** All members, intercept fire.  
**Kiyoka:** Intercept... Wait, can we even cut that with okatana!?  
**Kanami:** We'll just have to find out!  
**Kanami:** Chidori can even cut through lightning, so... Even if I don't really get what this stuff is, it should be able to cut it too!  
**Kanami:** HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!  
**???:** (What if...)  
**???:** DON'T!!  
**Suu:** It missed?  
**Sayaka:** ...No. They fired away at the last second.  
**??? (Fate):** Nanoha? What's wrong?  
**??? (Nanoha):** Fate-chan, Hayate-chan. I'm sure these girls are different.  
**??? (Hayate):** You say that, but... Didn't they come just in time to back up the rest?  
**??? (Nanoha):** Still, I think they're different.  
**??? (Hayate):** Well, I guess you're right they don't feel the same as the ones we've been fighting so far...  
**??? (Nanoha):** See! So... Let's talk this over.  
**??? (Hayate):** That's just like you, Nanoha-chan. What about you, Fate-chan?  
**??? (Fate):** ...I think it's fine. I trust Nanoha.  
**??? (Nanoha):** Thanks, Fate-chan!  
**??? (Nanoha):** So then... We're sorry we attacked you! It might be a little late, but we'd like to talk with you!  
**Suu:** They want to talk...  
**Kiyoka:** ...What do we do?  
**Kanami:** Let's hear them out.  
**Kanami:** When I crossed swords with that blonde girl... I didn't get the feeling she was a bad person.  
**Kanami:** So we should try talking with them first.  
**Suu/Kiyoka:** ...  
**Kanami:** Look close, listen well, trust your instincts... And we can decide from there.  
**Nanoha:** My name is Takamachi Nanoha. And, these two are...  
**Fate:** Fate T. Harlaown.  
**Hayate:** I'm Yagami Hayate.  
**Kanami:** So, Nanoha-chan, Fate-chan, and Hayate-chan.  
**Kanami:** You can explain all this to us, right? Like, what that power was you attacked us with...  
**Nanoha:** That was magic.  
**Kiyoka:** Magic...? You mean like, the kind in games and stories?  
**Hayate:** You can think of it like that. We're contract mages from the Time-Space Administrative Bureau, and we came here from another Earth.  
**Suu:** Magic and mages and another Earth? S-She suddenly threw out a bunch of fantasy stuff...  
**Sayaka:** But, I don't feel like they're lying.  
**Kanami:** ...Same.  
**Nanoha:** The reason we came to this Earth was to investigate something. We detected a strange reading, and...  
**Kiyoka:** Why did you attack Hono-chan and them?  
**Nanoha:** That's because... Earlier, those girls came attacking us, so we only fought back in self-defense.  
**Nanoha:** And... Uhh. Er, could you tell us your names?  
**Kanami:** Oh, I'm Etou Kanami. And, going around, this is Itomi Sayaka-chan, Musumi Kiyoka-san, Inami Suu-chan, and Satsuki Yomi-san.  
**Nanoha:** Thank you very much, Kanami-san.  
**Nanoha:** And we thought you were with them, Kanami-san, so we fought you too... But you seemed sort of different... Ah!  
**Nanoha:** We used a non-lethal setting, so, while they're unconscious, those girls shouldn't be hurt or anything!  
**Suu:** Non-lethal setting... So magic can do stuff like that...  
**Yomi:** ...I'll check on Asakura-san and the others. If they're only unconscious, I'll take that into consideration.  
**Yomi:** Musumi-san, please come with me.  
**Kiyoka:** Ah, right!  
**Kanami:** Oh, I'll go too!  
**Kanami:** You know... why were Mihono-chan and them here in the first place?  
**Kiyoka:** I'm not sure. They're supposed to be away on an expedition right about now... Huh?  
**Kiyoka:** That okatana... That's not Kashuu Kiyomitsu.  
**Yomi:** This is an Akabane sword.  
**Mihono?:** --!  
**Kiyoka:** KYAA!?  
**Kiyoka:** This person... They're not Hono-chan! It's an aradama!  
**Mimic Aradama:** ...  
**Sayaka:** Watch out!  
**Suu:** EEP!?  
**Suu:** (Even though it looked like Mihono-san... She didn't even hesitate to chop it down!)  
**Mimic Aradama:** ...  
**Yomi:** ...Setouchi-san and Yamashiro-san are aradama as well.  
**Yomi:** --!!  
**Yomi:** ...You mentioned a strange reading. Did it have to do with these aradama?  
**Hayate:** We're still investigating, so we don't know.  
**Fate:** Are aradama like this rare?  
**Kiyoka:** Aradama that can mimic a person this closely are definitely rare.  
**Fate:** Then... I can't say for sure, but it's probably connected.  
**Yomi:** ...Have you all heard the rumors about doppelgangers?  
**Kanami:** Ah, we have.  
**Yomi:** Currently, the Special Defense Team has had considerable reports of damage caused by these doppelgangers.  
**Yomi:** We still don't know what is causing this situation.  
**Kiyoka:** If the doppelgangers are actually mimic aradama, we have to solve this right away!  
**Nanoha:** Um... Please let us work with you!  
**Kanami:** Huh?  
**Nanoha:** The reason we came to this world was to prevent a crisis that might happen!  
**Nanoha:** Even if it's not our world, I don't want to see people in trouble, or sad, or crying... I want to rescue them! We want to help you!  
**Fate/Hayate:** Please let us!  
**Yomi:** ...  
**Kanami:** I think it's fine.  
**Kanami:** We'll need Nanoha-chan, Fate-chan, and Hayate-chan's help to get to the bottom of this mission.  
**Yomi:** ...Very well then.  
**Yomi:** First, I'll make a report to the Sword Administration Bureau. Once that's finished, we'll begin taking action.  
**Nanoha/Fate/Hayate:** Thank you very much!  
**Yomi:** This is Satsuki Yomi, of the Special Defense Team. I've identified the true form of these doppelgangers to be aradama.  
**Yomi:** Their disguises are fairly sophisticated, so it's likely they will be mistaken for the real person. If any toji are behaving strangely... Eh?  
**Yomi:** ...Yes.  
**Kiyoka:** What's wrong?  
**Yomi:** It seems that Ban-san, Kitora-san, and Tsubakuro-san have all taken out Akabane swords.  

## 3: A Promise for After We're Done
**Kanami:** It was really shocking, seeing aradama mimic Mihono-chan and them.  
**Kiyoka:** Yeah...  
**Kiyoka:** Even more than when we fought mimic aradama before... This Mihono-chan felt more like a person to me.  
**Kanami:** Yeah... maybe you're right. The mimic aradama back then were more like monsters than this...  
**Kiyoka:** I don't really want to remember it... That was traumatizing...  
**Sayaka:** If she didn't have an Akabane sword, would you have realized it?  
**Kiyoka:** N-No. That's how much it seemed like the real thing.  
**Sayaka:** ...  
**Sayaka:** Nanoha, Fate, Hayate. What was it like fighting Mihono and them?  
**Nanoha:** I don't know much about swordfighting styles and that kind of thing, but they were using their swords properly.  
**Suu:** If it's enough for there to be rumors about them, the doppelgangers are probably pretty close to the real person, right?  
**Kanami:** Do you think there's aradama mimicking us too?  
**Kiyoka:** Who can say? We don't know what basis is causing mimic aradama to show up...  
**Fate:** We've fought several mimic aradama so far, but none of them looked like any of you.  
**Hayate:** Oh yeah, Nanoha-chan! We'd better hand those over to the toji.  
**Nanoha:** Ah! These are Akabane swords we took from mimic aradama we fought before.  
**Yomi:** I'll hold onto them.  
**Yomi:** Though... why did you recover their Akabane swords?  
**Nanoha:** We thought that maybe it was these swords... the Akabane swords that were causing the toji to act strangely...  
**Fate:** Though, it was them being mimic aradama that was strange, so our assumption was off...  
**Hayate:** Ah! We just left the mimic aradama like they were too!  
**Yomi:** Without an okatana, you won't be able to suppress aradama. I believe that should still be the case for magic.  
**Nanoha:** So we can't beat them with magic...  
**Hayate:** ...Though, something comes to mind.  
**Nanoha:** Fate-chan, Hayate-chan.  
**Fate:** Right.  
**Hayate:** Yeah, we'd better prepare just in case.  
**Yomi:** If you use magic to cover for us, there won't be any issues. We'll dispose of the mimic aradama.  
**Kanami:** Hey, Nanoha-chan, Fate-chan, Hayate-chan. Tell me what it was like fighting toji.  
**Kanami:** I want to know how it felt for a magical girl.  
**Fate:** The first that comes to mind is... They were hard to fight.  
**Kanami:** Hard to fight?  
**Fate:** They would grow fast, powerful, and tough... You can't let your guard down fighting someone capable at swordfighting.  
**Kiyoka:** That would be jin'i, hachimanriki, and kongoushin.  
**Fate:** Also, I don't get many chances to fight with people who know real swordfighting, so I learned lots from it!  
**Kanami:** Well then, once this is over, let's spar together! The way you were moving before got me interested, Fate-chan!  
**Sayaka:** I'm interested too. I want to try fighting seriously with Fate.  
**Fate:** The pleasure would be all mine!  
**Kanami:** What about you two, Nanoha-chan, Hayate-chan?  
**Nanoha:** I think I'll... hold off. I'm not so good with close quarters combat...  
**Kanami:** It didn't really look that way to me though...  
**Hayate:** I'll pass on that too. Signum would've been happy to, but... Ah, Signum's from my family; she's a swordfighter.  
**Fate:** She's a very powerful knight.  
**Nanoha:** You're right, she probably would love to fight with the toji.  
**Fate:** Will you be joining us, Kiyoka-san, Suu-san?  
**Kiyoka:** Sure, if you'll have me.  
**Suu:** I'll stay out of it by any means necessary! Cause there's no way I could handle that!!  
**Yomi:** Please leave any sparring until after this case is resolved.  
**Kanami:** Got it! Let's work hard at this, Fate-chan!  
**Fate:** Of course, Kanami-san!  

## 4: Meeting the Aradama
**Yomi:** It seems that Ban-san, Kitora-san, and Tsubakuro-san have all taken out Akabane swords.  
**Kiyoka:** If it were just Tsugumi-san and Mirja-san, I could understand it... But Tsubakuro-san being in there feels wrong.  
**Yomi:** There's no doubt those three are mimic aradama.  
**Yomi:** Since they've taken Akabane swords, we can't ignore them. We'll go take care of this.  
**Nanoha:** What should we do?  
**Yomi:** We'll split into three teams.  
**Yomi:** First... Etou-san and Takamachi-san.  
**Kanami/Nanoha:** Yes!  
**Yomi:** Please go after Ban-san.  
**Kanami:** Understood. I'm with you, Nanoha-chan!  
**Nanoha:** Okay, Kanami-san!  
**Yomi:** Next... Musumi-san and Harlaown-san.  
**Kiyoka/Fate:** Yes.  
**Yomi:** The three of us, with me included, will go after Kitora-san.  
**Fate:** I'll be in your care, Yomi-san, Kiyoka-san.  
**Kiyoka:** Mmhm! Let's do our best together, Fate-chan!  
**Yomi:** Lastly...  
**Hayate:** Me, Sayaka-san, and Suu-san are going after this Tsubakuro-san person, right!  
**Yomi:** Yes, please do.  
**Suu:** Wait, hang on a minute! Why do I have to fight Tsubakuro-sama!?  
**Yomi:** I'd have Itomi-san handle Tsubakuro-san. Inami-san, please give Itomi-san your support.  
**Sayaka:** ...Mm, I'll beat Tsubakuro Yume.  
**Suu:** There's no way I can do this!  
**Yomi:** You should be fine.  
**Suu:** What gives you that idea!?  
**Hayate:** Hey now. Let's just give it our best shot, Suu-san.  
**Suu:** Hayate-chan... Actually, it's hard to tell which of us is older here...  
**Hayate:** You think so? Doesn't seem that way to me.  
**Yomi:** With that, all members, please head towards your targets.  
**Kanami:** Found you... Ban-san!  
**Tsugumi?:** Oh? What's wrong, Etou-san? That girl with you, is she lost?  
**Kanami:** No, she's not lost... Wait... Ban-san...?  
**Tsugumi?:** Yes? Do you see anyone besides me here?  
**Kanami:** I don't...  
**Kanami:** (This is just like talking to the real Ban-san...)  
**Tsugumi?:** If you don't need anything from me, could I leave? I'm in a bit of a hurry.  
**Kanami:** (She's just like the real thing. If I didn't know any better, I'd be fooled for sure.)  
**Nanoha:** ...Kanami-san, please be careful.  
**Kanami:** Don't worry, Nanoha-chan. I was just surprised at how similar it is to the real thing.  
**Tsugumi?:** Ah-, did you just come to chat? Then you're in my way.  
**Nanoha:** What is it you're after? Why did you take an Akabane sword?  
**Tsugumi Mimic:**  ......So you figured it all out. Because of this girl?  
**Nanoha:** Please give us the Akabane sword.  
**Tsugumi:** I refuse. This is something we need.  
**Tsugumi:** Though... Against Etou-san, I won't have a chance. There's no other way around it; I'll have to call for help.  
**Kanami:** Help?  
**Mimic Aradama:** ...  
**Tsugumi:** Please handle them-.  
**Mimic Aradama:** --!  
**Nanoha:** Kanami-san!  
**Nanoha:** I'll stop the aradama from moving with Bind! That's your chance!  
**Kanami:** Leave it to me!  
**Nanoha:** Here goes... Bind!  
**Tsugumi:** Gh, my body won't move!? What is this...!  
**Nanoha:** Now!  
**Kanami:** HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!  
**Tsugumi:** Kh, for this to...  
**NAnoha:** We did it, Kanami-san! Now for the rest of the aradama...  
**Kanami:** I already beat them.  
**Nanoha:** Already!?  
**Kanami:** I did have you backing me up.  
**Nanoha:** I didn't know you were that powerful, Kanami-san...  
**Kanami:** Thanks for the compliment! But, so long as I have your help, I'm as strong as a hundred people!  
**Kanami:** Anyway, we got the Akabane sword, though... what do you think she was going to do with it...?  
**Nanoha:** We probably should have asked before we beat her.  
**Kanami:** ...Ah.  
**Fate:** YAAAAAAAAHH!!  
**Mirja Mimic:** What is that speed!?  
**Fate:** Kiyoka-san!  
**Kiyoka:** Right!  
**Kiyoka:** HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!  
**Mirja Mimic:** Krh, Musumi Kiyokaaa!!  
**Kiyoka:** ...Don't call my name!  
**Kiyoka:** The real Mirja-san... is much more impressive than you!  
**Mirja:** Ggh...!?  
**Yomi:** It's over.  
**Yomi:** Why did you withdraw an Akabane sword?  
**Mirja Mimic:** I was only following orders! I have nothing more to say!  
**Yomi:** Is that so.  
**Yomi:** -!!  
**Mirja Mimic:** Gh...  
**Yomi:** Suppression complete.  
**Yomi:** Musumi-san, please recover the Akabane sword.  
**Kiyoka:** R-Right!  
**Fate:** I'll help you.  
**Kiyoka:** Thank you. You know... You're incredible, Fate-chan.  
**Kiyoka:** Going around with that flash of yellow light... It's like seeing lightning.  
**Fate:** Thank you very much.  
**Fate:** Though, you move quite quickly yourself, Kiyoka-san... You were strong.  
**Kiyoka:** That's... all thanks to Mirja-san and everyone.  
**Kiyoka:** I used to be useless and scared of aradama, but I only grew past it thanks to the investigation team.  
**Fate:** ...Did you find it hard fighting against someone who looked the same as this Mirja person?  
**Kiyoka:** If I'm honest... A little.  
**Yomi:** Musumi-san, Harlaown-san. There's someone giving orders to the mimic aradama to take Akabane swords.  
**Yomi:** I'm going to report to the Sword Administration Bureau, so please wait a moment.  
**Kiyoka:** Alright.  
**Fate:** I'll pass this on to Nanoha and Hayate too.  
**Kiyoka:** Huh, so you have magic that works like a phone too.  
**Fate:** We do.  
**Fate:** (This is Fate. ...Nanoha, Hayate, can you hear me?)  

## 5: A Hard Fought Battle
**Fate:** (This is Fate. ...Nanoha, Hayate, can you hear me?)  
**Hayate:** (Hayate here! ...Sorry, Fate-chan! In the middle of a fight right now!)  
**Yume Mimic:** Aha!  
**Yume Mimic:** Sayaka-chan's tough alright! But... can you handle this!?  
**Sayaka:** Kh...  
**Yume Mimic:** Ahahaha! That's not the best you've got, right, Sayaka-chan! Do it better than that!  
**Hayate:** Sayaka-san!!  
**Sayaka:** ......I'm fine. You support Suu, Hayate.  
**Hayate:** ...Okay!  
**Hayate:** (Suu-san is...)  
**Suu:** YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!  
**Mimic Aradama:** GUOOOOO!  
**Suuu:** It's not down yet!?  
**Mimic Aradama:** OOOOOOOOO!!  
**Hayate:** I'll back you up, Suu-san!  
**Suu:** Thanks, Hayate-chan!  
**Suu:** HAHH!!  
**Suu:** [pant pant]...  
**Hokuto Mimic:** ...  
**Suu:** --!? There's an aradama mimicking Hokuto-san!?  
**Hokuto Mimic:** ...!  
**Suu:** Aaah!?  
**Hokuto Mimic:** ...!  
**Suu:** Gh!  
**Suu:** (My utsushi... This is the sixth time...)  
**Suu:** But, for just this aradama... Don't you dare... COPY HOKUTO-SAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN!!  
**Suu:** [pant pant]...  
**Suu:** Just how many of them are there...?  
**Suu:** (What do we do; I'll get beaten at this rate... For Sayaka-san to help me, she'll have to...)  
**Yume Mimic:** Aha! Ahahaha!  
**Sayaka:** --!  
**Suu:** (...She doesn't have the room to be helping me. What now... I'm holding us back.)  
**Hayate:** Are you okay, Suu-san?  
**Suu:** ...Honestly, we might be in a pinch here.  
**Hayate:** Sorry, I wish I could back you up a little better...  
**Hayate:** I'm no good with magic that takes fine control...  
**Suu:** Sure... Wait, fine control? Does that mean you're good at magic you don't have to control?  
**Hayate:** That's how it goes.  
**Hayate:** But, if I used that, you'd get caught up in it.  
**Suu:** Then, let's go with that!  
**Hayate:** With that?  
**Suu:** Yeah! I'm just guessing, but I can probably use utsushi two or three more times... So getting hit with friendly fire's no problem!  
**Hayate:** ...Are you okay with that?  
**Suu:** Of course I'm not okay with it!  
**Suu:** But... It's not just you, Hayate-chan... Nanoha-chan and Fate-chan too. All these girls even younger than me are trying so hard.  
**Suu:** Me being the only one looking pathetic... I'd hate that even more here.  
**Suu:** So... I'll be the bait, so fire away!  
**Hayate:** Just one thing... You're not thinking of sacrificing yourself, are you?  
**Suu:** I haven't thought that for a second!  
**Hayate:** ...Then, let's do it.  
**Hayate:** I'm counting on you to round them up, Suu-san!  
**Suu:** Just watch me! If you're only looking for the best punching bag, I'm the number one toji!  
**Suu:** Please make it quick, while I still have utsushi up!  
**Hayate:** Got it. Yagami Hayate! Hitting you with a big one!  
**Hayate:** GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!  
**Yume Mimic:** Uwah!? What was that!?  
**Sayaka:** Suu! Hayate!  
**Hayate:** I'm just fine. Suu-san is...  
**Suu:** ...I'm okay!  
**Suu:** The aradama went down... Yep! The punching bag strategy worked perfect!  
**Suu:** Hayate-chan! Leave the mimic aradama to me, and go back up Sayaka-san!  
**Hayate:** Okay!  
**Sayaka:** Now it's two on one.  
**Yume Mimic:** Awww, just when it was getting fun, you had to come and ruin it.  
**Yume Mimic:** Weaklings always bunch right up.  
**Hayate:** Sayaka-san!  
**Sayaka:** Mm!  
**Sayaka:** HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!  
**Nanoha:** Yeah, Fate-chan, Hayate-chan. Wait... Ah.  
**Nanoha:** Raising Heart says it's done getting it ready!  
**Nanoha:** We're waiting for you!  
**Kanami:** Since you're not holding a phone, was that magic just now?  
**Nanoha:** Yes, Kanami-san.  
**Nanoha:** It sounds like Fate-chan and Hayate-chan succeeded in getting the Akabane swords, so they're coming our way now!  
**Kanami:** You said something about something being ready...?  
**Nanoha:** Right! It's our ace up our sleeve!  
**Fate:** Nanoha-!  
**Hayate:** Heeey!  
**Nanoha:** Fate-chan! Hayate-chan!  
**Kanami:** Satsuki-san, what do we do from here?  
**Yomi:** We're going to the location where Ban-san and the other fake toji announced they would be taking the Akabane swords for testing.  
**Kiyoka:** ...What if it's a trap?  
**Yomi:** It's possible, but we have no other leads.   
**Sayaka:** Understood.  
**Suu:** About that... I'm going to have to quit here.  
**Kanami:** Suu-chan!?  
**Suu:** I only have one or two uses of utsushi left. If I went along like this, all I'd be doing is holding you back...  
**Suu:** So anyway, I'm leaving the rest to you, Hayate-chan.  
**Hayate:** Okay! You can count on me, Suu-san!  
**Yomi:** ...  
**Yomi:** ...Etou-san, can I leave you in charge of the rest?  
**Kanami:** The rest?  
**Yomi:** Someone needs to guard the Akabane swords and Inami-san. Could I ask you to go on in my place?  
**Kanami:** ...I got it. Let's go, everybody!  
**Suu:** They're gone now.  
**Yomi:** With Etou-san and the others, it'll go fine.  
**Suu:** You're probably right...  
**Suu:** Thanks for staying behind for my sake, Satsuki-san.  
**Suu:** ...  
**Suu:** Aghh, it's kind of frustrating... If I were just a little bit stronger...  
**Yomi:** Then, let's intensify your utsushi increasing program.  
**Suu:** Huh?  

## 6: Our Magic
**Kanami:** This should be the place they were going, but...  
**???:** ...So there are shrewd ones among toji.  
**Kiyoka:** Eh!? What's Suruga doing here!?  
**Suruga?:** Hoh. You've met with one who looks the same as myself? Yet, that one and I are different beings.  
**Sayaka:** What were you doing with the Akabane swords?  
**Suruga?:** What? Merely to take your place.  
**Sayaka:** Take our place?  
**Suruga?:** We attained toji. Then we would need okatana, would we not?  
**Kanami:** Aradama taking the place of toji...?  
**Suruga?:** There are those among my kin who can mimic humans capable of polishing Akabane swords.  
**Suruga?:** Being which, would it not be amusing to wipe out the human toji and take their place?  
**Kiyoka:** Aradama becoming toji, that's crazy...  
**Sayaka:** It's not amusing.  
**Kanami:** We aren't about to let you!  
**Hayate:** You said it, Kanami-san!  
**Fate:** If you replacing the toji means countless people have to be your victims, then we'll put a stop to it.  
**Nanoha:** That's what our magic is for!  
**Suruga?:** End your barking, girl. What can one who is not a toji do?  
**Kanami:**　More mimic aradama!? Get back, Nanoha-chan, Fate-chan, Hayate-chan!  
**Nanoha:** There's no need! Even if normal magic won't work on them, it's not like we can't still fight!  
**Fate:** We found a way to fight!  
**Hayate:** Showing for the first time here! Special anti-aradama magic!  
**Nanoha:** Hayate-chan! Fate-chan! Let's go all at once!  
**Fate:** Okay!  
**Hayate:** On it!  
**Nanoha:** React Annihilation Magic, Eraser Application!  
**Magical Girls:** BLAST SHOOT!  
**Suruga?:** Wha...  
**Kanami:** That's amazing, Nanoha-chan!  
**Suruga?:** With one shot, my kin were... Amusing. I must respond in kind.  
**Kanami:** There's so many aradama... But, if we have Nanoha and them helping us!  
**Nanoha:** Right! Kanami-san! There's no way we'll lose!  
**Suruga?:** Then struggle to your last. I will offer as many as you need.  
**Sayaka:** --!!  
**Fate:** HAAAAHH!!  
**Sayaka:** ...You really are fast, Fate. It's hard keeping up even with jin'i.  
**Fate:** But you are keeping up with me, Sayaka-san.  
**Sayaka:** You can go even faster.  
**Fate:** I'll give all I have!  
**Sayaka:** Me too!  
**Hayate:** Ooh. Fate-chan and Sayaka-san sure are something. I can't go letting them show me up.  
**Hayate:** Claíomh Solais!  
**Hayate:** Alright!  
**Mimic Aradama:** OOOOOOOOO!!  
**Kiyoka:** Look out, Hayate-chan!  
**Hayate:** Thanks, Kiyoka-san.  
**Kiyoka:** Oh, it's nothing.  
**Kiyoka:** I'll keep you safe, Hayate-chan, so just keep going!  
**Hayate:** Sure! Leave it to me!  
**Nanoha:**  Purge Shooter!  
**Nanoha:** ...No matter how many we beat, more keep on coming out.  
**Nanoha:** (Everyone's trying their hardest, but, at this rate...)  
**Nanoha:** Kanami-san!  
**Kanami:** HAAAAAAAAA!!  
**Kanami:** What is it, Nanoha-chan?  
**Nanoha:** I'll open up a path for you. So... Can I ask you to handle the rest?  
**Kanami:** Got it, Nanoha-chan. I'll cut her down and exorcise her.  
**Nanoha:** Please do, Kanami-san!  
**Nanoha:** Raising Heart!  
**Raising Heart:** All right.  
**Nanoha:** Mana Convergence! Soul... BREAKER!!  
**Suruga?:** Whah!?  
**Suruga?:** What is that power...! Kh...!  
**Suruga?:** Even guarding against it, I was pushed this far... Though, that wasn't enough to destroy me.  
**Kanami:** YAAH!!  
**Suruga?:** Kgh!?  
**Kanami:** I'm not giving you enough time to call more mimic aradama!  
**Suruga?:** A toji caught up with me...!?  
**Kanami:** The time Nanoha-chan bought for me! I'm not letting it go to waste!   
**Kanami:** HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!  
**Suruga:** Gh...  
**Kanami:** ...Did that do it?  
**Suruga?:** I enjoyed this, toji...  
**Kiyoka:** Etou-san! The mimic aradama went away, but... What about Suruga!?  
**Kanami:** Yeah, looks like I exorcised her.  
**Kanami:** And that was all because of you, Nanoha-chan. Thanks.  
**Nanoha:** I'm just glad we could defeat them before they could cause any major damage!  
**Sayaka:** Your magic was beautiful, Fate.  
**Fate:** Thank you, Sayaka-san. You were incredible too.  
**Kiyoka:** Hayate-chan, did you get hurt anywhere?  
**Hayate:** Nope, I'm fine. Thanks though.  
**Kiyoka:** Alright. I'm glad I managed to protect you...  
**Kanami:** Thanks a lot, really, Nanoha-chan, Fate-chan, Hayate-chan.  
**Magical Girls:** Sure thing!  

## 1: I'm Not Lettin' That Go
**Yomi:** ...There are no longer signs of aradama in this location either. Takamachi-san, was there anything you found suspicious?  
**Nanoha:** No, it looks alright to me.  
**Tsugumi:** Okay, we're done here-. "No issues in this location either", there.  
**Nanoha:** Uh...  
**Nanoha:** Th-That's right, Tsugumi-san...  
**Tsugumi:** What's wrong, Takamachi-san?  
**Nanoha:** Actually, this is the place where I fought your mimic aradama with Kanami-san...  
**Tsugumi:** Is that what happened?  
**Tsugumi:** Even if it was just like me, an aradama is an aradama. Don't let it bother you.  
**Nanoha:** I know that, but, it really was just like you...  
**Tsugumi:** Did it resemble me that closely? Hmm, I would like to have been there then. What a shame.  
**Yomi:** ...Let's put an end to this conversation and head back. Sanae-san and Harlaown-san, and Akira and Yagami-san, should be returning from investigating the other locations now.  
**Akira:** Yomi! What's the deal with this brat!  
**Yomi:** Akira?  
**Fate:** Did you do something with Akira-san, Hayate?  
**Hayate:** Y'see, Akira-san looks like she's really packing, so I just wanted to see if I could check...  
**Akira:** No shit I wasn't gonna let you!  
**Hayate:** And it went like this.  
**Fate:** Ahaha...  
**Sanae:** Satsuki-san. About the location I went to with Fate-san, there were no signs of aradama there.  
**Sanae:** It didn't seem like Fate-san was able to pick up anything especially strange there either.  
**Yomi:** Understood. What about you, Akira?  
**Akira:** ...Tch. It was the same for us; there's nothing there.  
**Fate:** Hm? By the way... What happened to Nanoha? Wasn't she with you two, Yomi-san, Tsugumi-san?  
**Tsugumi:** Takamachi-san should be back any minute. She was going to get something...  
**Nanoha:** Ah, you already met up! Welcome back, Fate-chan, Hayate-chan.  
**Nanoha:** ...Though, is it weird for me to say that when I'm the last one here?  
**Fate:** Probably.  
**Fate:** Welcome back, Nanoha.  
**Nanoha:** Yeah. I'm back, Fate-chan.  
**Hayate:** Tsugumi-san said you were getting something, so I guess that's it.  
**Nanoha:** Yep!  
**Nanoha:** Um, I wanted to offer you cakes! Let's all eat them together!  
**Tsugumi:** Cakes?  
**Tsugumi:** ...They looks delicious.  
**Sanae:** I know. And so adorable too. Since you went and got them for us, I'll have one...  
**Sanae:** Ah, it's tasty.  
**Akira:** ...  
**Yomi:** Aren't you going to eat, Akira? You...  
**Akira:** Shut up, Yomi.  
**Yomi:** ...  
**Akira:** (Damnit, there's no way I could eat cakes that look this cute!)  
**Akira:** (But it'd be such a waste if I don't... Okay. How do I go about eating one?)  
**Akira:** (Ahh, crap. I can't stop smiling.)  
**Nanoha:** ...Um, Akira-san. Do you maybe not like cake?  
**Akira:** Huh?  
**Yomi:** No, Akira...  
**Akira:** Didn't I tell you to shut it!  
**Yomi:** ...  
**Akira:** ...It's not like I hate it. It's just, sorta... y'know.  
**Nanoha:** ?  
**Fate:** What's the matter?  
**Hayate:** ...Ah.  
**Hayate:** We weren't together all that long, but I can tell Akira-san's trying to look cool.  
**Fate:** She wants to look cool?  
**Yume:** Ah-! You look like you're eating something yummy! Lucky-! Gimme some!  
**Yomi:** Do you want to have mine?  
**Yume:** You already ate half of yours, Yomi-onee-san. So if that onee-san's not gonna have hers, I'll take it-.  
**Akira:** Huh? What're you talking about...  
**Yume:** You're the only one who doesn't look like she's gonna eat, so it's fine, right?  
**Akira:** Hahh!?  
**Yume:** [om nom]... Mm, so good!  
**Akira:** A-Ahh......  
**Akira:** ...You're gonna pay for that.  
**Akira:** I'm not letting this one go.  
**Akira:** I'm gonna teach you a lesson, Tsubakuro Yume!  
**Yume:** Ehh!?  
**Yomi:** (...Because Akira loves cakes.)  

## 2: Playing Tag
**Akira:** Let's take this outside, Tsubakuro Yume!  
**Yume:** ...Aha.  
**Yume:** That means we're going to fight, right? You sure?  
**Akira:** Hah?  
**Yume:** Onee-san, you know you're going to lose?  
**Akira:** Come try me then!  
**Sanae:** Hold on a minute! Don't you think that's going too far over a piece of cake!  
**Akira:** Doesn't matter how big or small what she did is, Sanae.  
**Akira:** The point is, she did something she shouldn't. So I'm gonna teach her a lesson.  
**Akira:** That's all there is to it. You get that, right?  
**Yume:** I don't really get what lesson you're going to teach me, but this seems fun so I'm fine with it.  
**Sanae:** Just hang on a minute!  
**Sanae:** Here, look! See how troubled you're making Takamachi-san after she brought the cake for us!  
**Nanoha:** Uhh...  
**Akira:** That's... Well, I guess you've got a point.  
**Yume:** Ah! I know about this cause I made sure to read the report!  
**Yume:** Nanoha-chan, Fate-chan, Hayate-chan. You're all really strong, right?  
**Fate:** She's looking at us like she wants to fight us... isn't she.  
**Hayate:** (You're probably wanting to fight yourself though, Fate-chan...  
**Hayate:** What are you going to do, Fate-chan?  
**Fate:** ...I think I'm interested.  
**Hayate:** Okay, in that case...  
**Hayate:** (Hey, Nanoha-chan, Fate-chan.)  
**Nanoha:** (What is it, Hayate-chan?)  
**Fate:** (What do you have in mind?)  
**Hayate:** (What do you think of this? See...)  
**Hayate:** (Something like that.)  
**Nanoha:** (Good thinking, Hayate-chan! That's a nice idea!)  
**Fate:** (Yeah, let's go with that.)  
**Hayate:** (Then it's settled.)  
**Hayate:** Anyway, if that's how it is, what do you say we decide this with a game of tag?  
**Akira/Yume:** Tag?  
**Hayate:** Alright, so I'll explain the rules.  
**Hayate:** It's pretty simple.  
**Hayate:** We'll split into two teams: Nanoha-chan, Yume-san, and Tsugumi-san, and Akira-san, Sanae-san, and me. First team to catch Fate-chan, who's it, wins.  
**Hayate:** Fate-chan's gonna run with all she's got, so do all you can to get her!  
**Yume:** If we can do all we can, that means we can fight, right?  
**Hayate:** Sure. Fate-chan's tough.  
**Yume:** Hmm, sounds neat. I'll be fighting Fate-chan, so you two can just watch.  
**Nanoha:** Is that really going to be okay...?  
**Tsugumi:** Tsubakuro-san says it's fine, so there shouldn't be an issue.  
**Tsugumi:** I suppose our job is just at the start then-.  
**Nanoha:** At the start?  
**Tsugumi:** [whisper whisper whisper]  
**Nanoha:** Ehhh!?  
**Hayate:** That team looks like they're having fun. Let's give it our best shot too!  
**Akira:** I'm uh, sorry this turned into a whole thing. This all wouldn'tve happened if I'd just eaten the cake straight away.  
**Sanae:** Maybe that's true, but Tsubakuro-san is also at fault for taking it from you.  
**Sanae:** Let's try to win, Inago-san.  
**Akira:** Yeah, glad to have you, Sanae, Hayate!  
**Hayate:** We're counting on you as the referee, Yomi-san.  
**Yomi:** Understood.  
**Yomi:** Is everyone ready? Then... Please begin.  
**Tsugumi:** Takamachi-san, if you would.  
**Nanoha:** Is this really okay... Uhh, I'm sorry for this! Bind!  
**Akira:** The hell is this!? I can't move!!  
**Yume:** Ahaha! That's so cool!  
**Tsugumi:** Now then, we'll be going on ahead-.  
**Nanoha:**　Bind will come undone soon! Sorry!  
**Hayate:** Nnn, that's Nanoha-chan for you. She got us...  
**Sanae:** Isn't there anything we can do about this?  
**Hayate:** Nanoha-chan said it'd come undone soon, so I think we're better off waiting.  
**Hayate:** In the meantime, we can talk strategy.  
**Sanae:** Okay, that would make the best of our time.  
**Sanae:** More than likely, Tsubakuro-san and them are probably going to find Harlaown-san first.  
**Sanae:** Taking on both Harlaown-san and Tsubakuro-san... It'll be a little difficult, Inago-san.  
**Akira:** The question's, how can we hold down Yume. If we can take her out of the picture, we can figure out the rest...  
**Akira:** Wait, they've got Nanoha with 'em.  
**Hayate:** You can just leave Nanoha-chan to me.  
**Akira:** Then that makes what comes after simple. We rush 'em when they're fighting Fate, and me and Sanae take out Tsugumi first.  
**Akira:** Then, we take on Yume like that. If it's 2 on 1 we should be able to manage.  
**Sanae:** ...You're right that that seem like our best chance of winning...  
**Akira:** You don't like it?  
**Sanae:** ...Kind of. If only I could stop Tsubakuro-san by myself, then you could focus on Harlaown-san, Inago-san...  
**Akira:** Tsubakuro Yume's tough. I don't even know how well I could do going at her on my own.  
**Akira:** That's why this is our best bet.  
**Sanae:** ...Okay.  
**Hayate:** Akira-san, you make yourself look like a delinquent, but you really are a nice person, huh.  
**Akira:** Shaddup. I just like this kinda fashion is all.  
**Hayate:** You've got such a nice figure though. I bet you'd look good whatever you wear, so, why do you go with that?  
**Akira:** No real reason. Just, somebody I looked up to used to dress like this.  
**Akira:** ...Anyway, I can start moving around now. C'mon, let's go.  
**Sanae/Hayate:** Alright!  
**Yume:** Found you, Fate-chan! You two, don't get in our way!  
**Tsugumi:** I know-.  
**Nanoha:** Try your best, Yume-san.  
**Yume:** Aha!  
**Yume:** Okay then... Let's go, Fate-chan!  
**Fate:** --!?  
**Fate:** Sayaka-chan was fast, but... You're quick too, Yume-san!  
**Yume:** You fought with Sayaka-chan?  
**Fate:** With Sayaka-san and Kanami-san.  
**Yume:** Huh!  
**Fate:** They were both very strong.  
**Yume:** Then, I've gotta let you know that I'm even stronger!  
**Fate:** --!?  
**Nanoha:**  Yume-chan, she's incredible... For the first time, someone's matching Fate-chan's speed...  
**Tsugumi:** Tsubakuro-san is a special case, after all.  
**Tsugumi:** Though... If Harlaown-san is evenly matched with Tsubakuro-san, she must be someone special as well.  
**Nanoha:** Fate-chan is strong too.  
**Tsugumi:** You sure do have faith in her-.  
**Tsugumi:** Though, will you help support Tsubakuro-san now?  
**Nanoha:** Sure!  
**Yume:** Ahahaha! Is that all you've got, Fate-chan?  
**Fate:** I can handle this. I can... get more serious!  
**Akira:** Tch, they're already going at it. Though... We finally caught up!  

## 3: Are You a Sly Dog or What?
**Akira:** Tch, they're already going at it. Though... We finally caught up!  
**Tsugumi:** Oh, you came much faster than I was expecting.  
**Akira:** Oi oi, you got this much free time on your hands!  
**Tsugumi:** That's not exactly it...  
**Akira:** Let's go, Tsugumi! ORAA!  
**Tsugumi:** ...!?  
**Nanoha:** Watch out!  
**Hayate:**　Not gonna let you, Nanoha-chan!  
**Nanoha:** Hayate-chan!?  
**Hayate:** I'll be your opponent here!  
**Akira:** Alright! You keep Nanoha company, Hayate!  
**Akira:** Sanae!  
**Tsugumi:** So it came down to this... It'll be very hard fighting the both of you though...!?  
**Akira:** Try and see how long you can last!  
**Tsugumi:** ...I'll try and last!!  
**Sanae:** HAAAAAAAAAA!!  
**Tsugumi:** ......!!  
**Tsugumi:** ...Ahh, you got me-. Well, there's no way I could stand up to that-.  
**Sanae:** Don't think too badly of us, Ban-san. This is just part of the game.  
**Sanae:** Inago-san! At this rate, Tsubakuro-san will...  
**Akira:** ...  
**Sanae:** Inago-san?  
**Akira:** Just take a look at that.  
**Yume:** Ahahaha! This is fun, huh, Fate-chan!  
**Fate:** Yes... I'm having fun, Yume-san!  
**Akira:** ......Tch.  
**Akira:** Sorry for this, after we went and thought up our strategy. There's no way for us to break into that one-on-one.  
**Sanae:** ...That's for sure.  
**Hayate:** You sure do look after others a lot, Akira-san.  
**Akira:** Oh hey, Hayate. You beat Nanoha already?  
**Hayate:** You looked like you were giving up on fighting, so we called a time out.  
**Akira:** Time out...? Well, whatever. You can put an end to that too.  
**Akira:** Let's just wait till these two are done fighting.  
**Hayate:** Okaaay.  
**Tsugumi:** ...Doesn't this mean I'm the only one who got beat up-?  
**Nanoha:** Ahaha...  
**Yume:** Ahh, that was so fun. Let's do it again, Fate-chan.  
**Fate:** I'd be happy to do it anytime, Yume-san.  
**Yume:** Great!  
**Yume:** ...Wait, huh? What're you onee-sans doing?  
**Akira:** Waiting on you two to finish up your fight. Damnit, you took long enough my head cooled off.  
**Yume:** What does that mean?  
**Akira:** I'm saying the stuff with the cake is water under the bridge.  
**Yume:** Water under the bridge? I'm the one who fought Fate-chan first, so doesn't that make me the winner?  
**Akira:** Huh?  
**Akira:** ...Whatever, we're past that now.  
**Hayate:** Mmhm, Akira-san's a big sister type; a real good girl.  
**Akira:** Oi, who're you calling a good girl? You're younger than me.  
**Hayate:** A good girl is a good girl.  
**Hayate:** And... For being such a good girl, I have a present for you.  
**Yomi:** It seems the fighting is over.  
**Akira:** Yomi?  
**Akira:** Oh yeah, weren't you the ref? Where'd you go?  
**Yomi:** I went to get this, at Yagami-san's request.  
**Yomi:** It's fresh cake. Isn't that nice, Akira.  
**Akira:** ...What the hell.  
**Akira:** If you got more cake, there wasn't any point in playing tag, was there?  
**Hayate:** We got to have a bit of fun though. It was fun, right?  
**Akira:** ...Yeah it was. Feels like we're all buddies now.  
**Akira:** So anyway, since there's more, let's head back and have some cake.  
**Yume:** Sweet! Cake!  
**Akira:** Hah?  
**Nanoha:** Don't worry, Akira-san! We made sure to get enough for Yume-san too this time!  
**Akira:** You did? Geez, who put you up to that... Wait, it was you, wasn't it?  
**Akira:** How long ago'd you think this up?  
**Hayate:** When we offered to play tag. Cake was what got you two fighting, so cake would help you make up.  
**Akira:** I can't go taking my eyes off you, huh.  
**Hayate:** Thank you very much.  
**Akira:** That wasn't meant to be a compliment...  
**Yume:** What kind of cake do you like, Fate-chan?  
**Fate:** I like... I like any cake.  
**Akira:** Well, whatever.
