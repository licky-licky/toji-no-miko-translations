Hey, can&#x27;t we all go to some hot springs together?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> That sounds nice, hot springs. We&#x27;ve been working nonstop lately, so a chance to let our hair down would be much appreciated.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> There&#x27;s no way all four of us can take a trip at once. Who&#x27;s going to guard Yukari-sama then?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I know that. It&#x27;s only wishful thinking. You take everything so seriously, Maki-san.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Oh, you weren&#x27;t serious? ...Still, it would be good if we could visit hot springs together.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> What if we say it&#x27;s for an elite guard training camp? Then Yukari-sama will take us and we can all go to the hot springs! Like in Hakone!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> That&#x27;s an unrealistic plan.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> ...Wait? Didn&#x27;t all four of us go to a hot spring in Hakone before?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> We did. If I remember right, it was around when the elite guard was still being formed, shortly after Yume joined.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Back then we were elite guard in name only. We weren&#x27;t used to each other yet, so it was disgraceful the way we struggled with each other.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Especially on that day. Just thinking about it makes my cheeks burn red.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Though it&#x27;s thanks to that incident that we began mutually respecting each other&#x27;s ability--  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="2-in-the-past-aradama-eradication-operation"></a>2: In the Past: Aradama Eradication Operation<a class="hash-link" href="#2-in-the-past-aradama-eradication-operation" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Yukari:</strong> --Maki, Suzuka. This time, I&#x27;ll have you two aid in an operation to eliminate aradama located in Hakone.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> The scale of this operation will be greater than anything you two have been assigned since the formation of the elite guard.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> To that end, I&#x27;ve arranged for many toji to be under your command. All the equipment and rations you should need have been prepared as well.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Thank you for trusting me with such an important mission.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I&#x27;ll see to it that this operation is carried out without fail.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> --So then, Maki-san. Were you planning on leading the charge again?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Of course. Having the captain at the front allows you to react and give orders as fast as possible.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Is that so. However, it&#x27;s my opinion that a captain should stay behind the unit, to get the clearest picture looking after the whole group.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> But my unit suffers less injuries compared to others. The numbers don&#x27;t lie.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> That they don&#x27;t. Then this time, I suppose I&#x27;ll have to stick close to you and study how you fight.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I might even learn the secret behind your strength for myself, Maki-san.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Do whatever you want. Let&#x27;s go, there&#x27;s aradama to cut down! --Haah!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> As I&#x27;ve come to expect, you handle your sword well, Maki-san.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> ---! There&#x27;s one coming around behind you! I&#x27;ll dispose of it! Haaaah!!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> -!? Suzuka, you&#x27;re too close!! Give me more room to fight!!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I almost hit you when I swung at that aradama!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> What&#x27;s with your attitude!? I moved in to save you, you know!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I didn&#x27;t need your help! Worry about yourself instead of me!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...!! Is that so!! Then the next time you&#x27;re in a pinch, Maki-san, I&#x27;ll look the other way!!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Good! That works for me!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Honestly, what is with you...! ...Forget it. I&#x27;ll return to the rear of the unit, like usual--<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...Eh-!?  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="3-army-of-aradama"></a>3: Army of Aradama<a class="hash-link" href="#3-army-of-aradama" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Suzuka:</strong> We&#x27;ve been completely surrounded by aradama! Just where did they all come from...!?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> They can&#x27;t have been lying in wait for us, can they...?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> It&#x27;s just a coincidence. Aradama setting up an ambush is unheard of.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...You&#x27;re right, I&#x27;m overthinking it. Aradama don&#x27;t have the intelligence for it, after all.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Still, this is bad. We&#x27;ve been separated from the rest of the group.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> We need to hurry and regroup--<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Still, against these numbers, reuniting with them won&#x27;t be easy.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> We need to come up with a plan. But with their attacks coming one after another, it&#x27;s hard getting a grip on the situation--  </p><p>Approximately six hours after Maki and Suzuka were separated from the rest of the unit.</p><p><strong>Commander A:</strong> What&#x27;s going on out there!? The amount of aradama hasn&#x27;t decreased in the slightest!<br>
<strong>Commander B:</strong> Are Shidou-san and Konohana-san still unaccounted for!?<br>
<strong>Commander C:</strong> I don&#x27;t care how big the operation was supposed to be, how can you lose track of two of our top toji like that...!!<br>
<strong>Commander D:</strong> This shouldn&#x27;t be possible...!! There&#x27;s no record of anything like this happening...!!<br>
<strong>Commander E:</strong> The toji on site are asking for instructions! Can anyone deal with them--<br>
<strong>Commander B:</strong> What do you want us to say!? Tell them to act at their own discretion!<br>
<strong>Watanuki Kazumi:</strong> --I&#x27;ve heard that Maki-sama and Suzuka-sama were separated from their unit, but how did this happen!?<br>
<strong>Commander F:</strong> Those two were fighting in the vanguard, when a sudden swarm of aradama overwhelmed them.<br>
<strong>Commander F:</strong> Their current whereabouts are unknown. The numbers of aradama in the area are too great to conduct a search.<br>
<strong>Naeba Wakako:</strong> For both captains to have been isolated by a swarm of aradama, isn&#x27;t this a complete disaster...!?<br>
<strong>Kazumi:</strong> It&#x27;s been six hours already since they began fighting. We need to re-establish contact immediately to get them out of this war of attrition.<br>
<strong>Kazumi:</strong> Have the toji on site form a rescue party, and search from where those two--<br>
<strong>Commander F:</strong> On top of the immense numbers of aradama in the area, none of the other toji have experience commanding a unit. They have their hands full just keeping themselves safe.<br>
<strong>Commander F:</strong> Given their circumstances, they don&#x27;t have the toji to spare separating into a rescue party.<br>
<strong>Kazumi:</strong> You can&#x27;t be serious... Then you plan on leaving Maki-sama out there to die...!?<br>
<strong>Commander F:</strong> I-I didn&#x27;t say that... It&#x27;s just, we have no other options to work with.<br>
<strong>Wakako:</strong> So you&#x27;re praying for a miracle that the aradama are dealt with before it&#x27;s too late...?<br>
<strong>???:</strong> Don&#x27;t waste your breath on prayer. Miracles are something we must make for ourselves.<br>

<strong>Yukari:</strong> --In regards to Maki and Suzuka, I&#x27;ve already formed a rescue party. I will be taking command from here.<br>
