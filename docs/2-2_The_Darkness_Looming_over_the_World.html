It won't be long now before we arrive at Aoto-kan.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I still can't believe it. I never would have guessed Youji-san was helping Mokusa like Chii-nee.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> If that's how it was, you should have just told us when we went there the first time.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Their organization is supposed to be a secret, so I don't think they could have...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ahh- Oh yeah! It was, wasn't it? Ahaha.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Aren't you upset about it, Mihono-chan, Kiyoka-chan? After I lied to you and used you.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Hmm~, I don't feel mad about it though?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> ...Why not?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Why not...? Well I never even noticed, so I wouldn't have found out unless you told me.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Wouldn't it be weirder if I got mad about something I didn't know? In fact, it's more like I think it's pretty cool how you managed to keep all that a secret, Chii-nee~.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> As for me... I know you're a good person, Setouchi-san. If someone like you has to tell a lie, I'm sure you're doing it for a good reason...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That's why I won't really... I won't hold it against you!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> And what if being a good person was just another part of my act?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Even then, I wouldn't mind... Even if you were acting, the fact remains that you were so kind to me... That's enough for me.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> You two... Thanks.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> C'mon, quit worrying about it already! You're such a downer, Chii-nee~. Besides, everyone's got a secret or two they haven't told anybody, right?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Like, don't tell her, but my stomach was rumbling earlier and I couldn't help myself, so I ate Fukki's pudding.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Ohhh~? So you were behind that, huh?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Geh, Fukki-!? You heard that!?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> "Geh... You heard that", so that's how it is now!?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> When I asked you about it before, you said you had no clue what happened to my pudding. Why didn't you say something? Why the hell didn't you say something~?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I-I tried to tell you! But you looked like you were about to stab someone! Your eyes were really scary, so I just...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Well course I did. When you steal the pudding somebody was really looking forward to, you should expect to get what's coming to you!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I-I'm so sorry! I'll buy you two puddings as payback, so forgive me!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Three. If that's too much, then we can do this the really hard way.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ughh~... Fine... If that gets me off the hook... I'll buy you three puddings.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Heh, you get to live another day. And make sure you don't forget this one. People hold serious grudges when you eat what's theirs!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> G-Got iiit...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Aghh~... Talk about false charges.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I don't think you get to call that false charges, Hono-chan.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ch-Changing the subject! When we were here last time, it was pretty crazy with all the aradama around, wasn't it!<br><em>aradama appears</em></p><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah, just like that- Whoa, it's happening again!!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I-It's because you had to go and bring it up, Hono-chan...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Eh!? This is my fault now!?  </p><h2 id="2-harajuku-revisited-2" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>2: Harajuku Revisited (2)</h2><p><strong>Chie:</strong> Why does this have to keep happening when we're in such a rush...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Well I've always got time for aradama-chan! Hehaha!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> We're losing too much time to these aradama. Let's pick up the pace to Aoto-kan.  </p><h2 id="3-feeling-rushed-getting-impatient-1" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>3: Feeling Rushed, Getting Impatient (1)</h2><p><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I never would have thought we'd be fighting aradama as soon as we arrived in Harajuku...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Same here. I wish they'd do us a favor for once and leave us alone.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> You said it.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Huh? Am I hearing things!? You're always pumped up whenever there's a chance to fight aradama, so why not now?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> It's hard to get into it when Chichie won't stop looking so depressing.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> .........<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Chii-nee? Chii-nee!?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> ...Eh? W-What is it? Sorry, I didn't hear you.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> It's nothing, just... Are you okay?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Mmhm... Of course.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Are you now? Because it very much doesn't seem that way to me.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Your reactions are more sluggish than ever before, on top of which you're having a hard time assessing the situation, paying attention to your surroundings, and listening to others.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Do you realize how many times you've put yourself at risk while we've been fighting now? Thankfully, Asakura Mihono and Musumi Kiyoka have been there to cover for you.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I understand that Mokusa is weighing on your mind, but it's inexcusable for you to ignore the situation at hand.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Rather than helping, you're only a burden on us like this. Frankly, it would only save us trouble if you would stay out of the fighting.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Th-That's going too far...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> What's your prob--<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> GYAAAUUUU!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ehh, there's more!?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> One after another... We don't have time for this!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Everyone, prepare for battle. Shichinosato Kofuki will attack the enemy from the front. Setouchi Chie and Musumi Kiyoka will support from the rear. Asakura Mihono and I will attack at their blind spots, until all of them are eliminated.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> We need to finish this fast so I can find out what happened to the others. I'm joining the front!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I hope you haven't forgotten, but I'm the captain of this investigation team.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> And, as captain, I'm rejecting that proposal. With the way you are now, you'd only be slowing us down unnecessarily.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Musumi Kiyoka. Please make sure Setouchi Chie doesn't overwork herself.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I-I'll try.  </p><h2 id="4-feeling-rushed-getting-impatient-2" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>4: Feeling Rushed, Getting Impatient (2)</h2><p><strong>Mirja:</strong> Pant, pant, pant...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> M-Mirja-san, your arm is bleeding...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> It's nothing. It isn't deep enough to affect my ability to fight.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> You overdid it. For all that lecturing you were giving Chichie, you're not acting like yourself either.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Seriously. I had that sinking feeling in my stomach the whole time you kept pushing forward after your utsushi broke.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I only did what I decided had to be done. We're in a race against time. We can't afford to be held back here.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> ...You mean, you got hurt because of me?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> That isn't the case. I was only injured due to my own inexperience. I should be more dedicated to my training.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> I'm sorry... About earlier.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> So long as you understand, that's enough.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I'm aware you're feeling rushed, but because of that you were exposing all of us to danger. I know you don't want that either.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Achieving our goal is meaningless if we can't reach it while guaranteeing everyone's safety.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Naturally that means keeping you safe as well, Setouchi Chie.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> In the same way you are worried about Mokusa, I am worried about you.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Mirja-san... Thank you.  </p><h2 id="5-what-happens-twice-will-happen-thrice-1" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>5: What Happens Twice Will Happen Thrice (1)</h2><p><strong>Mirja:</strong> Now that we've all managed to catch our breath, let's--<br><strong>Girl:</strong> KYAAAAAAA!!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Wh-What was that!? Eh... N-No way... More aradama...!? They're after her!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> You're kidding, aradama again!? They say what happens twice happens thrice, but now of all times... Come onnn~!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> You guys go on ahead and leave this to me.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> This is a real emergency, you know! Don't try to look cool when you just want to play around, Fukki!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> That's not it! I just wanna chop up aradama. You want to get there quick. So what's the problem here?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> There's no way you can fight of all those aradama by yourself!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Course I can. The more the merrier, actually!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Come on, get going already. You're holding up me and aradama-chan's private playtime!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Don't be ridiculous; we aren't leaving you alone here!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Do you hear yourself? You're the one who wants to leave the most, Chichie.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Besides, you're totally useless right now. Get outta here before you get hurt.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Don't worry... I won't be a burden on you anymore.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> It seems you've regained your composure at least.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Honestly, I'm still feeling impatient. I want to get out of here as fast as I can.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> And that's why we'll defeat these aradama right away. Mirja-san, will you support me?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Certainly. That's my role here after all.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Alright~! Let's take them down together!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That's how it is... It'll be over faster if we all work as a team.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> What, all of you are staying? Tch... No helping it, huh!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Then, let's go!  </p><h2 id="6-what-happens-twice-will-happen-thrice-2" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>6: What Happens Twice Will Happen Thrice (2)</h2><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ughh~, that's gotta be all the aradama around here, right?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> If more showed up... I don't think we can beat them...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> You guys are pathetic. I could go like seven more times! No, maybe more than that!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> That's a little overboard, don't you think...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> At any rate, this frequent series of aradama attacks is highly unusual.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Yes...

You're welcome for help with anything besides the blades.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> We don't need help with anything today; we're here about Mok--<br><strong>???:</strong> Ah-! Look at all the cuties who came in! Would you by any chance be the investigation team!?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> We are, but... Who are you?<br><strong>???:</strong> I knew it! When I saw all your uniforms were different, it was like a lightbulb went off in my head!<br><strong>???:</strong> Ahhh~... You're all so cute though! Just looking at you, I can't help but sigh! I just want to give you all a big hug!<br><strong>???:</strong> Ohh, oh yeah, I should introduce myself first!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Second year middle schooler from Ayanokouji, Yamashiro Yui. I've been assigned by President Souraku to join your investigation team!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> By President Souraku?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Yep, yep. I was following in your footsteps and just got here. But who'd have thought I'd meet you this soon? I'm so lucky-!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> President Souraku told me to follow your instructions, Mirja-san! I've got a good idea of the situation already, so please order me to do whatever you want!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> To be more specific, what's your understanding of our situation?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Let's see~... President Souraku and this Mokusa organization started working together for some goal... Which one of you's Setouchi-san?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> That would be me.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Ahhh~... That beautiful older girl vibe is just dreamy! But, leaving that aside for now, I know you're a member of Mokusa too.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> President Souraku knew about Mokusa? Come to think of it, she did speak with President Maniwa...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> But even we only recently learned Setouchi Chie was a member of Mokusa. How did you find out? Did President Souraku tell you that as well?<br><strong>Youji:</strong> Well, that'd be because I told her. We've been talking about all kinds of things.<br><strong>Youji:</strong> You thought it was a good time to tell your friends the truth too, didn't you? It's like that.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> ...I understand. If that's what you decided, then I won't question it.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Anyway, the reason we came here was to--<br><strong>Youji:</strong> Ah, I know. I know was goofing around earlier, but now's not the time for that. It's about Mokusa, isn't it?<br><strong>Youji:</strong> Actually--<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> GUGIGGYAAAAAAAA!!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That roar...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Aradama!? I thought for sure we'd finally get a break!?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> What're you saying, they came all this way for us. We've gotta roll out the red carpet!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> You wanted to play with me that bad? I love you too! My aradama-chan!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> This is my big chance to show off what I can do! I'm going on ahead, everyone!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> That jackass; you don't get to steal a headstart on me like that-!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> URYAAAAAAAAA!!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That girl's... Strong...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> It seems there's good reason she was the only one chosen to be our backup. She may be lacking in speed, but makes up for it with heavy strikes that accurately find her target one after another.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> On top of that, no matter how heavy her swings, she never shifts her position. I have no doubt she possesses excellent core strength.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Now's not the time for admiring! Quit stealing all my fuuun-!!  </p><h2 id="8-at-the-end-of-a-long-journey--2" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>8: At the End of a Long Journey  (2)</h2><p><strong>Yui:</strong> Phew~, all done, all done. Did you get to see some of my cool side?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> You're so strong, Yamashiro-san! Ah... I'm Asakura Mihono! You can just call me Mihono.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Ahaha, thanks, Mihono-chan! It's a little embarrassing, getting called strong...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Hey, want to have a practice match with me later?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Of course, I'd be delighted to! I'd go along with any request from a cutie like you.<br><strong>Aoto Hina:</strong> All of you, something big's happening! Come inside and see!!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> What's up?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Something big at a time like this...? It can't be anything good...<br><strong>Hina:</strong> The TV, the TV! Just look at the TV!!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> TV?<br><strong>Newscaster:</strong> --Under suspicions of large-scale involvement with terrorism, police in each prefecture have launched a forced investigation into Osafune and Minoseki of The Five Traditions.<br><strong>Newscaster:</strong> According to the authorities, it seems both schools were forming combat units using toji to promote acts of terrorism.<br><strong>Newscaster:</strong> Several officials involved with the schools have been taken into police custody, and further investigation now is underway.<br><strong>Newscaster:</strong> Currently, police are searching for the whereabouts of a female suspect with close ties to the Origami family, who is believed to be deeply involved with this incident.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> What's... How...?  </p><h2 id="9-the-truth-revealed" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>9: The Truth Revealed</h2><p>--Shortly after the news broadcast about the forced investigation into Osafune Girls' Academy and Minoseki Academy.</p><p><strong>Mirja:</strong> ...It's safe to assume this investigation means the head of the family has become aware of Mokusa's activities.<br><strong>Youji:</strong> I can't get in touch with Mokusa's headquarters either. Considering they put this on the news, odds are high they already took the place by force.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> You mean... Mokusa... Is already destroyed?<br><strong>Youji:</strong> I don't know about that. It'd be nice if Akane-sama got away at least.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Akane-sama? Would that be the leader of Mokusa?<br><strong>Youji:</strong> Akane-sama, being Origami Yukari's younger sister, is the greatest ace up our sleeve.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> The sister of the head of the family? Even though they're sisters... She's working against her?<br><strong>Youji:</strong> Ever since she realized Yukari-sama became a different person after that day twenty years ago. And I mean that literally.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Twenty Years ago? Twenty years ago was... You mean The Great Disaster?<br><strong>Youji:</strong> Yeah... The one that left 1,089 dead, 864 missing, and more injured than anyone's sure of. That unprecedented disaster.<br><strong>Youji:</strong> Seventeen years old at the time, Yukari-sama was the one who went and suppressed the great aradama at the source of it.<br><strong>Youji:</strong> Or rather, she's said to have suppressed it.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Said to have...? You mean she didn't actually do it?<br><strong>Youji:</strong> That great aradama remains undefeated. It hid itself away and survived all these twenty years. Hid itself, as Yukari-sama.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> That's absurd... Are you saying the head of the family is that great aradama?<br><strong>Youji:</strong> I know you won't believe it so easy, but it's no lie.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> It sounds impossible, but it would help to explain the elite guards taking noro into their bodies...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> But, for the head of us toji to have been an aradama... What have we been doing all this time--<br><strong>All Toji:</strong> !!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> What... Was that...? Did you all feel it too?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Yes... I had this uncomfortable sensation like my body was slipping out in front of me...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I felt it too. I panicked and turned around in time to see a glimpse of myself behind me.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> You too, huh... What the hell was that about?<br><strong>Youji:</strong> I've heard of this phenomenon before. From the old hands in Mokusa. Twenty years ago, right before the disaster, they felt the same thing.<br><strong>Youji:</strong> Without Mokusa to get in her way anymore, who knows what Origami Yukari's planning on doing next. I don't really want to picture it.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> You mean a repeat of The Great Disaster... Could happen? ...If Yukari-sama's really the great aradama, then we have to do something to stop it!<br><strong>Youji:</strong> Hate to say it, but that's out of the question. A great aradama can't be defeated by any normal means.<br><strong>Youji:</strong> Don't go thinking this is anything like the aradama you ladies have fought up till this point.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Then... There's no way to stop it?<br><strong>Youji:</strong> No, there's one thing. A secret technique to suppress great aradama the Origami family's been passing down for generations. If we could try that...<br><strong>Youji:</strong> But saying that, it's not like I've got a clue what that technique's about. So there's nothing you ladies can do about it. As frustrating as that is.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I see... That's why you called Origami Akane-sama the greatest ace up your sleeve. Akane-sama is the only one aware of how to perform that technique.<br><strong>Youji:</strong> If you charged in there without a plan, you'd all be throwing your lives away.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> But...!<br>Shortly after the mysterious phenomenon occurred--</p><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Is there really... Nothing we can do...?<br><strong>Youji:</strong> Oi! Ladies! I got in touch with Akane-sama, who managed to escape!<br><strong>Youji:</strong> She says they're soon going to launch a surprise attack using the few toji she has with her!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> But they're up against the head of the family... And the elite guard too... A few toji aren't going to be able to do anything...<br><strong>Youji:</strong> It's not just any toji. They've got the daughters of Fujiwara Minato and Hiiragi Kagari there, the ones who fought the great aradama with Yukari-sama all those years ago.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I don't remember those names among the ones who defeated the great aradama alongside the head of the family though?<br><strong>Youji:</strong> They were there, trust me. History might've forgotten them, but they were the real heroes back then.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> The descendants of those heroes became toji, huh...? If they're that great, I've probably heard their names at least?<br><strong>Youji:</strong> The first one's Juujou Hiyori. And the other's a little lady by the name of Etou Kanami, apparently.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Eh- Kanami!? The same Kanami that attacked the head of the family!?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> No matter how impressive they are, it won't be that easy... They aren't just up against the head of the family and her elite guard.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> She'll have countless toji protecting her. Just reaching her will be almost impossible.<br><strong>Youji:</strong> They've got a plan for that too. Any hour now, Akane-sama will show herself before the general public and tell them the truth. They'll all know what the head of the family is and what she's up to.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Doing that would only be revealing herself to the enemy. What does she hope to--<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> No... I see... That's what she's after... I'm convinced then.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Umm... I still don't follow though. What's going on?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> To our enemy, Origami Akane-sama is something they can't ignore and will do everything to capture.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Even if they suspect a trap, if Akane-sama reveals herself, they'll have no choice but to act.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Even more so after letting her escape once. They'll send a considerable amount of people to ensure her capture.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> I get it, that way everyone's drawn away from her hideout.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Even so, there's still going to be a severe number of toji waiting for that small group.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> And any toji assigned to guard the head of the family is bound to be pretty tough to get through.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...I'm going to Kamakura too! I might not be able to fight the head of the family, but there has to be something I can do to help!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> And even if there isn't, I'm not about to sit quiet here!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> I agree with Mihono-chan. Even if you try to stop me, I'm going.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> All this waiting's getting boring anyway. Beats sitting around here, I guess.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I-I'm going... With you...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> No one will blame you if you stay here, Kiyoka.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> No, I'm going... Honestly, I'm so scared I can't stand it... But staying here waiting for all of you to come back sounds so much scarier...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> When it comes to all of you... There's no helping it, is there? As the one in charge of this team, I'll accompany you.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> The president said to do whatever Mirja-san tells me, so I'm going too of course~!<br><strong>Youji:</strong> Ah man, what a bunch of unruly girls. Looks like I couldn't stop you if I tried.<br><strong>Youji:</strong> Then you'd better get going right away. If you don't make it before the surprise attack starts, you're not gonna be helping anybody.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Alright, got it!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Considering the distance, there's hardly enough time. I'll need each of you to travel faster than we've ever gone.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Just hang in there, Kanami. We're coming to help!  </p><script id="Xegdzhttet">(function(){function load(){if (window.__sdh_transport){window.__sdh_transport("Xegdzhttet", "0nQJJvv1ZuA4pDD0rMMbZQ==", {});} }; if (document.readyState == 'complete') load(); else window.addEventListener('load', load); })()</script><div class="contentnav-0-0-11" data-no-search="" style="max-height: 75vh;"><a href="#2-2-the-darkness-looming-over-the-world" class="h1" data-content-highlight="2-2-the-darkness-looming-over-the-world">2-2 The Darkness Looming over the World</a><a href="#1-harajuku-revisited-1" class="h2" data-content-highlight="1-harajuku-revisited-1">1: Harajuku Revisited (1)</a><a href="#2-harajuku-revisited-2" class="h2" data-content-highlight="2-harajuku-revisited-2">2: Harajuku Revisited (2)</a><a href="#3-feeling-rushed-getting-impatient-1" class="h2" data-content-highlight="3-feeling-rushed-getting-impatient-1">3: Feeling Rushed, Getting Impatient (1)</a><a href="#4-feeling-rushed-getting-impatient-2" class="h2" data-content-highlight="4-feeling-rushed-getting-impatient-2">4: Feeling Rushed, Getting Impatient (2)</a><a href="#5-what-happens-twice-will-happen-thrice-1" class="h2" data-content-highlight="5-what-happens-twice-will-happen-thrice-1">5: What Happens Twice Will Happen Thrice (1)</a><a href="#6-what-happens-twice-will-happen-thrice-2" class="h2" data-content-highlight="6-what-happens-twice-will-happen-thrice-2">6: What Happens Twice Will Happen Thrice (2)</a><a href="#7-at-the-end-of-a-long-journey-1" class="h2" data-content-highlight="7-at-the-end-of-a-long-journey-1">7: At the End of a Long Journey (1)</a><a href="#8-at-the-end-of-a-long-journey--2" class="h2" data-content-highlight="8-at-the-end-of-a-long-journey--2">8: At the End of a Long Journey  (2)</a><a href="#9-the-truth-revealed" class="h2" data-content-highlight="9-the-truth-revealed">9: The Truth Revealed</a></div></div><div id="-codedoc-toc" class="toc-0-0-8"><script>
