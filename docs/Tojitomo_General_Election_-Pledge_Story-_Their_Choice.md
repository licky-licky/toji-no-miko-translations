## 1: Mihono's Sensing Something Wrong
**Yomi:** The six of us, Tsubakuro-san, Setouchi-san, Asakura-san, Etou-san, Yamashiro-san, and myself, will be carrying out an aradama suppression assignment.  
**Yume:** Hey, Yomi-onee-sa...  
**Chie:** I hope we can work well together, Satsuki-san.  
**Yume:** ...Actually, Chidori-onee-san! Since we got put on a mission together, let's have lots of fun!  
**Kanami:** Sure! I'm excited too, Yume-chan.  
**Mihono:** ...?  
**Yui:** What's the holdup, Mihono-chan? We're all leaving.  
**Mihono:** Ah-- Okay! I'll be right there!  
**Mihono:** ...  
**Mihono:** (Hmmm, don't think I was imagining it after all.)  
**Mihono:** (Tsubakuro-san was definitely avoiding Chii-nee.)  
**Mihono:** (I know Chii-nee doesn't really like Tsubakuro-san, but why's she avoiding Chii-nee?)  
**Mihono:** ...Is it cause Chii-nee's scary? No, there's no way, right...?  
**Chie:** Mihono-chan, you think I'm scary...?  
**Mihono:** Ah-- Did I say that out loud!?  
**Yui:** Yep. It came out loud and clear.  
**Chie:** I know that, lately, I've been less reserved when I'm around the girls from the investigation team...  
**Chie:** Should I try being a little more patient with Kofuki-chan when she causes trouble...?  
**Mihono:** It's not like that, Chii-nee!  
**Mihono:** I mean, yeah, when you're with Fukki, sometimes you get really scary, but that's all Fukki's fault!  
**Chie:** So I really do scare you... I thought I was being a nice friendly onee-san, but I guess not...  
**Mihono:** Crap; that just made her depressed.  
**Yui:** It's fine, it's fine, I'll make sure to comfort her!  
**Yui:** But anyway, what's on your mind that you were talking to yourself like that, Mihono-chan?  
**Mihono:** That's cause...  
**Mihono:** (Wait, if I bring up Tsubakuro-san in front of Chii-nee...)  
**Yui:** You can't say?  
**Mihono:** ...Kind of. Mm, sorry. I'm gonna get up for a bit.  
**Mihono:** Tsubakuro-san, could I talk to you real quick?  
**Yume:** What do you want, Onee-san?  
**Mihono:** There's something I wanted to ask you...  
**Mihono:** (Wait? But, how am I supposed to ask? Uhh...)  
**Mihono:** Are you scared of Chii-nee?  
**Mihono:** (That was way too blunt!?)  
**Yume:** ......I don't wanna talk about it.  
**Mihono:** (Of course she wouldn't! I messed this up... Aghh.)  
**Mihono:** Sorry for asking something weird, Tsubakuro-san.  
**Mihono:** (But, I still want to know... Now I'll just have to ask Satsuki-san.)  

## 2: Yomi's Tough Position
**Mihono:** Satsuki-san, can I talk to you?  
**Yomi:** ...  
**Mihono:** Uh...  
**Mihono:** (She's not... unhappy to see me or anything, is she? Ughh, she has that blank look on her face, so I can't tell what she's thinking!)  
**Yomi:** Did you not need anything?  
**Mihono:** No wait, I did!  
**Mihono:** (It's alright, I had a feeling this would happen, so I came prepared!)  
**Mihono:** Here, have some onigiri!  
**Yomi:** Omusubi.  
**Mihono:** Eh?  
**Yomi:** They're omusubi.  
**Mihono:** Y-Yeah, omusubi!  
**Yomi:** Thank you very much for the food.  
**Mihono:** (Okay... I think that broke the ice... Now go!)   
**Mihono:** Um, actually, I had something I wanted to ask; is Tsubakuro-san scared of Chii-nee?  
**Yomi:** She hasn't told me anything about it.  
**Mihono:** Then, could you ask her for me!  
**Yomi:** ...So that's what these omusubi were for. Fine, I'll ask her.  
**Yomi:** I was looking for you.  
**Yume:** Yomi-onee-san?  
**Yomi:** There's something I need to ask. Are you afraid of Setouchi-san?  
**Yume:** ...Did Kashuu Kiyomitsu-onee-san tell you to ask me?  
**Yomi:** She did.  
**Yume:** I knew it...  
**Yomi:** Could you tell me?  
**Yume:** She's the one......  
**Yomi:** ?  
**Yume:** She's the one... who doesn't like me. Maki-onee-san told me.  
**Yume:** She said, that onee-san's from Mokusa, so she thinks bad of me. Basically, she hates me, right?  
**Yomi:** ...  
**Yume:** I don't want to talk to somebody who hates me if I don't have to. It wouldn't be any fun.  
**Yomi:** So that's why.  
**Yume:** Ah-- But you can't tell those onee-sans, okay! I'm only telling you, Yomi-onee-san.  
**Yomi:** ......I understand.  
**Yomi:** (The other onee-sans... I can't tell Asakura-san or Setouchi-san.)  
**Yomi:** (...This is a problem.)  

## 3: Yui's Dependability
**Yomi:** ......In the end, she refused to tell me either.  
**Mihono:** She didn't...? Well, thanks for trying!  
**Yomi:** Now I've kept my promise with Tsubakuro-san. I feel as if I've done something wrong to Asakura-san though.  
**Yomi:** There's still friction between Tsubakuro-san and Setouchi-san, but it shouldn't create any issues dealing with aradama.  
**Yomi:** Only... If I left Tsubakuro-san alone after she looked like that...  
**Yomi:** ...She said... I couldn't tell Asakura-san or Setouchi-san, didn't she.  
**Yomi:** ...  
**Yomi:** I'll try speaking with Etou-san or Yamashiro-san.  
**Yomi:** Yamashiro-san.  
**Yui:** Ah-- Yomi-san!  
**Yui:** What's up? Did you need something? Oh; if you're asking me out on a date, the answer's yes by the way!  
**Yomi:** ...  
**Yui:** Wait... ARE YOU REALLY ASKING ME OUT!?  
**Yomi:** (What is Yamashiro-san talking about?)  
**Yomi:** That's not it. It's about...  
**Yui:** I see... Basically, you're saying cute girls look best when they're smiling!  
**Yomi:** ...?  
**Yomi:** Were you listening to what I said?  
**Yui:** Every last word!  
**Yomi:** ...  
**Yomi:** I'll try explaining again. It started with...  
**Yui:** Basically, THE SPECIAL DEFENSE TEAM IS SUPER PRECIOUS! I get it!  
**Yomi:** Precious...?  
**Yomi:** (Does Yamashiro-san not understand Japanese? I must have picked the wrong person to talk to.)  
**Yui:** No need to look so worried! Everything'll be fine; just let me take care of this!  
**Yomi:** ...That just gives me more concerns.  

## 4: Kanami's on the Wrong Page
**Yui:** Kanami-chan! Help me come up with ways to get Chie-san and Yume-chan to make up!  
**Kanami:** Sure thing!  
**Kanami:** ...But, wouldn't it be better to get Mihono-chan's help with Setouchi-san?  
**Yui:** About that, apparently Yume-chan gave Mihono-chan the no go.  
**Yui:** Which is why it's up to you and me to come together and do something!  
**Kanami:** ...She did? Alright then, let's give it our best shot together!  
**Kanami:** (Yui-chan's so serious about this... She's such a nice person.)  
**Yui:** (Guhehe, now I can talk Kanami-chan into doing all sorts of stuff with me...)  
**Kanami:** So, what do we try first?  
**Yui:** We take a bath!  
**Kanami:** Hmmm, but I don't really think a bath's going to do anything...  
**Yui:** Don't be like that! Nothing's going to bring us closer together like a bath!  
**Kanami:** ...I guess you have a point?  
**Kanami:** Then, you call Setouchi-san. And we can get Satsuki-san to ask Yume-chan?  
**Yui:** Huh?  
**Kanami:** ?  
**Yui:** Ah, you mean for Chie-san and Yume-chan! Sorry, I was thinking about something else!  
**Kanami:** How are you already getting off track!?  
**Yui:** You know, I'm not really sure shoving two people who can't get along into a bath together is going to help.  
**Kanami:** That's what I was saying at the start!  
**Yui:** Ahaha, whoops, sorry!  
**Yui:** Well huh... How about we start by thinking of something that'd make both of them happy? Then we might be able to work with that.  
**Kanami:** Hmm, something that Yume-chan would be happy with...  
**Kanami:** What about sparring?  
**Yui:** That's just what makes you happy, Kanami-chan.  
**Kanami:** Yeah, it makes me really happy. But I don't think I'm wrong about Yume-chan either.  
**Kanami:** Did you come up with anything, Yui-chan?  
**Yui:** So, you know how Chie-san's a big sister type? There's no way she wouldn't have good chemistry with Yume-chan then.  
**Yui:** If we can get them to make up, I bet Chie-san'd be all over Yume-chan!  
**Kanami:** ...But I mean, aren't we talking about how to get them to make up in the first place?  
**Yui:** Oh yeah!  
**Kanami:** I wish you'd listen to me, Yui-chan!  
**Yui:** Okay, what if you act like Yume-chan and we see how Chie-san reacts!  
**Kanami:** EHHHHHHHHHH!?  

## 5: Chie's Determination
**Kanami:** U-Um, Setouchi-san!  
**Chie:** Etou-san?  
**Yui:** (Not like that, Kanami-chan! That's just you being your usual you!)  
**Kanami:** (Ugh... Yui-chan's looking this way... Fine, I've just gotta do it!)  
**Kanami:** Ch-Chie-onee-san!!  
**Chie:** ......  
**Chie:** Etou-san?  
**Kanami:** U-Uh, I didn't mean that...  
**Kanami:** (This is all your fault, Yui-chan!)  
**Yui:** (I got a nice embarrassed "Chie-onee-san"!!)  
**Chie:** Mihono-chan? Or... is that you, Yui-chan?  
**Kanami:** Eh?  
**Chie:** ...So it's Yui-chan hiding over there. I'm sorry for this, Etou-san.  
**Kanami:** U-Uh...  
**Chie:** Don't worry; I understand everything. I'll be sure to punish her as much as she deserves later.  
**Yui:** (Ah... This is starting to turn bad... I gotta get out of here...)  
**Chie:** You know what'll happen if you run.  
**Yui:** !?  
**Kanami:** I-It's not like that, Setouchi-san! There's a reason for this...  
**Chie:** A reason?  
**Kanami:** Yui-chan asked me to... Ah, but Satsuki-san was the one who asked Yui-chan in the first place...  
**Kanami:** Apparently Mihono-chan was worried about how things are between you and Yume-chan.  
**Chie:** Eh...?  
**Chie:** (Ah... Back then, when she said I was scary, that must be what she meant...)  
**Chie:** But then, why was it Yui-chan who asked you instead of Mihono-chan?  
**Kanami:** Well, a bunch of stuff happened...  
**Kanami:** And we just... Me and Yui-chan hoped things could get a little better with you and Yume-chan.  
**Kanami:** And, we thought we could do something...  
**Chie:** So, why "Chie-onee-san"?  
**Kanami:** ...I was kinda trying to copy Yume-chan.  
**Chie:** (How did they even come to the conclusion that Etou-san should try copying Tsubakuro-san...?)  
**Chie:** ...I'm sorry you had to go through something embarrassing because of me.  
**Kanami:** (She said it's embarrassing... Ughh.)  
**Chie:** And, thank you for doing all this for me.  
**Chie:** ...I'll try talking with Tsubakuro-san.  

## 6: Yume's Response
**Yume:** What is it, Yomi-onee-san?  
**Chie:** Good evening.  
**Yume:** Ah...  
**Yume:** Y-Yomi-onee-san needed me for something, right? I'll go find her.  
**Chie:** It's not... as if I've forgiven you.  
**Yume:** ...Sigh. I told Yomi-onee-san to keep it secret...  
**Yume:** I know that. And, it doesn't really matter. It wouldn't change what I did.  
**Chie:** You aren't going to make excuses?  
**Yume:** I'm not. Even if you did forgive me, there's lots of people who'd still be just like you, right?  
**Yume:** I don't want to go making excuses to all those people.  
**Chie:** No matter what excuse you gave me... I wouldn't forgive you. You owe them more than that.  
**Chie:** Which is why... Let's fight. When I win, then we can move past this.  
**Yume:** There's no way you'll win though.  
**Chie:** Even so, I'll win.  
**Yume:** ...I don't want to. I'm not going to fight you, Onee-san.  
**Chie:** And why not?  
**Chie:** You want to be remembered for how strong you are, don't you? Isn't that why you cut down everyone in Mokusa?  
**Yume:** I do, but...  
**Yume:** It's just... this is how that ended up. I don't like being remembered like this...  
**Chie:** ...  
**Yume:** Do you remember back when we did the charity stuff for Miss Gokaden?  
**Chie:** I remember.  
**Yume:** Back then... Yomi-onee-san told me this.  
**Yume:** ...Those kids there would never forget my strength.  
**Chie:** ...  
**Yume:** But that's weird, right? It's not like they even got to see me when I was fighting. But they still remembered how I helped them.  
**Yume:** And... Yeah. I felt like, if people are going to remember me, I like it better like that.  
**Chie:** Is that why you won't fight me? You're really... selfish, aren't you.  
**Yume:** I can't help it if it's more fun that way.  
**Chie:** ...That's true.  
**Yume:** Huh?  
**Chie:** I can tell you do have regrets, and you are growing from it.  
**Chie:** So then, I should...  
**Chie:** I shouldn't go saying things like, I'll never forgive you. It makes me seem like the childish one.  
**Yume:** Onee-san...?  
**Chie:** What you've said just now, I'll never forget it for the rest of my life.  
**Chie:** So, Tsubakuro-san... I want you to never forget this feeling now either.  
**Yume:** ...Does this mean, you'll make up with me?  
**Chie:** It does.  
**Yume:** ...Okay! I'll make sure I don't forget! So thanks, Onee-san!
