For reasons unknown, the film set of a historical drama has frequently come under attack.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> If this report made it all the way to me, that must mean standard attempts at stopping them haven&#x27;t worked.<br>
<strong>Kazumi:</strong> Yes, it&#x27;s just as you&#x27;ve guessed, Maki-sama. Several days ago, the toji responsible for the area reported that they had finished suppressing the aradama.<br>
<strong>Kazumi:</strong> However, aradama have been sighted at that film studio several times after.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ...And they can&#x27;t get any filming done like that, can they.<br>
<strong>Kazumi:</strong> The studio is in the middle of filming a drama about the Shinsengumi, and doesn&#x27;t wish to suspend shooting any longer than necessary. They have requested we eliminate all of the aradama.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> It&#x27;s possible some might have escaped the first time, but maybe there&#x27;s some underlying reason they came back?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Though it won&#x27;t do any good to worry about it here. I&#x27;ll head to that film studio myself.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> And I&#x27;d like your assistance. Come with me.<br>
<strong>Kazumi:</strong> Whatever you face, wherever you go, I would join you, Maki-sama.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> You love to exagerrate, don&#x27;t you, Kazumi.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Oh. One more thing. I&#x27;d also like to bring a few inexperienced toji with us. Can I ask you to handle selecting them?<br>
<strong>Kazumi:</strong> That won&#x27;t be an issue, though... It may cause us trouble carrying out our mission.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> It doesn&#x27;t matter. What&#x27;s important is they have a chance to improve. They may have some difficulties, but the two of us should be able to take care of them, shouldn&#x27;t we?<br>
<strong>Kazumi:</strong> ...Yes!<br>
<strong>Kazumi:</strong> (Without fail... I&#x27;ll do what it takes to meet Maki-sama&#x27;s expectations.)<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Preparing the next generation is one of our most important responsibilities, you know.<br>
<strong>Kazumi:</strong> Then, I&#x27;ll find several candidates and call them here. Please give me some time.<br>
<strong>Kazumi:</strong> From talking to the studio&#x27;s supervisor and director, aradama were seen around this lot again today.<br>
<strong>Kazumi:</strong> They said they can avoid filming on this set for the time being, but the film crew is still feeling concerned.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I&#x27;ll bet... I&#x27;d prefer if they stopped filming altogether until things have settled with the aradama here.<br>
<strong>Novice Toji A:</strong> M-My spectrum finder is picking up a few signals! ...They&#x27;re close by!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Already showing themselves then.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> We&#x27;re going into combat. Stick close to me. However, don&#x27;t do anything you don&#x27;t feel safe with.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> HAAAH-!<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Novice Toji B:</strong> Wow... They all went down, before I could blink.<br>
<strong>Novice Toji C:</strong> That&#x27;s just how strong Shidou-senpai is!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Did they drop something just now?<br>
<strong>Kazumi:</strong> Koban, it seems. More than likely a prop used in the filming here. [Koban are the golden oval coins used in feudal Japan]<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Just to be safe, I&#x27;ll bring these back with us.<br>
<strong>Kazumi:</strong> Then, I will guide the other girls through recovering the noro.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Of course, thanks.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> It would be great if that&#x27;s the end of them, but it can&#x27;t be that easy.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="2-unexpected-reinforcements"></a>2: Unexpected Reinforcements?<a class="hash-link" href="#2-unexpected-reinforcements" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Kazumi:</strong> Maki-sama, I&#x27;m picking up aradama in this direction.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Everyone, prepare to fight.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Don&#x27;t get careless, but if you do like you did in training, destroying aradama isn&#x27;t that difficult.<br>
<strong>Novice Toji D:</strong> Sh-Shidou-senpai...!? Some toji are already engaging the aradama!?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> That&#x27;s...<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...Kofuki.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Yeah, just leave it to me! Show me a good time, aradama-chan!<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Heheh... And another one done!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> More koban came out.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Beats me why. But who cares; let&#x27;s go looking for the next aradama-chan.<br>
<strong>Kazumi:</strong> You two, the toji from Renpu... Just what do you think you&#x27;re doing?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Huh? We&#x27;re toji, duh. Can&#x27;t you figure the rest out?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Kofuki, you shouldn&#x27;t talk to people like that. We&#x27;re defeating the aradama.<br>
<strong>Kazumi:</strong> That isn&#x27;t what I meant--<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Kazumi. First, that noro needs to be secured. Go ahead with the preparations. I&#x27;ll question these two.<br>
<strong>Kazumi:</strong> Understood. I&#x27;ll recover it straight away then.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I came because I detected the aradama, but it seems you&#x27;ve safely brought them down.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> You&#x27;re here too, Kitora Mirja...? Could I get you to explain why you&#x27;re all here?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Tsugumi asked us to come here and defeat the strange aradama.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> As soon as she finds out about some aradama acting funny, she starts asking for data.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Ban Tsugumi. The toji attached to the aradama research team. If aradama are being suppressed, she would want a report on it. And you?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I was off duty today, so I came to see a sword exhibit which had opened at a nearby museum.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Afterwards, I stopped by this film studio, and that was when I detected the aradama.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I see. I understand your circumstances now.<br>
<strong>Kazumi:</strong> Then, Maki-sama, what should we do about these three?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> &quot;Maki-sama&quot;?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> First, you two from Renpu. You helped us out by defeating the aradama, but you&#x27;ll create problems acting on your own like that. You&#x27;re going to be following our instructions now.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Understood.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...If you say so.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I can help too, Shidou Maki. I may be off duty, but I still have a responsibility when aradama are involved.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Good. In that case, you can manage those two. I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve been on plenty of missions together, with the investigation team. I&#x27;ll leave a few from our unit with you too.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I&#x27;ll be counting on you when our unit needs to coordinate with yours.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I understand; that should be for the best. Itomi Sayaka, Shichinosato Kofuki, I look forward to working with you.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Course, same here.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> You look happy, Kofuki.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re talking about. Let&#x27;s get going already.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Wait until we all leave, Shichinosato Kofuki.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="3-how-toji-fight-and-grow"></a>3: How Toji Fight and Grow<a class="hash-link" href="#3-how-toji-fight-and-grow" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Novice Toji A:</strong> ...W-We&#x27;re going to fight that aradama, aren&#x27;t we.<br>
<strong>Novice Toji C:</strong> It&#x27;s kind of scary...<br>
<strong>Kazumi:</strong> It&#x27;s natural to feel uneasy. Even so, you are toji. You mustn&#x27;t forget that.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> This is the largest of any we&#x27;ve defeated today. Alright, let me handle that one myself.<br>
<strong>Kazumi:</strong> Maki-sama... You&#x27;ll fight it alone?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> That way, I can take care of it without putting them in danger. I need you to take care of the other smaller aradama for me, Kazumi.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Handling all of them at once would be too much for me.<br>
<strong>Kazumi:</strong> Understood. I can&#x27;t allow you to be in danger either, Maki-sama.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Right, that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m glad you&#x27;re with me. The rest of you, follow Kazumi&#x27;s directions as you suppress the aradama.<br>
<strong>Two Novice Toji:</strong> ...U-Understood!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ...Hmph! Time to finish this.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> HYAAAAAAAA-!<br>
<strong>Novice Toji C:</strong> Amazing... Shidou-senpai, she beat an aradama that big with one swing...<br>
<strong>Novice Toji C:</strong> ...Eh!?<br>
<strong>Kazumi:</strong> You don&#x27;t have the luxury of looking away. Focus on the aradama before you.<br>
<strong>Novice Toji C:</strong> R-Right! Thank you, Watanuki-senpai...!<br>
<strong>Novice Toji A:</strong> ...TAAAH-!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> You&#x27;re doing great. If you keep up the effort, this mission will be done in no time.<br>
<strong>Novice Toji A:</strong> Th-Thank you very much! Because of Watanuki-senpai&#x27;s support earlier, I think I understand my timing better...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Kazumi always does such a reliable job. Even I count on her support. So, she&#x27;d make a good role model for you.<br>
<strong>Kazumi:</strong> ...That&#x27;s more praise than I deserve. I&#x27;ll do everything I can to continue meeting your expectations, Maki-sama.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> You always surpass them though. Don&#x27;t feel the need to force yourself. Anyway, let&#x27;s move on to the next group.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> The two of you will go after the aradama as a two man unit.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> If the aradama seems to be running, in order to keep damage to the studio to a minimum, lead it to the main street where Itomi Sayaka and Shichinosato Kofuki are waiting!<br>
<strong>Novice Toji B:</strong> ...G-Got it!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> We may have been hastily assembled, but we are a team. There&#x27;s no need for you to fight by yourself. Understood?<br>
<strong>Novice Toji D:</strong> ...Yes ma&#x27;am!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mirja... What next?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Deal with the aradama in the main street, bearing in mind that Shichinosato Kofuki may leave her position.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Understood.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> The hell, you think I&#x27;m some kinda dog that&#x27;ll go running off chasing the first aradama-chan I see?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...Won&#x27;t you?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Sayaka... Now you&#x27;re giving me attitude too!? So long as the aradama-chan keep coming, I&#x27;m not going anywhere!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Then I&#x27;ll hold you to that, Shichinosato Kofuki!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> --Alright, alright, here they come!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Aradama-chan, I love you-!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> I&#x27;ll take this one.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Come on; it&#x27;s first come, first serve!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Then, I&#x27;ll go first.<br>
<strong>Novice Toji B:</strong> You know? I was disappointed, getting pulled off of Shidou-senpai&#x27;s unit, but...<br>
<strong>Novice Toji D:</strong> These girls are pretty impressive too...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Rather than defeating them, you need to become used to fighting aradama. We&#x27;re going to be herding the aradama into the main street!<br>
<strong>Two Novice Toji:</strong> ...Understood!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Even with the unpredictable Shichinosato Kofuki under her command, Kitora Mirja is expertly directing them.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> More than fighting personally, taking command seems to be her specialty.<br>
<strong>Kazumi:</strong> Yes, I can tell she&#x27;s taking care not to push those inexperienced toji too hard.<br>
<strong>Kazumi:</strong> While their plan is primarily to herd the aradama, if the chance arises, she steps in to finish them herself.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> It&#x27;ll do well for getting them used to working in the field. We might get unexpectedly good results from this.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="4-a-big-brawl-eliminating-aradama"></a>4: A Big Brawl Eliminating Aradama<a class="hash-link" href="#4-a-big-brawl-eliminating-aradama" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Kazumi:</strong> That&#x27;s the source of all this trouble. What an... Ominous aradama...<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Tch... Why am I stuck with the small fry?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> There are still other aradama to be dealt with! You don&#x27;t time to waste complaining.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> I know already!<br>
<strong>Kazumi:</strong> Maki-sama... May the battle end in our favor.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Kh... A little more. If this goes on, the studio will be destroyed...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Right, we have to finish it off with our next attack!! Give me a hand!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Understood.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> --This is it for you! HAAAAAAAAH-!!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Look at all the koban...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> The aradama that accompanied it are fleeing! We can&#x27;t allow them to escape--<br>
<strong>Kazumi:</strong> ...That goes without saying!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> I could handle all these myself!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Impressive work; just as I would expect from you two.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Kitora Mirja, Itomi Sayaka, Shichinosato Kofuki. Thank you for your assistance today.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> If you wanted to thank me, you should&#x27;ve let me have that big one back there.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Out of the question. You tend to toy around too much instead of finishing the job.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Tch... And now I don&#x27;t get to have any fun.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Is something on your mind, Itomi Sayaka?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> We defeated a lot of aradama today, so we got a lot of data. Tsugumi should be happy too.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I see. I&#x27;m sure that she will be.<br>
<strong>Studio Manager:</strong> You said you&#x27;re done suppressing the aradama, but... Uh, is it really safe around here?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I understand your concern. But, this time, we&#x27;ve destroyed what we think was the source of the aradama. They shouldn&#x27;t appear here any longer.<br>
<strong>Studio Manager:</strong> ...Phew. Thank you very much. That&#x27;ll give us some peace of mind, right, director?<br>
<strong>Film Director:</strong> That&#x27;s good to hear. Now we can finish filming that big action scene we started! I really can&#x27;t thank you enough!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> You don&#x27;t have to thank us. We just did what we need to as toji.<br>
<strong>Film Director:</strong> I mean it! I watched your fighting from a distance, and it was so inspiring. It&#x27;ll make great reference material!<br>
<strong>Film Director:</strong> You should take these, as a show of appreciation. Thank you. I have to get going now!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Ah... But, we can&#x27;t accept...<br>
<strong>Kazumi:</strong> ...He&#x27;s already leaving.<br>
<strong>Film Director:</strong> Now I just have to figure out what to do about that action sequence... What to do... Hmm...<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...Historical costumes?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Judging by the uneven pattern on these haori, these must be Shinsengumi costumes.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> That reminds me, Asakura Mihono&#x27;s okatana, Kashuu Kiyomitsu, was once carried by Okita Souji of the Shinsengumi. It might be fitting to have her wear this haori. Speaking of the Shinsengumi--<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...Mirja?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Forget her. Just let her talk to herself.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> They gave them to us, but I&#x27;m not exactly sure what to do with them now.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> There&#x27;s only one thing to do: put it on, senpai. Wouldn&#x27;t kill you to wear it for a while, right?<br>
<strong>Kazumi:</strong> You&#x27;re being too rude. Maki-sama deserves more of your respect...<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> I&#x27;m not changing how I talk no matter who I&#x27;m talking to. And besides, don&#x27;t you wanna see senpai in that haori too?<br>
<strong>Kazumi:</strong> Th-That&#x27;s besides the...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll wear it after all. I&#x27;m no actor, so it&#x27;d be a bit embarrassing.<br>
<strong>Film Director:</strong> No, I need you to wear that haori! And, would you do me the favor of appearing in my movie!?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Wh... Where is this coming from...?<br>
<strong>Film Director:</strong> Those natural movements I saw from you, swinging your sword as you fought those aradama! That&#x27;s just what I need in this movie!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> But, I&#x27;m...<br>
<strong>Film Director:</strong> I&#x27;ve been stuck figuring out what do do with this action scene, but I realized, the answer was right in my face!<br>
<strong>Film Director:</strong> If I truly want to express the spirit of a warrior, my only choice is to borrow the talent of someone like you... I&#x27;m begging you, please!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I get where you&#x27;re coming from. Raise your head, Mr. Director.<br>
<strong>Film Director:</strong> So you&#x27;ll be in the film!?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Oh, no, I can&#x27;t act...<br>
<strong>Film Director:</strong> Oh wow, you&#x27;ve saved me! I&#x27;m so lucky to have you toji around. On top of destroying the aradama, you&#x27;re even lending your efforts to the film!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> But, I said...<br>
<strong>Film Director:</strong> There&#x27;s nothing to worry about. We&#x27;ll provide you all the support you could ask for. And anyway, that haori would look just perfect on you, I know it.<br>
<strong>Film Director:</strong> Everyone, come on over here. This toji girl said she&#x27;d be helping us out. Ah, tell the makeup and costume artists too. Here, come with me.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Ahh...<br>
<strong>Film Director:</strong> Alright, time to film something spectacular!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Kuku... Things are getting interesting &#x27;round here.<br>
<strong>Kazumi:</strong> ...Will Maki-sama truly be in a movie?<br>
Several months after the mission at the movie studio, on the movie&#x27;s opening day.</p><p><strong>Yume:</strong> I can&#x27;t wait to see Maki-onee-san&#x27;s movie~!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I never thought I&#x27;d see Maki-san&#x27;s debut on the silver screen.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Though, adjusting our schedules so the whole elite guard could be here today did give us some trouble.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Yume, Suzuka... I keep telling you, I&#x27;m not the main character or anything, remember...?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I just wanna see you show up in it, Maki-onee-san. It&#x27;ll be worth seeing for sure!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Ugh... Why didn&#x27;t I say no back then? I should just be happy Yukari-sama didn&#x27;t come to see...<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Yukari-sama was invited to a pre-screening. She should have seen it already.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> She what...?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Let&#x27;s get to the movie theater already. I want some popcorn! Come on, come on! Let&#x27;s go!<br>
