Shidou Maki and Konohana Suzuka have arrived.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Good, you&#x27;re here.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> I&#x27;ll explain to you the details concerning a great project about to be put underway.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> We received an offer from an international organization to appoint a &quot;Toji Representative&quot;, to be an ambassador of peace and goodwill toward the world.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> A toji representative...!?<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> This is a sign that the world has begun to recognize the accomplishments of toji.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> By what manner will we be deciding on the toji representative?<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> I&#x27;ve received a list of referrals for prospective candidates from each president of the Five Traditions.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> From the Minoseki Academy: Inago, Etou, Yanase, Asakura.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> From the Heijou Institute: Juujou, Iwakura, Musumi.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> From Osafune Girls&#x27; Academy: Setouchi, Kohagura, Mashiko.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> From Renpu Girls&#x27; School: Ban, Shichinosato, Itomi.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> From Ayanokouji Martial Arts School: Kitora, Yamashiro.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> From the elite guard: Shidou, Konohana, Satsuki, Tsubakuro.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> To decide on a representative from the aforementioned members, we will hold a &quot;Miss Five Traditions&quot; Selection Tournament.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> A... Miss Five Traditions Selection Tournament?<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> The judging will be divided into three categories.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> To compete in the beauty of their swordsmanship, a &quot;performance&quot;. To display a toji&#x27;s indispensable organizational skills, a &quot;group examination&quot;. To express their feelings regarding their services toward society, a &quot;speech&quot;.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> It would only be fitting to call the one who gains the most support through all categories &quot;Miss Five Traditions&quot;; someone who can act as an ambassador of spirit, vitality, and peace to the youth of the world.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> It would certainly be a total test of one&#x27;s talents as a toji then...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> As members of the elite guard, we can&#x27;t afford to give a bad example here, can we, Suzuka.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> That&#x27;s true. This is a fine opportunity to demonstrate to the public our regular dedication to improving ourselves.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> I will be there as well, on the day of the competition. I have high expectations that the nominated toji will put their best efforts.<br>
After Yukari announced the details of the &quot;Miss Five Traditions&quot; Selection Tournament, word spread in a flash among the toji.</p><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> Being an ambassador of peace toward the world sounds kinda amazing, doesn&#x27;t it!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> And also, I&#x27;m really happy everyone in the investigation team got chosen as &quot;Miss Five Traditions&quot; candidates too.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Cause, this means all the effort we&#x27;re putting in is getting recognized!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> There&#x27;s no doubt that we have gained a certain value to our reputation.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> And, at the same time &quot;Miss Five Traditions&quot; will be decided upon, the morale of toji will be raised... This is a well thought out event.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I&#x27;ll give my best shot at becoming &quot;Miss Five Traditions&quot;-! It might be tough, but, where there&#x27;s a will, there&#x27;s a way-!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Fufu. Seeing you ready to give it your all like that, I can&#x27;t let myself be outdone here.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> The selection tournament is going to have a, &quot;Badump-! A great big all girls sports day!&quot; feeling, right? I mean, of course it&#x27;ll be like that!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> You would be wrong. In the first place, they already announced the categories they will be judging us on.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> You should look over them as soon as you can, Yamashiro Yui. Every toji will likely be taking this seriously.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Yo.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Yo-, didn&#x27;t expect to run into you here.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> That reminds me, I saw the list of candidates for &quot;Miss Five Traditions&quot;.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> You were picked out for it too, weren&#x27;t you? I was surprised to see you joining in an event like this.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Yeah-. I wasn&#x27;t sure if I&#x27;d be doing it, or whatever.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Makes you want to do anything to get out of it, huh-. I get that feeling.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Hey, how about we skip the day of the tournament together?<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Y&#x27;know, I&#x27;m not into that type of half-assed attitude.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> We got picked out of the whole Five Traditions. And that means we&#x27;ve gotta put in a good showing for the rest of everybody else.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> S-Sure. Didn&#x27;t expect you to be so serious about this.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> (The higher ups didn&#x27;t put their foot down for this tournament... Which should mean it&#x27;s fine if I go.)<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> (So, why not go wild with it!)<br>
And thus, each harboring their own respective feelings, the toji came to compete for the position of &quot;Miss Five Traditions&quot;.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="2-let-the-miss-five-traditions-selection-tournament-begin"></a>2: Let the &quot;Miss Five Traditions&quot; Selection Tournament Begin!<a class="hash-link" href="#2-let-the-miss-five-traditions-selection-tournament-begin" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>And so, the day of the &quot;Miss Five Traditions&quot; Selection Tournament came.</p><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> Mmm-, today&#x27;s the perfect day for a tournament!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I&#x27;ll give it my best shot at becoming &quot;Miss Five Traditions&quot;, yeah-!<br>
<strong>Announcement:</strong> Inago Akira-san. If you have arrived at the tournament hall, please let the administrator&#x27;s office know at once--<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Huhh, so somebody&#x27;s not even here yet. Actually, that should&#x27;ve been me.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Let me hunt some aradama instead of playing along with this junk-.<br>
At that moment.</p><p><strong>Akira:</strong> Ah-... I&#x27;m for sure getting stuck in traffic here.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> And after I went outta my way to leave at a different time. No use. Guess I&#x27;ll try a back road.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> The tournament&#x27;s gonna be starting around now. I&#x27;ve gotta hurry--<br>
<strong>Announcer:</strong> Now then, the first round of judging, &quot;Performance&quot; will hereby begin.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Alright, it&#x27;s finally starting! Let&#x27;s make it a good competition, guys!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah! I&#x27;m going out there then!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> HAAAAH--!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Kanami, that&#x27;s amazing...!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Her performance is beautiful, like she&#x27;s flowing through the motions... I can&#x27;t take my eyes off her.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> But along with that, her movements look so sharp they could slice the air apart. She&#x27;s naturally gifted, isn&#x27;t she...<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> That&#x27;s how good Kanami is. But, I won&#x27;t lose.<br>
<strong>Yukina:</strong> Sayaka. Show everyone in the hall the might of Renpu Girls&#x27; School.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> I will.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> HAA--!<br>
<strong>Yukina:</strong> The toji here couldn&#x27;t possibly compete with Sayaka.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> That was a great performance, Sayaka-chan!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Thank you.<br>
<strong>Announcer:</strong> Please pardon this interruption of the judging. Inago Akira-san. If you have arrived at the tournament hall, please let the administrator&#x27;s office know at once--<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Like I figured, this way&#x27;s got hardly any traffic. I might make it only a bit late now...<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Huh? My tire popped!? I&#x27;m still nowhere near the tournament either!<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Am I supposed to push now... Damnit...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It&#x27;s going to be my turn soon... I-It&#x27;s making me nervous...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> You&#x27;ll don&#x27;t have to work yourself up over it so much, Kiyoka-chan.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> After all, this isn&#x27;t a battle, so how about you show them just how much you&#x27;ve grown?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Chie-san...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Anyway, I have to go out now. Please cheer me on.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> After the advice I gave Kiyoka-chan, as her onee-san, I&#x27;ll have to give it my best attempt.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> HAA--!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Wow, she&#x27;s incredible...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> You can do it, Chii-nee!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> From watching Chie-san&#x27;s performance, I feel like I&#x27;ve calmed down a little... But, my heart still won&#x27;t stop racing.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I have to do a performance here, in front of all these people...<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Can&#x27;t you just do whatever out there? You take this stuff so seriously.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Actually, I&#x27;m up next, aren&#x27;t I? This&#x27;s lame, so maybe I&#x27;ll bail.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Y-You&#x27;re going to leave!? Please don&#x27;t go...!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Why not. Isn&#x27;t it all the same if I&#x27;m here or not?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> But... It makes me feel, discouraged...<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Tch... Fine, whatever. I just have to go out there, right?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> What&#x27;s so fun about this waste of time... Here goes.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> That good enough for you? Aghh-, so lame.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Uwah-... Fukki, you didn&#x27;t even try at all, did you.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> It was very like her though... Ah, Kiyoka-chan&#x27;s performance is next.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> [inhale, exhale]... [inhale, exhale]...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> (Thanks to Kofuki-san, I feel like I can be a little braver...)<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> (If my friends are here with me, then I know, even I can do it...!)<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Here I go...!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ooh-... Way to go, Kiyoka!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Mm, it was a nice performance that expressed all the effort she&#x27;s put in.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> If she was gonna go and do all that, why couldn&#x27;t she just do it from the start.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah, Kofuki-san!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I was able to try my best because you stayed... Thank you very much!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Hey, I&#x27;ve got nothing to do with this.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Isn&#x27;t the last performance yours, Konohana-san? Good luck out there!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Fufu, thank you. Well then, I&#x27;ll be going.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> So in a showcase of the beauty cultivated in our swordsmanship, I&#x27;ll be last to perform...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> As an elite guard, as a toji, I can hardly put on a shameful performance now.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Konohana Suzuka will now begin-- HAAH!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Woww... Her performance is so elegant...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> When they say, &quot;to flow like water&quot;, I suppose this is exactly what they mean... What else can you expect from the elite guard.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah... With how great all the performances were, it wouldn&#x27;t be crazy if anybody won!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="3-school-separated-opposition-battle"></a>3: School Separated Opposition Battle<a class="hash-link" href="#3-school-separated-opposition-battle" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Announcer:</strong> Continuing on, everyone will be divided by their respective schools so they may display their tactics as a unit in this &quot;group examination&quot;.<br>
<strong>Announcer:</strong> Now then, ready, start!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ahahahahah! Here I go-!<br>
<strong>Toji A:</strong> Tsubakuro Yume of the elite guard is moving up quickly!<br>
<strong>Toji B:</strong> If we draw her out here, we can finish this! All members, forward!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Hmmm, so you&#x27;re trying to outnumber me. That&#x27;s fine.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I&#x27;ll tear through you one by one-- I&#x27;ll show off just what makes me so great!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> That&#x27;s our Yume. Even surrounded by toji from other schools, she treats it like it&#x27;s nothing.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Though, I feel leaving things as they are won&#x27;t give room to gauge our organizational skills.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> No need to worry about that. The strength of the elite guard isn&#x27;t just in those who push out.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> There is an ambush waiting behind the cover ahead. I&#x27;ll attack pre-emptively.<br>
<strong>Toji C:</strong> Kh, we got spotted...? Uwahhh!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Thanks, Yomi-onee-san!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> You don&#x27;t need to thank me. I only did what I needed to, as an elite guard.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Yume&#x27;s wild movements, and Yomi&#x27;s precise support of her. That&#x27;s just another part of group tactics, isn&#x27;t it?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> We can&#x27;t simply stay here admiring them either. We need to move up as well.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Right, let&#x27;s go!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> If we hold them off at the front line here, the momentum will push toward the elite guard--<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Kanami-chan, keep Tsubakuro-san back!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I&#x27;m on it-!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Onee-san!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I&#x27;m not letting you go any further, Yume-chan!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ahahah, this is fun, right!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I can see a group appraching from the south-- All members, spread out into two units!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Leave this here to Kanami-chan and perform a pincer attack to the south! Mihono-chan, take care of the other unit!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Got it-!<br>
<strong>Ema:</strong> Yanase-san is as resourceful as always. With her control over myougan, she can give commands based on her understanding of the situation in all directions.<br>
<strong>Ema:</strong> When put in charge of a raiding unit, I don&#x27;t know that any toji could get the better of her.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> The toji over there still haven&#x27;t noticed me yet...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Which means, first come, first serve-! TAAAAH-!<br>
<strong>Toji A:</strong> A-A surprise attack!?<br>
<strong>Toji B:</strong> They&#x27;re counterattacking! Intercept-!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Too late-!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Kanami and Mai are both pretty great, aren&#x27;t they... You can tell, standing on the same battlefield as them.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I can&#x27;t let them beat me either!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> The battle is becoming more chaotic... Ayanokouji&#x27;s line is falling back.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Don&#x27;t falter, Kitora Unit! Suzumoto Hana, Hasui Mayumi, take the vanguard and push the battle forward!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Nakano Jun, preserve the main unit; Yamashiro Yui, guard the rear!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Yes ma&#x27;aaam-!<br>
<strong>Yuzuki:</strong> --So they&#x27;ve rallied from a disadvantageous position.<br>
<strong>Yuzuki:</strong> Commands issued with faith in each member, arranging the unit to best make use of their skills-- Just as I&#x27;ve come to expect of you, Mirja.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Oh...? Those guys from Ayanokouji, they&#x27;ve started fighting the ones from Renpu.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Osafune Squad, take the chance to run away-. We don&#x27;t have to fight a pointless fight here.<br>
<strong>Toji A:</strong> R-Right!<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> Hey, don&#x27;t take the initiative to run when you&#x27;re the commander!<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> Though, considering it&#x27;s Kaoru, she probably won&#x27;t come away without gaining anything...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Are you sure about this, Kaoru? You&#x27;re going to get a talking to from Sana-sensei later.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> It&#x27;s fine; this is just thinking two steps ahead is all-.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> See, now Heijou Institute&#x27;s unit&#x27;s in shambles. If we move over there, we can create an opening.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> So anyway, go get &#x27;em-.<br>
<strong>Toji A:</strong> H-Huh? Osafune Unit is moving here at speed!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Please don&#x27;t think too badly of us for this. YAAA-!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> --I&#x27;m not about to let you.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Juujou-san...!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Hiyoyon!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I-I&#x27;ll back you up, Juujou-san...!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Thanks. Come on, let&#x27;s make our counterattack.<br>
<strong>Toji A:</strong> Renpu Unit is approaching from the right!<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Understood! If we can stop them here, Renpu Unit should run out of steam...<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Take a close formation with our backs to the wall! We&#x27;ll withstand this and find a good opportunity!<br>
<strong>Toji A:</strong> Right-!<br>
<strong>Iroha:</strong> That&#x27;s the way. By restricting the enemy&#x27;s space to move, you won&#x27;t be so easily broken through...<br>
<strong>Iroha:</strong> To find victory from defense is a very appropriate style of fighting for her.<br>
<strong>Ema:</strong> The state of the battle is getting awfully mixed up.<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> Now then, whose side is it going to turn in favor of?  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="4-put-your-feelings-in-your-speech"></a>4: Put Your Feelings in Your Speech<a class="hash-link" href="#4-put-your-feelings-in-your-speech" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Announcer:</strong> The third judging category will be a speech. Your speech&#x27;s theme will be: &quot;What you hope to accomplish as a toji.&quot;<br>
<strong>Announcer:</strong> Please share with us your dreams, as well as your thoughts regarding your contributions to society.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> What we hope to accomplish as toji...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> This is Shidou Maki, first seat of the elite guard.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> As a toji, what I hope to accomplish is to reach a future where everyone can laugh together.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> The threat posed by aradama still runs deep, and I understand it won&#x27;t be as simple as it sounds.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Even still, I have many allies with me here. There have been harsh battles I was able to overcome only because of the friends I had at my side.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> And, as an elite guard, I&#x27;ve come to understand how admirable it is to protect you all.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I believe a great future is waiting ahead for us... And I intend to keep walking the path toward it. That&#x27;s all. Thank you for listening.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ohh~... Shidou-san did as good as you&#x27;d expect! She&#x27;s got the attitude of a first seat-!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> That was too beautiful! I knew it; I love Maki-san too! Okay, now it&#x27;s my turn!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Good luck, Yui!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I&#x27;m Yamashiro Yui, a second year in the middle school division at Ayanokouji Martial Arts School.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> There&#x27;s something that&#x27;s been on my mind this whole time, ever since the first day I became a toji.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> And that&#x27;s... All these girls who&#x27;re toji, they&#x27;re all so cute!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> There&#x27;s good looking girls of every type, and their serious faces when they&#x27;re fighting are so dreamy... Don&#x27;t you think this situation is just too perfect?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Yui... Even in a place like this, she doesn&#x27;t change.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> And, what I enjoy most of all is getting in the baths with everyone!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I get to relax in there, charge up my energy, and we can do this and that to deepen our friendship! You know, this and that-!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Getting to be surrounded by alllll these amazing girls, I&#x27;m the happiest person in the world!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Miku. I don&#x27;t know how exactly it&#x27;ll get to you, but I know you&#x27;re going to hear this speech, won&#x27;t you?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Like you heard me say, I&#x27;m doing just fine. Because I&#x27;m having fun doing my job as a toji.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ah, about Miku, she&#x27;s my super cute little sister! That&#x27;s all-!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> That was a nice speech.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Thank you very much, Tsugumi-san!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Hello. I&#x27;m Ban Tsugumi, a second year in Renpu Girls&#x27; School&#x27;s high school division.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Ordinarily, I work with the aradama research team I&#x27;m a part of.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I compile information to build a database on aradama, and occasionally go to collect data myself.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Unlike the other girls, I may be poor at expressing myself, but I am surrounded by a supportive team and curious colleagues.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Many times have I been brought out to support these unthinkable friends of mine, however... I don&#x27;t think those days are so bad.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> In the days to come, I&#x27;d like to continue gathering much more data.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Tsugumi-san, you said you couldn&#x27;t express yourself, but... I thought you expressed yourself really well!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I know. That was a bit of humor.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Third year in middle school at the Heijou Institute. Juujou Hiyori.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> I&#x27;m honestly not very good with this sort of thing, but... I think I&#x27;ll talk a little about myself today.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Ever since I can remember, I&#x27;ve done nothing but train my skills.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> I spent my days pursuing only strength and my own ideals. I thought that would go on always.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> But, now... My days are far more fulfilling than I ever could have imagined back then.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> And that&#x27;s all because of the allies I have with me. No, I guess I should call them my friends.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Rather than only working to improve myself, I can feel that finding the time to laugh together over foolish things is just as important.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Every day I find a new side of myself that even I never realized was there.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> There will probably be lots of changes in my future, and maybe that&#x27;s what people call growing up. But I&#x27;m also looking forward to seeing what &quot;new me&quot; will come next.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Nn~, that was a good speech, Hiyoyon! I&#x27;m going to have to try to to be outdone!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Ah-, test, test. I&#x27;m Kohagura Ellen, a first year in high school at Osafune Girls&#x27; Academy!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> This has to do with the theme of, &quot;what you hope to accomplish as a toji,&quot; but I&#x27;m going to start with a quick story.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> When I was little, I always couldn&#x27;t wait to hear what stories Grandma would tell me.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> With a dream forming in my young heart, you could say it was only natural I would yearn to see the Japan filled with wonders I had heard about.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> And, when I came to Japan... It was a wonderland even greater than I had pictured! I felt inspired by the okatana wielding toji--<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> And, seeing up close the friendship that could be formed between people and aradama, I thought, how fantastic is that!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> The dream I&#x27;ve always had was to make an aradama park and tours of the netherworld a reality.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> It might be a faraway dream at this point, but I&#x27;ll absolutely make it come true someday!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Everyone&#x27;s speeches are so great...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Just from listening to them, I&#x27;ve feeling hyped up too!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Okay, Mihomiho. You&#x27;re the last to go!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Right-!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Umm, I&#x27;m Asakura Mihono, a second year in middle school at the Minoseki Academy.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> This might seem out of nowhere, but my motto is, &quot;Leap before you look!&quot;<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> With my job as a toji, and with this okatana... I&#x27;ve done my best so far thinking I might have the power to make somebody happy.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I&#x27;ve seen lots of tough enemies, and been through lots of close calls.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> But, during those times, what kept me going was one thought deep in my heart.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I don&#x27;t know how to say anything that sounds great yet. But, still!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Maybe I can&#x27;t understand all the hard stuff, but I&#x27;ll keep trying my best every day!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Whatever trouble I run into, together with my friends, I&#x27;ve been able to leap before I look out of it.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> From now on, so long as I&#x27;m with everyone, I know I&#x27;ll be able to go as far as I can-- Because I believe, &quot;where there&#x27;s a will, there&#x27;s a way!&quot;<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> You stole it away at the end, Mihono-chan. That hit the spot!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> True. The volume of the applause shows you just how much the audience expects of Asakura Mihono.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="5-whose-hand-will-take-the-glory"></a>5: Whose Hand Will Take the Glory<a class="hash-link" href="#5-whose-hand-will-take-the-glory" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>After all the judging had been concluded, the toji each waited for the results to be announced.</p><p><strong>Kanami:</strong> You all did great, everybody-!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> You too. We&#x27;ve done all we can now.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> It&#x27;s good we were able to have such a satisfying tournament, since we did the best we could with our current ability.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> It was neat getting to learn things about each other I never knew before too!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> I get the feeling I talked a bit too much though...<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Really? I thought it was great to hear.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> This whole tournament was just an excuse to get us to work unpaid overtime, wasn&#x27;t it-. Feels like working over the weekend.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Now now, Kaoru. Making wonderful memories like these is priceless.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Sayaka-chan, good work on your performance. You must be hungry, aren&#x27;t you?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm, a little.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I baked cookies, so here. If you&#x27;d all like, why don&#x27;t we all share them together?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Can we? Thanks, Mai-chan! I&#x27;ll have some-!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Sigh, that&#x27;s fiiinally over with. Oi, get some aradama-chan ready for me.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Understood. Please give me a moment.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You two have gone right back to usual, haven&#x27;t you.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Umm-, aren&#x27;t you curious about the results being announced?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Yeah right. It&#x27;s not like I even planned on becoming &quot;Miss Five Traditions&quot; in the first place.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> What about if you were chosen, Tsugumi-san...?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> It would cut into the time I have for research, so I would want to turn it down.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> (That&#x27;s how they both are... But, if I were chosen, what would I do...?)<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> (It&#x27;s no use! After all, I know someone like me could never become &quot;Miss Five Traditions&quot;... But, still~...!)<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Who do you think it&#x27;ll be-; &quot;Miss Five Traditions!&quot;<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> They&#x27;d probably get a bunch of cute outfits and things for her, right?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I doubt those would be anything like the outfits you&#x27;re imagining, Yamashiro Yui.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Mihono-chan, with how good your speech was, you might even be picked to be &quot;Miss Five Traditions&quot;.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ehh-, you think so? But, everybody else&#x27;s were great too, and yours was amazing, Chii-nee, so I think it wouldn&#x27;t be weird if anybody won!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> What&#x27;d really make me happy is if somebody from the investigation team ended up getting picked as the winner!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah-, now that I&#x27;m thinking about it, my heart won&#x27;t stop pounding. I can&#x27;t wait to see the results-!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Fufu, I know what you mean... Oh?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Look, outside. A girl is pushing a motorcycle up.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> [pant, pant]... I&#x27;m here, damnit...<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Though, it&#x27;ll for sure be over at this point... Aghh-...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Hmmm, I wonder if I showed off enough to the judges.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Sure you did. Though, while appealing to the judges is important for getting chosen to be &quot;Miss Five Traditions&quot;, your general accomplishments as a toji are also taken into account.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Considering the toji that were entered in the competition, everyone should still have a chance.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I&#x27;ve done all that I can. The rest is in the hands of fate.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Everyone, I&#x27;ve prepared omusubi if you&#x27;d like.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Yaaay, I&#x27;ll have some-!<br>

<strong>Mihono:</strong> Or something like that!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Fine by me?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Then, I&#x27;ll make us some food.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Chii-nee&#x27;s gonna cook!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...But wait, why don&#x27;t we just go do karaoke?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I do want to eat Chii-nee&#x27;s cooking, but I want it to be something more casual and fun where we can let loose.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Fufu, you&#x27;re just being considerate. Karaoke, hm. I&#x27;ll look forward to it.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> That&#x27;s right, I&#x27;ll have to tune my throat beforehand.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I can&#x27;t wait to hear Mirja-san&#x27;s singing! Let&#x27;s sing a duet together!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Are you only going to be inviting the investigation team?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Since we&#x27;re doing this, I want to reach out to Kanami and them too.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It would be more fun with everyone going, won&#x27;t it? I&#x27;ll talk to Juujou-san.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Then, I&#x27;ll ask Kaoru-san and Ellen-san. Tsugumi-san, can you speak to Itomi-san about it?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Understood. I&#x27;ll ask Itomi-san.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Alright-, Kiyoka, Yui, Fukki-! Let&#x27;s go do karaoke now! We&#x27;ve gotta build up our stock of songs!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Wait, that was what we talked about, so why&#x27;d it turn into a party at such a fancy place!?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I heard the elite guard and Yukari-sama found out about it, and it sounds like Yukari-sama decided to hold a great big party to thank everyone.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Our karaoke meetup turned into a real party!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Hey, Kanami! Since Yukari-sama did this, that means she had to have gotten some yummy food for us, right!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Mmmm, I can&#x27;t wait!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I know what you mean, Mihono-chan.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Kanami-chan, Mihono-chan, it seems like they have dresses ready for us over there.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> She got us dresses too!? Let&#x27;s go quick, Kanami!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah, wait up, Mihono-chan!?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> You don&#x27;t have to be in such a rush you two; they have enough for everyone...<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> They&#x27;re already gone.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mai?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Oh, Sayaka-chan.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Kanami and Mihono were running. Did something happen?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Nothing&#x27;s happened, you don&#x27;t have to worry. More importantly, what did you need?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> I came to get you.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Thank you. I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing the dresses.<br>

<strong>Mihono:</strong> Huh, did somebody come back? I&#x27;m coming-.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Chii-nee and Mai?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> I thought, if you were still getting ready, I could give a hand, but... It looks like you&#x27;re fine.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> You look like you&#x27;re finished too, Sayaka-chan.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> ...Mmhm, you look very cute.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Thank you, Mai.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mihono put this necklace on for me.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I see; Wasn&#x27;t that nice of her.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> So you were late because you were helping Itomi-san finish up.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> There was that too, but it&#x27;s mostly because I couldn&#x27;t decide what earrings to go with. What do you think of these?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> I like them; they look great on you, Mihono-chan.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ehehe, I&#x27;m glad to hear it then!
