Engaging in combat!<br><strong>Subordinate A:</strong> Shidou-san! You're pushing too far ahead! You're our captain, so please don't be so risky!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> It's because I'm the captain that I need to take the lead. I couldn't stand seeing any of my girls get hurt.<br><strong>Subordinate:</strong> B: Shidou-san! There's a giant aradama approaching from the northeast!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> What!? ...This one seems difficult.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> I'll manage that one by myself. The rest of you, get rid of the aradama in the surrounding area.<br><strong>Subordinate A:</strong> Are you serious!? That's too much for anyone to fight alone!!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Don't worry. Have faith in me!ã€€  
<strong>Maki:</strong> Nice job. It's thanks to all your efforts that we were able to finish this without casualties.<br><strong>Subordinate A:</strong> We only stayed safe because you took care of that dangerous aradama all by yourself, Shidou-san.<br><strong>Subordinate B:</strong> Your strength is on a completely different level than ours. That's why I admire you so much, Shidou-san.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> I have to be. I'm the captain, after all.<br><strong>Subordinate A:</strong> I love how humble you can be about your accomplishments too...<br><strong>Subordinate B:</strong> Shidou-san's smoother than any guy, isn't she...<br><strong>Subordinate C:</strong> Sigh... You're such a ladykiller, Shidou-san...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> --Good work, Maki-san. It seems you've accomplished quite a lot again today.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> And you're as popular as ever among the girls of your unit.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> It'd be bad if the captain wasn't popular, you know.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I believe it's a slightly different sort of popularity than you think, though.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> (Maki-san can truly be dense about that sort of thing. Fufufu. Well, that may also be part of the reason behind her popularity.)  </p><h2 id="2-shidou-makis-resolve" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>2: Shidou Maki's Resolve</h2><p><strong>Maki:</strong> Excuse me, Yukari-sama. It's Shidou Maki. Starting today, I'll be in your care as the first seat of the elite guard.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> --Enter.<br><strong>Subordinate A:</strong> --GYAAAA-!!<br><strong>Subordinate B:</strong> Somebody... Somebody, help me!!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Just hold on! I'll stop the aradama--<br><strong>Subordinate C:</strong> Shidou-san! It's too much for you to do anything about! I hate it too, but we need to escape!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> How can you say that!? Those are our comrades at its feet!!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> As the captain, I refuse to leave any of them behind!!<br><strong>Subordinate C:</strong> Please, get a hold of yourself!! With the way that aradama struck them down, it's already too late for them!!<br><strong>Subordinate C:</strong> If you don't give the order to retreat now, the whole unit will be wiped out!!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> --Shit!! I'm supposed to be their captain...!!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> But if I had the strength for it, this never should have happened...!!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> --On that day, many from my unit were badly wounded.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> They had such promising futures, and yet, with no hope of recovery, they had to be retired.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> I'll never forget the helplessness I felt back then. Not a moment has gone by that it hasn't agonized me.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Justice is meaningless without the strength to back it up- Without the power to protect.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> To protect the people at your side. If I can reach that power... I don't care if it comes from heaven or hell.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Today, as the first seat of Yukari-sama's elite guard, I'll allow myself to be injected with noro.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> I hate the idea of letting noro in my body, but it's better than losing my comrades again. Than seeing the tears that were shed that day again.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Under Yukari-sama, I swear I'll purge every last aradama from the face of the earth...!!  </p><h2 id="3-makis-lecture" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>3: Maki's Lecture</h2><p><strong>Maki:</strong> Yume. We need to talk.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> The other day, you were ordered to lead a unit on a mission. But I heard you got carried away in battle and left them on their own?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Without their captain around, your subordinates will fall into chaos. Don't forget your duty as their leader.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> But that's not my problem! They should all be able to take care of themselves!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> That's not what it means to be captain, you know.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> I've received some complaints from the toji you worked with. I'm going to read them now, so pay attention.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> --Captain Tsubakuro abandoned us in the middle of battle chasing an aradama. She didn't return for another hour.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> --On top of abandoning us, Captain Tsubakuro did not respond to our attempts to contact her. It was difficult to continue without being given orders.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> --Please, Captain Tsubakuro, I'm begging you. Don't go running off with aradama you don't know.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Well of course I didn't know that aradama! I don't know any aradama!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Besides, those girls are way too needy~! If the captain's gone, then everyone can just be their own captain!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> YOU COMPLETE IDIOT!!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Hya!?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> ...Even I've put people in danger by pushing too far ahead.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> But that's no excuse not to reflect on your mistakes. Don't try to pass your responsibility onto them.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> If you're going to keep putting your unit in danger, then you won't be assigned missions anymore.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> You always say you want everyone to remember how amazing you are, but at this rate they'll only remember you as a failure.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> No! I don't want that!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> ...Everyone already knows just how strong you are, Yume. You should show them what a capable leader you can be too!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> ...Oh... I got it!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Then, next time I'm in charge, I'll fight all the aradama myself! Then they'll see how capable I am!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> It's hard to even call that a unit at this point...  </p><h2 id="4-the-overworking-subordinate" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>4: The Overworking Subordinate</h2><p><strong>Watanuki Kazumi:</strong> --Maki-sama. I've finished writing the report you entrusted me with. Would you like to go over it?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Of course. Sorry to keep relying on you like this.<br><strong>Kazumi:</strong> Think nothing of it. In fact, I'm grateful you would let me work on something Yukari-sama herself would read.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> ......Hmm. Alright, I'm done. It's very well written.<br><strong>Kazumi:</strong> Of course. After you assigned it to me, I wouldn't settle for anything less than perfect.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Thanks. You're so reliable, Kazumi.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> ...By the way, I couldn't help but notice the bags under your eyes. Did you have to stay up late working on this?<br><strong>Kazumi:</strong> Please, pay it no mind. I only went one night without sleeping.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> You pulled an all-nighter!? There's not much left to do today, so please, go back to your room and sleep.<br><strong>Kazumi:</strong> No, I wouldn't have had to stay up all night if not for my inexperience.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> ...Kazumi, don't overwork yourself. It's a bad habit of yours to push yourself harder than you have to.<br><strong>Kazumi:</strong> No, I can still--<br><strong>Kazumi:</strong> (I have to give everything I can. It's the only way I can be useful to Maki-sama...)<br><strong>Kazumi:</strong> --We've been called to action. Aradama have appeared, it seems. Maki-sama, let's go.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Stay here, Kazumi.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> If you won't rest, I'll have to punish myself for poorly managing you.<br><strong>Kazumi:</strong> You'd punish yourself over me...<br><strong>Kazumi:</strong> I understand. If you insist, I'll get some rest... You're so kind, Maki-sama.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> You're my precious subordinate, after all.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Anyway, I'm going. You be sure to get some sleep in your room.<br><strong>Kazumi:</strong> Maki-sama... I dream of one day being able to stand by your side the way Konohana-sama does.  </p><h2 id="5-absolute-trust" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>5: Absolute Trust</h2><p><strong>Maki:</strong> --Hey, Suzuka. Have you seen my phone anywhere?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> It's over on the desk.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Ah, you're right. I guess I left it in the office.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I can't believe you... You're too careless. What if someone had taken for some wrongdoing?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Wrongdoing? The only people allowed in here are those authorized by the elite guard.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Ara, but what if I decided to play a prank on you?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> You wouldn't do something like that. After all the hardships we've been through together, I know I can count on you.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> --There was that time we were separated from the others and had to fight off aradama together for quite some time, wasn't there.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Yeah. We didn't even have enough provisions, so we had to share a meal. I remember thinking at the time that, no matter what happened after, I could always trust you to watch my back.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yes. At the time, I also decided you were worth relying on as a fighter and a person.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> --On a somewhat related note. I did play a little prank on you, because of our closeness.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> After all, I know you'll forgive me, Maki-san, if I get a little mischievous with you.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> You shouldn't abuse someone's trust like that...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Fufu. Anyway, are you aware I know the password to your phone?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Eh-!? How!?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> You always hold your phone horizontally, so watching you input it was child's play.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> I-I didn't know you were watching... And hey, isn't it common courtesy not to watch someone put their password in?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> I mean, I don't know your phone's password, Suzuka.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> You just aren't very observant, Maki-san.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> That's still not a good reason...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Anyway, jokes aside, I wanted to show how you never know what risks you may be taking.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> To begin with, an emergency call could come in at any time, so you ought to always keep your phone with you.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> ...You have a point there. I'll be more careful from now on.<br><div><iframe width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AuF8ZqOvA9Y"></iframe></div>  </p><h2 id="vrs-equipment---maki-start-just-to-be-sure" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[VRS Equipment - Maki: Start]: Just to Be Sure</h2><p><strong>Yume:</strong> Found you, Maki-onee-san!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Yume, what do you need? I thought you had the day off today.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Don't you have it off too, Maki-onee-san? Hey hey-, since we have free time, don't you want to play a game together?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> A game?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Some toji onee-sans made a VR game in their lab, and people are saying it's super fun.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> VR... I think I'll have to turn you down this time.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh, you should go-. They said it's really easy to play too, so you'll be fine even though you're dumb with technology, Maki-onee-san.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> I-I wasn't worried about that...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Then, Maki-san, since you have this opportunity on your day off, why not go and play with Yume?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> ...Doesn't seem like I have much of a choice. If you don't mind me acting as a chaperone, then I'll go.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Yaay! I get to go out with Maki-onee-san! That makes me happy. Let's get going then-!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I'm surprised to see two of the elite guard arrive. It might be unexpected, but I'm glad you're here. I'll have two stations ready for you right away.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Hang on a minute, I'm only here to chaperone her.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh-, but we're already here, so you should just do it too, Maki-onee-san-!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> But...<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> If you're concerned with the safety of it, you have nothing to worry about. Fighting within the game should be safer than your ordinary battles with aradama.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Well, I can't argue with that...<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> By the way, we're currently hosting an event. Whoever can score highest in the battle stage will be given a prize of cream puffs from a popular store.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ahh! That's that store Suzuka-onee-san loves, isn't it! Hey hey, Maki-onee-san, if you win, then won't Suzuka-onee-san be really happy?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> You should play for Suzuka-onee-san too-.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> ...I guess, if I have to. Fine, if I'm doing this, then I'll aim for the top!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Hooray-! Let's try our best, Maki-onee-san!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> There, now everything is ready... Hm? Shidou-san, why are you holding your okatana?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Since I'm going to a strange world fighting unknown enemies, I want to take every precaution.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I see. Though, in this game, you'll be battling with laser guns, so your okatana won't be necessary... But, if it gives you peace of mind, that's okay.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Now then, let's start the game. Take care.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Wow-! So this is the game world! The city's all pretty and shiny!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Let's go on the roof of that building! Juuump!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Yume, wait for me! Okay, I'll do it too... EII!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> This is amazing! The game world improved our jumping ability by this much. I can leap from building to building like I were using hachimanriki.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Maki-onee-san! Let's go up to the top of that tower!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Sure, let's go!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Ahh, the city skyline at night really is beautiful. I wish Suzuka and them could be here to see this...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> ...Huh? Yume?

Where did you go? Say something back. Yume-!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Hm, that sound. The battle stage must be starting. If I follow the enemies, maybe I'll join up with Yume. I'll focus on the battle for now.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> If I remember right, the command to bring out the laser gun was... Okay, I got it. Now I just point it at the enemies on the opposite building...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Kh, why can't I pull the trigger!? The command to pull the trigger was...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Ah-- While I was working with it, the enemies got right in front of me! Damn, how should I...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Ah--! That's right, I still have that, don't I! It might be tasteless of me to use my okatana in the game, but...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Here I come! SERYAAAAAAAAAAAAA!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Good! I can defeat them with my okatana too. I'll keep this up and wipe them out! HAAAAAAHH!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh-- Hey, Maki-onee-san?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Yume! That's good, you're safe! I'll finish them all off in a minute! HAAAAAAHH!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Come on-, Maki-onee-san! It's a game, so fight with your laser gun already-.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> An okatana seems to be what suits me best after all. Alright, this should finish them! YAAAAAAHH!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Alright, battle stage clear. Good work, Yume.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I wasn't working at all-. You beat them all by yourself out of nowhere, Maki-onee-san.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> I see, sorry about that. Anyway, how about we enjoy a look around the city now?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Okay!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Welcome back. Did you two have a good time?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Yeah! Maki-onee-san beat everything in the battle stage first, so I didn't get to do anything, but it was a lot of fun jumping around between the buildings-.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> It was. The virtual world was more detailed than I imagined, and it was satisfying seeing every nook and cranny of the city.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> That's good to hear. Now then, as all challengers have finished their runs, the results of the battle stage will now be revealed.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Maki-onee-san beat them all straight away, so there's no way she didn't take first place!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> That's right, I got serious hoping for that. Let's see the rankings.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> What!? We came in last place!?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Eh-!? But why? We should've been first in beating the most enemies and beating them fastest. Why are we last-?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> At first, I was just as perplexed as to why you two didn't earn any points in the battle...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> When investigating the cause, we came to the conclusion that there was a problem with how you defeated the enemies.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Did you use something besides the laser gun to defeat them?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Kh... So you don't get any points for defeating them with okatana...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> We're back-!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> ...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Welcome back, the two of you. Oh, Maki-san, what's the matter? That's an awfully gloomy look on your face.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> You still can't get over that we lost, Maki-onee-san? Cheer up, okay-.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Th-That's not it. It's just... I planned on coming back with Suzuka's favorite cream puffs, but instead...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Well now, is that why you're in such low spirits. Fufu. Maki-san, please lift up your head.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I would be happy to have those cream puffs, but your feelings alone are enough to satisfy me.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Suzuka...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Next time, I'd like for all of us to go play that game together.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Right, sure thing.

It's just...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Just?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> It's just a little hard to calm down.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Doesn't that mean you're getting nervous?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> ...Maybe. I guess you're right.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> That's how you are, Maki-san.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> It's because we can't stop for anything until we atone for the past.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> You aren't entirely wrong to think that way, but... If you obsess over it, you'll only be making yourself suffer, alright?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> I know that, but, still.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> You're very serious, Maki-san.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> That's just how I am; I can't help it.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> By the way...

But, it's impressive, wasn't it?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> So it just crossed my mind.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I do agree it's an interesting idea. I'll see if I can think of anything too.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> A PV?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yes. A promotional video for toji, with a play staged in VR.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> A play...?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I called it that, but we won't actually be acting out roles.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Something more of a staged sword fight, you could call it.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> When I consulted with Ban-san, she said it would be feasible, so long as she recorded the fighting and edited the footage.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> So she just needs us to fight then... Alright, that plan sounds good.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> We should be able to make it happen.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I've already given Ban-san the go ahead.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> You always get things rolling.
