class="hash-link" href="#1-meeting-maki" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Maki:</strong> So you&#x27;re the new addition to the elite guard, Tsubakuro Yume?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I&#x27;m Shidou Maki, the first seat. We&#x27;ll be working together from now on. Let&#x27;s get along.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Onee-san, you won Yukari-sama&#x27;s tournament twice, right? So you must be really strong. We should fight!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Right off the bat, huh. Looks like our new recruit&#x27;s a lively one.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> But unfortunately, I can&#x27;t right now. There&#x27;s an aradama suppression mission I need to help with.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Then I&#x27;ll go with you. We&#x27;ll have a fight to see who can beat the most aradama!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> You mean a competition to see who has the highest aradama killcount?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Sounds interesting enough, but without orders to let you come, I can&#x27;t let you join my unit.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh-!? Just for a little while! If you won&#x27;t let me, I&#x27;m gonna follow you anyway, okay!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Geez, a real lively kid after all... Well, since you&#x27;re strong enough to make it into the elite guard, you should be able to handle yourself out there.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Yeah, yeah! I&#x27;ll be super useful, actually! So let&#x27;s compete! C&#x27;mon, compete with me!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ...Alright. It seems like a good chance to see what the new recruit&#x27;s capable of. Okay, I&#x27;ll accept your challenge!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Hooray-! After I beat you, Maki onee-san, I&#x27;ll be the first seat!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> There-! That&#x27;s the last aradama down-!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> You were incredible, Yume. You must have taken out half the aradama on this mission by yourself.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ehehe! So that means I won, right?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Yep. I didn&#x27;t get anywhere near as many as you.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Hooray-! I beat Maki onee-san-!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I&#x27;m surprised by just how strong you are at your age. With you around, the elite guard has a bright future.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> So since I beat you, Maki onee-san, that makes me the first seat now, doesn&#x27;t it!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Well no, the seats just show the order everyone joined in. So no matter how strong you are, you&#x27;re the fourth seat, Yume.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Huhh!? Really!? I tried so hard, but it&#x27;s like I still lost-! You should have made it clearer from the start! Sheesh-!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="2-shopping-with-yume"></a>2: Shopping with Yume<a class="hash-link" href="#2-shopping-with-yume" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Yume:</strong> Yaaay! We all managed to go shopping together in Harajuku today-!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> You were very insistent. But I still don&#x27;t understand why you wanted me to come...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Because it&#x27;s more fun with more people!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> What a fancy looking shop. Yume, you wanted to buy your Ichigo Daifuku Neko goods here, didn&#x27;t you?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Yeah! Stickers for my scabbard, and stuffed animals!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Just be aware of how much money you have to spend.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Okaaay! Let&#x27;s see, I&#x27;ll get three of this stuffed animal, so I can have each color...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Oh, but I don&#x27;t have enough money to get more than one...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> They&#x27;re just different colors. One should be enough.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Okay... But they&#x27;re all so cute. I don&#x27;t know which one to buy...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ...Well, if you can&#x27;t make up your mind, I&#x27;ll have to buy one of them.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Really!? Thank you, Maki onee-san!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> You&#x27;re too soft on her, Maki-san... I suppose that leaves me no choice but to buy another one.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Hooray! That means I can have all of them now! I love you, onee-sans!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> A stuffed animal is a small price to pay to see you looking so delighted, Yume.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Anyway, is there anything else you need? We all came out to Harajuku together, so I&#x27;ll help you buy whatever you want.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I only wanted stickers and the stuffed animals today, so I don&#x27;t need to buy anything else!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> O-Okay, if you&#x27;re fine with that...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> --Ah! I know just the thing!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> If that&#x27;s all you wanted here, why don&#x27;t we stop by that ice cream shop?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> It seems they offer waffle cones? I&#x27;ll pay for yours!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I like the sound of that. I&#x27;ll go order a triple scoop.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Hey, Maki-san! Please don&#x27;t go stealing your way into my idea!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Well, the one I&#x27;ll be getting is a triple scoop of chocolate mint, anyway. Ahahaha.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Eww, that stuff tastes like toothpaste though! I don&#x27;t want any-!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ...Shidou-san and Konohana-san are like an old couple spoiling their grandchild...  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="3-yumes-unreasonable-request"></a>3: Yume&#x27;s Unreasonable Request<a class="hash-link" href="#3-yumes-unreasonable-request" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Yume:</strong> Sigh... This is so boring... Yukari-sama&#x27;s gone, and the other guards won&#x27;t play with me...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Hey-, hey-, Kazumi onee-san and Wakako onee-san. Tell me a funny story.<br>
<strong>Wakako:</strong> Eh-!? I can&#x27;t come up with anything when you ask so suddenly...!<br>
<strong>Kazumi:</strong> I&#x27;m sorry. Nothing comes to mind.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh~!? You two&#x27;re so lame~! Hmm, then... Tell me if you two have a crush on anyone!<br>
<strong>Wakako:</strong> Ehh!? W-We don&#x27;t have to tell you that...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Huh, what&#x27;s that? The way you reacted says you do have a crush on someone, right, Wakako onee-san?<br>
<strong>Wakako:</strong> Ugh...! ...N-No comment.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Hmm? Fine, be that way. Now it&#x27;s your turn, Kazumi onee-san!<br>
<strong>Kazumi:</strong> Maki-sama is the one I long for.<br>
<strong>Wakako:</strong> Without any hesitation!?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Eh-! So Kazumi onee-san likes Maki onee-san!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> --Now back to you, Wakako onee-san. Who do you like? Is it someone I know?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> If you don&#x27;t say who, I&#x27;ll use my position as the fourth seat of the elite guard to get you fired~.<br>
<strong>Wakako:</strong> Ughh...!?<br>
<strong>Wakako:</strong> (I&#x27;d rather die than say who, but to get fired over such a reason...)<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> --Hey, Yume! Stop bothering them!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ah, Maki onee-san!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I can&#x27;t believe you. Whenever you don&#x27;t have a mission, you just go around annoying people. This causes trouble for me too, you know?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> But I&#x27;m so bored!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Really? If you&#x27;re that bored, then I&#x27;ll have you cleaning the office daily from now on. I was just looking for someone to take care of that.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh-!? No way! I don&#x27;t wanna have to clean the office!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I know a few other places you can clean then. The entrance hall, the hallways, the bathrooms, and then there&#x27;s...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> ...I&#x27;m leaving-!!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> She ran away, huh.<br>
<strong>Wakako:</strong> --You scared her off.<br>
<strong>Kazumi:</strong> You&#x27;re so dependable, Maki-sama.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="4-yumes-adult-appeal"></a>4: Yume&#x27;s Adult Appeal<a class="hash-link" href="#4-yumes-adult-appeal" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Yume:</strong> Aghh-! She told me again that I can&#x27;t go on a mission because I&#x27;m a kid!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> This is so boring! Even though I&#x27;m the strongest in the elite guard...!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I&#x27;ll just have to show Yukari-sama I can be as adult as anyone else!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> But how do I do that... If I put on makeup, that&#x27;d make me look more adult, right?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> --I know! I&#x27;ll just ask the other guards!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> ...So anyway, what do you all think I need to do to be an adult?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Starting with Yomi onee-san, what&#x27;s your idea!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ...An adult is someone who pays taxes, aren&#x27;t they?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> That&#x27;s certainly a very grounded view of it...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> But I can agree with that.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Well that&#x27;s easy! I&#x27;ll make sure to pay taxes! Now it&#x27;s your turn, Suzuka onee-san!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Being an adult is about the way you speak, isn&#x27;t it?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yume speaks in a very childish manner. You should at least speak more respectfully around Yukari-sama.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> That&#x27;s right. I&#x27;d be interested in seeing you try it too.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Hm, hmm... Last up, Maki onee-san!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Normally, you&#x27;d think someone&#x27;s a kid because of their height, right?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> But Yume can&#x27;t exactly go about changing that in a single day.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Though if she wears high heels, it could make a slight difference.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Let&#x27;s see... So if I put together all your ideas...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I just need to go to Yukari-sama wearing high heels, and ask something like &quot;Would you please examine this?&quot; while showing her proof I paid taxes!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> You should really just give up on this.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="5-yume-vs-kanami"></a>5: Yume vs Kanami<a class="hash-link" href="#5-yume-vs-kanami" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Yume:</strong> --I finally get to fight you, Onee-san. I&#x27;ve been waiting so long for this.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> You&#x27;re the one from the elite guard we fought before...! What are you doing here...?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Wanna fight me, Onee-san? I think you&#x27;re probably stronger than anyone.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> So if I beat you, no one will be able to forget how amazing I am!<br>
<strong>Kanam:</strong> ...Mm, okay. I wanted to settle things with you anyway.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Then let&#x27;s get started right now!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> --Hah!!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> So aggressive...! And those pointed strikes...! This is some advanced Ten&#x27;nen Rishin-Ryu!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ahahahaha-! You&#x27;re having fun, right-!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah! You&#x27;re really interesting! Now it&#x27;s my turn--<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Haaaaaahh-!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Pant... Pant... ...It&#x27;s no good. Whatever I do, I can&#x27;t beat you, Onee-san.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> You&#x27;re so strong though, Yume-chan! Fighting you was so much fun!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> ...Mm. I had a lot of fun fighting you too, Onee-san!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> By the way, those stickers and that strap on your scabbard are super cute! That&#x27;s Ichigo Daifuku Neko, right?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Yeah! My onee-sans in the elite guard bought them for me!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Do you like Ichigo Daifuku Neko too?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I love it! I like anything that&#x27;s cute!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Really! Then you should come shopping with me next time!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Okay! Sounds like fun! I&#x27;ll invite Mai-chan and Mihono-chan, and we can all go together!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> ...Hey, Onee-san. If we met differently, would we have been friends?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Of course we would have! And rivals too!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> If we went to school together, I&#x27;d challenge you to fights every day! I can&#x27;t wait to see more of your swordsmanship!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> School together... Huh. Fufu... That sounds really fun.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> But that&#x27;s why... It&#x27;s too bad... It makes it even worse...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> What&#x27;s so bad about it? It&#x27;s not too late, you know! We can still be friends!<br>

<strong>Maki:</strong> Sweet sake...? That sure would warm us right up.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Since we have the opportunity, we may as well take some. I&#x27;ll go with you, Yomi-san.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> W-Wait, wait, wait! Sweet sake&#x27;s no good!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Oh, do you not like sweet sake? Perhaps we can find something else for you, Yume.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> That&#x27;s not what I meant! It&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t want it; it&#x27;s you onee-sans who can&#x27;t have it!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> But I don&#x27;t dislike sweet sake?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> You don&#x27;t understand... Aghh, the shrine visit!  Let&#x27;s just do the shrine visit already, before more people show up!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Sigh~, we&#x27;re finally done~.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Was that really enough? You hardly prayed for more than three seconds.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> That&#x27;s all I needed. I didn&#x27;t want to wish for anything from the gods anyway.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Anyhow, Maki-onee-san and Suzuka-onee-san sure are taking their time~.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> About those two, they asked me to tell you they went looking to buy charms.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Charms? ...Hehe, then this works out great. Come with me for a minute, Yomi onee-san!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Now&#x27;s our chance to get something to eat from the stalls!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> We&#x27;re buying something from the stalls?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Yup! What should we get~? Do you know what Maki-onee-san and Suzuka-onee-san like?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I don&#x27;t. Come to think of it, what do they like to eat?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Yomi-onee-san, I can&#x27;t count on you for anything~. Oh well, maybe strawberry mochi will work~.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I don&#x27;t think anyone is selling strawberry mochi... Why did you want to know what the two of them like to eat?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Hehehe, that&#x27;s a secret for now~... Oh, I got a great idea! I&#x27;ll just buy some of everything, and you can help me carry it all, Yomi onee-san.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Sorry for the wait... Why do you have all that?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Your arms are full with... Is that food?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Yup. I&#x27;m giving all these to you onee-sans, as a gift.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> A gift?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Thank you, onee-sans. If it weren&#x27;t for you two, we wouldn&#x27;t be able to do our first shrine visit together.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="furisode-part-2-thank-you"></a>Furisode Part 2: Thank You<a class="hash-link" href="#furisode-part-2-thank-you" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Yume:</strong> Thank you, onee-sans.

<strong>Maki:</strong> It&#x27;s rare hearing you say thanks...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Come on! Just listen to me!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Maki-san, give Yume a chance to talk.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> You&#x27;re right. Sorry Yume. I didn&#x27;t mean to make fun of you.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I&#x27;m talking about something serious here, okay?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I know. I&#x27;ll hear what you have to say. So Yume, what are you thanking us for?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Geez, you&#x27;re so dense~.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> It&#x27;s because of you onee-sans that I got to do my first shrine visit this year!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> That&#x27;s why, thanks. It&#x27;s really fun, visiting the shrine with you!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ...I see, I&#x27;m having fun too, Yume.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> And I as well.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> That&#x27;s good then~. Here! Have as much as you want!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Since Yume went out of her way to buy all this for us, why don&#x27;t we find somewhere quiet to enjoy it.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I actually wanted to secretly buy the things you liked, but... I didn&#x27;t know what to get, so I just bought a whole lot of stuff.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Fufu, that&#x27;s very like you. Thank you, Yume.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> There&#x27;s nothing I&#x27;d like more than whatever you&#x27;d buy for me.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Why are you the one thanking me? That&#x27;s weird, isn&#x27;t it? I mean, I&#x27;m the one who should be thankful.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> No, let me say it too. Thank you for being here to visit the shrine with us, Yume.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Why are you thanking me now, Maki-onee-san!? This is weird, right? Yomi-onee-san!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ...I&#x27;m the only one who hasn&#x27;t said anything. Thank you all. Shidou-san, Konohana-san, Tsubakuro-san.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Not you too, Yomi-onee-san!?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Fufu. You want to go flower viewing again this year as well, don&#x27;t you, Yume?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Nn, I want to go, but... No sweet sake this time, okay?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ...Fireworks, maybe at the summer festival, would be nice too, wouldn&#x27;t it? I&#x27;d rather see them together than alone this time.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Fireworks!? I really wanna see that!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Isn&#x27;t there anything you want to do this year, Tsubakuro-san?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> What I want to do...? Oh yeah! Seeing the autumn leaves!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Understood. We can all go together.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> And, what else~. I still have to beat Yukari-sama, so a whole bunch of people can see how great I am!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> There&#x27;s a lot you want to do, isn&#x27;t there. Shouldn&#x27;t you have wished to the gods about it then?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh~? I don&#x27;t have to do that~. Cause... The four of us can make it all happen together!  </p><div class="videoWrapper"><iframe width="640" height="480" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q19Fa9VDWgg"></iframe></div><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="vrs-equipment---yume-start-nothing-to-it-but-to-do-it"></a>[VRS Equipment - Yume: Start]: Nothing to It but to Do It!<a class="hash-link" href="#vrs-equipment---yume-start-nothing-to-it-but-to-do-it" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Maki:</strong> [mumble mumble mumble]...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Geez, Maki-onee-san, how long&#x27;re you going to keep reading the instructions for?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Just give me a bit more time, Yume. I want to thoroughly drill myself on all the game commands, just in case a bug occurs in the game world.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Shidou-san, I understand why you might feel unsure of using cutting edge technology, but I can assure you, this VR game Kitora-san and I helped to develop is perfectly safe. You have nothing to worry about.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> That&#x27;s right-, they say it&#x27;s popular with other toji onee-sans too, so it&#x27;s fine.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Still, since they say it&#x27;s an action shooting game, there&#x27;s no way to avoid battling enemies, is there? If worse comes to worst, and I end up losing with a weapon I&#x27;m not used to...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Come on-, you take everything way too seriously, Maki-onee-san-.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I have to agree. There is a battle stage in this VR game, but exploring the city is the main objective, so that won&#x27;t be an issue.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> See, this onee-san&#x27;s saying the same thing. Let&#x27;s get started already-.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Just hang on! Only another 20 pages and I&#x27;ll have finished the manual...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> With these things, it&#x27;s easy to just learn while playing-. Isn&#x27;t it, Onee-san?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I believe that everyone learns in different ways. Tsubakuro-san, if you&#x27;re ever in trouble, please ask Shidou-san for the commands.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Okaaay! Maki-onee-san, as soon as you&#x27;re ready, we&#x27;re going in!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Wow-! Look, look! The city&#x27;s all sparkly and pretty-. Ah, there&#x27;s something up on the roof of that building! Let&#x27;s go check it out!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Hey, Yume! Wait for me! You can&#x27;t run off on your own!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ahaha! This is funnn! I know! Let&#x27;s climb up to the top of that really high building! Hurry up, Maki-onee-san-!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Hold on, I&#x27;ll be right there! ...You know, while we&#x27;re here, this world is incredible. We can jump ten times higher than usual. We got to the top of a high rise building in no time.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ahh! There&#x27;s a helicopter parked on the roof of the next building over! Think I can jump to there?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Oi, hold it, Yume! Even here, a jump that far is going to be...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Err... What was the long distance jump command...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I don&#x27;t believe it-! Maki-onee-san, you even brought the instruction manual in here?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> There&#x27;s times when we&#x27;ll need to have it handy. Just hold on, Yume, I&#x27;m checking over the commands now...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Don&#x27;t worry, it&#x27;s easy peasy!  Here I gooo-! Juuump!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Ahh-- Yume!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> See, look! I jumped to this roof just fine-! You come too, Maki-onee-san-.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Whoa! What&#x27;s with the strength of this wind!? It&#x27;ll be tough reaching there through this.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I&#x27;ll go after it dies down. Oiii, Yume, just to be sure, find somewhere safe to get out of the wind.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I&#x27;ll be fine-. See, if I go all the way into the corner of the roof, I can get a really pretty view of the city at night down bel...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Wah----!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Yume!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> No way! I&#x27;m falling!?<br>

<strong>Yume:</strong> Okay, thanks... Wait, what! Maki-onee-san, you&#x27;re flying!? How? How-?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> In this game world, there&#x27;s a command to fly through the air.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ehhh!? Nobody told me that-!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> It was written in the instruction manual. You should have read it.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Boo-. Instead of reading that big book, it seemed like it&#x27;d be faster learning by trying it yourself-.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Sure, even if you memorize the manual, if you can&#x27;t handle the controls when the time comes, there wasn&#x27;t much point.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Still, it&#x27;s because you took reading it so seriously that you saved me. Thanks.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Here, Yume. We&#x27;ve landed safely.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ahh~, thank goodness!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Hey hey, teach me how to fly in the sky too!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Of course; it&#x27;d be dangerous if this happened again, after all. Watch me closely. You do this...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Okay, okay, like this?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Whoa-, that&#x27;s crazy! I&#x27;m flying too!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> You&#x27;re a natural, Yume. Just after seeing that complicated command one time, you already memorized it.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Hey hey, since I can fly now and all, well, I&#x27;m going to fly up to the top of the highest building!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> It does seem pretty high up there. Though, while we&#x27;re in this world, we might as well enjoy it.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Wow-, it&#x27;s super high up here on the roof! You can see all the night lights in the city-.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Oi, Yume! If you walk on the edge of the building, you&#x27;re going to fall like before!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I&#x27;m fine, I&#x27;m fine! Cause I can fly now! See, look!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Wawawa, I&#x27;m falling-!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Yume! Did you lose your footing again!?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Just kidding! I&#x27;m fine; I remember how to fly, okay.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Hey, Yume! Don&#x27;t tease me like that...<br>

<strong>Maki:</strong> ...Sigh.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...Why not relax some?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> It won&#x27;t help anything to walk around in circles like you&#x27;ve been doing.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Knowing you, you must be worried about Yume, aren&#x27;t you?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> When I think about if Yume&#x27;s doing her workplace experience trip right... I just can&#x27;t settle down.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> The ryokan Yume left for has been hosting students of the Five Traditions for their workplace experience for years.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> We only asked if they would kindly take in Yume, despite not being part of the Five Traditions, and Yomi-san even went along with her.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Nothing of concern is going to happen.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Well, you&#x27;re right... Yeah. I&#x27;ll just focus on my own work.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Tsubakuro-san, the last aradama is headed your way. Please take care of it.<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> ...GGGGG!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Leave it to me-! HAAAAAAAAH!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Annnd done!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> We were just about to get changed and help do hostess work, so don&#x27;t get in our way anymore-.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Good job. I&#x27;ll contact the noro recovery team, so it&#x27;s alright for you to return to the ryokan first, Tsubakuro-san.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Nnn-. I&#x27;ll wait here too. I&#x27;d rather be with you, Onee-san.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Alright then.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> You know, I was slightly surprised to see how proactive you were about your workplace experience.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> You were? I&#x27;ve never really done this kind of thing before, so it feels sort of fresh!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> You don&#x27;t often get a chance to work as a hostess, do you. This is my first time too, so it does feel fresh.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> See~!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> There are no longer any signs of aradama in the area of the ryokan. Please rest assured.<br>
<strong>Ryokan Proprietress:</strong> Thank you very much. It&#x27;s such a help, having you two here.<br>
<strong>Ryokan Proprietress:</strong> Because of you, our guests could go about within the ryokan without starting a panic.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> No matter how many times aradama like that come along, I&#x27;ll beat them right away, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it-.<br>
<strong>Ryokan Proprietress:</strong> Fufu. Though, we would be worried, if aradama appeared that many times in the short time you&#x27;re here.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ah! I guess you&#x27;re right.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Oh yeah. After we put on our hostess clothes, we were going to help out, but, what should we do?<br>
<strong>Ryokan Proprietress:</strong> The work I&#x27;ll have you do is nothing more than simple cleaning of the rooms, and a check over their furnishings.<br>
<strong>Ryokan Proprietress:</strong> We have people hired to take care of the full cleaning, but this is one last check before the guests come through. Whoever is in charge will show you how it&#x27;s done, so please work along with them.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Okaaay~.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="hostess---yume-end-for-the-special-menu"></a>[Hostess - Yume: End]: For the Special Menu!<a class="hash-link" href="#hostess---yume-end-for-the-special-menu" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Yume:</strong> I thought meeting guests and showing them their rooms felt like what a real hostess would do, but I didn&#x27;t think, after we did it a couple times, they&#x27;d ask us to go pick vegetables next.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> They seem to have a special menu of vegetables grown here on the mountain they own that&#x27;s served to guests who request it.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> You think this is enough we&#x27;ve got-?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> It might be. It wouldn&#x27;t be good if we gathered too many at once, so why don&#x27;t we check with the ryokan for now.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Then, I&#x27;ll go ask!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> --Though, now that I&#x27;m looking closer... Onee-san. Were you picking only mushrooms? ...Why? Do you like them?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> There&#x27;s no special reason. I just happened to. Though, these mushrooms have grown well.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> You could make a good soup stock from these shiitake, and their thickness would make them good for use in cooking.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I don&#x27;t like them all that much, but, if the guests like it, it&#x27;s fine.<br>

<strong>Yume:</strong> Maki-onee-san, Suzuka-onee-san!? Why&#x27;re you here!?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> A certain someone was worried to death over you, so we came to see you in the end.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Suzuka... You promised you wouldn&#x27;t say anything.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Oh, did I?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> You&#x27;re treating me like a kid again-. You didn&#x27;t have to worry about me or anything. See, look. I&#x27;m doing my job juuust fine.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Yeah, I can tell. Those all look tasty.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I&#x27;ll be looking forward to enjoying what you&#x27;ve picked for dinner.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> You&#x27;re having these for dinner!?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> We are. We made a reservation just now.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I asked for all four of us, you and Yomi-san included, to sit for dinner together. So stick to your work until then.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Okay! Then, I&#x27;m going to get going!<br>
The next day--</p><p><strong>Yume:</strong> I wasn&#x27;t used to doing any of that stuff, but that was pretty fun yesterday.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> It seems like it&#x27;d be tough working as a hostess every day. There&#x27;s a lot of rooms you have to clean and all.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> That was a fairly established ryokan.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Since we were all there, it would&#x27;ve been nice if all four of us could have slept over there together too.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> But, we were only there for that workplace experience thing, so I get that it would&#x27;ve been hard setting up-.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> On top of that, we have work we can&#x27;t afford to leave undone.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yesterday was truly a spur of the moment arrangement, so we couldn&#x27;t make preparations. Though, it would be nice if the four of us could do something like that again someday.<br>

<strong>Yume:</strong> You always seem like you&#x27;re busy, Maki-onee-san. What&#x27;s going on today?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> We got a report about an aradama, but it seems like a pretty large scale one. There&#x27;s nobody available who can handle it.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> A large scale aradama!!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Then, isn&#x27;t it okay if I go?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> You&#x27;re here on standby, Yume.<br>

<strong>Maki:</strong> A match... As the first seat, that&#x27;s something I can&#x27;t afford to lose.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Well I&#x27;m not gonna lose either.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Cause I&#x27;ll... I&#x27;m going to show tons of people just how strong I am.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> ...Maki-onee-san hits so hard-. My hands are all tingly.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> What&#x27;s the matter, Yume! If you&#x27;re not going to come attack me, I&#x27;ll end things like this!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I think you&#x27;re getting ahead of yourself!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Too soft!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> What part!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Tch!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> You sure are strong, Maki-onee-san! But, I&#x27;m even stronger!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> That&#x27;s something... you only get to say after you win!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Yeah... I&#x27;ll win! I&#x27;m... stronger than you, Maki-onee-san!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Hooray-! I beat Maki-onee-san!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Damnit... Am I supposed to feel frustrated that I lost, or proud my kouhai&#x27;s grown so promising... These are some mixed up feelings.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> So now you know I&#x27;m strong, right? And, starting tomorrow, you&#x27;ll put me on lots of sorties?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Sorties? Wait, that doesn&#x27;t...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> ...No good yet, huh. So I&#x27;ve gotta beat Yukari-sama after all...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> H-Hey, Yume? That&#x27;s not what I meant...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I&#x27;m gonna go over there real quick, Maki-onee-san.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Yukari-sama~.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Yume? What do you need?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Have a fight with me.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> I don&#x27;t have time to entertain you now. Though... If we can do it here, I&#x27;ll keep you company.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Come whenever you&#x27;re ready.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Whenever I&#x27;m ready... When should I...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Go!<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> You dodged that!?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> ...Ahah! This time, I&#x27;ll do something even more ama-- zing!<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> To make me draw my okatana...... That is impressive.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> If we didn&#x27;t get this far, we&#x27;d both be bored, right, Yukari-sama?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> So then, I&#x27;ll do even more-!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> That&#x27;s what I want, Yukari-sama-!<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> ...It&#x27;s about time now. Sorry, Yume.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Uwah!?<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> That&#x27;s all for today.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> J-Just one more time! If I don&#x27;t beat you, they won&#x27;t let me go on any sorties!<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Where did you get that idea? The reason you go on so few sorties is because Shidou and Konohana are concerned about your body.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Huh...? ...But, they never told me about that.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> And anyway, Maki-onee-san and Suzuka-onee-san worry way too much!<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> You shouldn&#x27;t say that.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> But still...<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> ...Yume. You put up a fine attack. I&#x27;ll play with you again, so stay diligent.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Okay!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> (Ahh, that was so fun! I&#x27;ll get even stronger next time, and then I&#x27;ll even beat Yukari-sama!)<br>

<strong>Yukari:</strong> You&#x27;re here. I have a request for you from the Sword Administration Bureau.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> A request?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Is it aradama!? Yukari-sama, did a really tough aradama show up!?<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> ...That&#x27;s not it. This request comes from the public relations department.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Really-? What a letdown-.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> What sort of request is it?<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> You&#x27;ve been requested to participate in an indoor pool&#x27;s event.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> But there&#x27;s no point in us going, is there?<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Don&#x27;t say that, Yume.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Listen to Yukari-sama, Yume. This too is fine work for the elite guard.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Then you onee-sans can go do it on your own.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Yume! Don&#x27;t act so spoiled.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Then, Yume. After you finish this request, I&#x27;ll be your opponent. It&#x27;s been a while.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> You mean it!? Then, I guess I have to go.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> But, you have to promise, Yukari-sama! You can&#x27;t go saying you take it back after this!<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Good. I promise.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Is that alright?<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> It&#x27;s not too much to ask. And...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Yesss-! I finally get to fight against Yukari-sama-!<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> If she&#x27;s that happy about it.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ...I see.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Yukari-sama, can you share with me the details of the event? I&#x27;ll have to get notes ready in advance for the speech.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Wait, Maki-san. I&#x27;ll take care of that.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Thanks, Suzuka. I&#x27;m leaving it to you.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Of course; you can rely on me.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Though, about your assignment this time... You won&#x27;t be part of a ceremony.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> You will be giving a dance performance as part of the pool&#x27;s Arabian event.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Eh...!?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Instead of listening to some boring speeches at a ceremony, we&#x27;re dancing?  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="1001-nights---yume-end-a-promise-for-next-time"></a>[1,001 Nights - Yume: End]: A Promise for Next Time<a class="hash-link" href="#1001-nights---yume-end-a-promise-for-next-time" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>--The day of the event.</p><p><strong>Maki:</strong> We have to wear these!?<br>

<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yes... It&#x27;s embarrassing for me as well.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Why don&#x27;t you want to wear it that bad though?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> It doesn&#x27;t really feel like something you&#x27;d say, Maki-onee-san. You&#x27;d be more like, &quot;All clothes are the same-!&quot;<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ...I don&#x27;t think all clothes are the same.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> And I&#x27;m just... a little self-conscious about my stomach.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> You mean cause it&#x27;ll be cold?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> That&#x27;s not it.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ...Isn&#x27;t my stomach way too toned compared to everybody?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> My, were you really worried about that?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> You&#x27;re a real workout monster, Maki-onee-san-.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> We&#x27;re out of time, everyone. Please hurry and change.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Okaaay.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> So she says. Time to find your resolve, Maki-san...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> But... Gh, I guess this is a mission too!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Hmhmhmm~! And, turn here!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ahaha! I didn&#x27;t think dancing would be this fun!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> You were the one who didn&#x27;t want to do this the most at first, Yume, and now you&#x27;re having the most fun with it.<br>

<strong>Maki:</strong> I was just hearing from her about the incident going on. What did you need, Yume?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Aradama showed up, so I came to get her. Let&#x27;s go together, Fate-chan.<br>
<strong>Fate:</strong> Aradama...? But...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> It&#x27;s fine with me. Though, when you get back, I might have to talk with you again...<br>
<strong>Fate:</strong> ...Thank you, Maki-san.<br>
<strong>Fate:</strong> If helping out could reduce the damage they cause by even a little, I&#x27;ll go along with you.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Neat! I&#x27;ll be sure to show you a whole bunch of how strong I am!<br>
<strong>Fate:</strong> Eh? But I know that you&#x27;re strong, Yume-san.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I can&#x27;t wait! Let&#x27;s get there fast, Fate-chan!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> They&#x27;ve arrived at last... Oh? Why is Harlaown-san here?<br>
<strong>Fate:</strong> I accepted Yume-san&#x27;s invitation to help.<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong> Ah, it&#x27;s Fate-chan.<br>
<strong>Fate:</strong> Wait, Nanoha?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I asked Takamachi-san to assist me. We were working together just before this.<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong> Yomi-san was actually with us too, but she had to go someplace else.<br>
<strong>Fate:</strong> Is that how it happened. Let&#x27;s do what we can, Nanoha.<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong> Sure, Fate-chan!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> So anyway, why&#x27;re you just standing around doing nothing here?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> We were waiting for you, Tsubakuro-san.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Oh, you were? Then, you can go back and leave the rest to me, Onee-san.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I probably could-.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> We won&#x27;t go back, but I&#x27;ll count on you to do your best.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Sure!<br>
<strong>Fate:</strong> Umm... Is this going to be okay, Tsugumi-san?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Is what okay?<br>
<strong>Fate:</strong> The aradama... Isn&#x27;t it going to be hard when they show up? I don&#x27;t get that feeling from Yume-san...<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Tsubakuro-san is plenty strong though-.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Since she doesn&#x27;t struggle fighting aradama, there&#x27;s not much sense of danger, so perhaps a part of her merely thinks of it as an extended game.<br>
<strong>Fate:</strong> Then, why is it that Yume-san became a toji?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Only Tsubakuro-san knows the answer to that.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong>  Though... Everything will be fine.<br>
<strong>Fate:</strong> Eh?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Tsubakuro-san is a toji too. Please have faith in her.<br>

<strong>Fate:</strong> You don&#x27;t need to go that far, Yume-san.<br>
<strong>Fate:</strong> I think it&#x27;s incredible how you can defeat aradama the moment we find them.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> That&#x27;s not really that incredible or anything.<br>
<strong>Fate:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Fate:</strong> Why did you become a toji, Yume-san?<br>

<strong>Fate:</strong> What makes you strong?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Yeah. That&#x27;s why, I thought I&#x27;d get to show you too, Fate-chan, but...<br>

<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Okay, that&#x27;s enough-.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ehhh!? What&#x27;re you and Nanoha-chan doing here, Onee-san?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> We heard something troubling going on, so we hurried over.<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong> Fate-chan, if you&#x27;re going to fight with Yume-san, I think you should do it after the mission&#x27;s over...<br>
<strong>Fate:</strong> Y-You&#x27;ve got it all wrong, Nanoha! I was making sure to do the mission!?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Geez, and it was just getting fun too. Let&#x27;s pick up from here when we get back, Fate-chan.<br>

<strong>Yomi:</strong> Not exactly all of them, but everyone from the Five Traditions was invited, so the majority should be toji.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> That&#x27;s a lot though! So, who do you think&#x27;s the strongest of them all?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I can&#x27;t really tell, so I think I&#x27;ll just challenge whoever I feel like!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yume, we&#x27;re all here today to appreciate the flowers, not to fight amongst each other.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> That&#x27;s right. And besides, our job here is to act as guards.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> We&#x27;re keeping this up until late tonight, so you&#x27;re going to wear yourself out if you&#x27;re getting too excited first thing.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> We&#x27;re doing this until night? Didn&#x27;t they say we were just guarding during the day?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Oh yeah; you&#x27;re only in charge of the day part, aren&#x27;t you.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> The day part? So that means the party&#x27;s still going on at night too?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Akane-sama proposed that we split the party into two parts, for the toji who couldn&#x27;t arrive during the day due to their missions.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> She did? So wait, then, I can just be a normal guest for the night part, right?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Sure; but don&#x27;t get too carried away with it.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Nice-!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ah-- There&#x27;s some onee-sans over there! Heyyy!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Oh; Yume-chan! Come and look! They decorated this cake with flowers all over; isn&#x27;t it cute?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Wow; it really is! --Wait, forget that, come out to the courtyard with me, Onee-san!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Huh? The courtyard? Did you want to look at the flowers together?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Not that-! There&#x27;s a whole bunch of toji coming here today, so we&#x27;re going to have a big match to see who&#x27;s the strongest!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> That sounds cool! You&#x27;ll come too, right, Hiyori-chan?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Hmm... If you say so, then I guess I have to.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> That&#x27;ll be fun! Let me in too-!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Yayyy, more and more people are coming! I can fight anybody I want! So, who should I beat first-?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Hey, Yume! The moment I take my eyes off you, you&#x27;re already starting something.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Our team&#x27;s duty is to act as security for the venue today.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> You&#x27;re meant to mingle naturally amongst the partygoers while keeping an eye on things...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Boo... But for me though, fighting with everybody&#x27;s the most natural thing to do.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> You might be right, but you are on duty, at least during the day. Please bear with it.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Fiiine...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ahh, I&#x27;m so bored. They said just to enjoy the party normally, so I ate the food, and talked, and...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Yawwwn. Now I&#x27;m feeling tired cause I&#x27;m full.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Zzzzzzzzzzzz......<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Yawwwn... Huh? It&#x27;s dark out...?<br>

<strong>Yume:</strong> Did all the toji onee-sans really leave already?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Yeah. They all said they&#x27;d be busy with missions and training again first thing tomorrow morning.<br>

<strong>Yomi:</strong> To appreciate the flowers...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Hey, it&#x27;s alright; if you want to spar with somebody, I&#x27;ll do it with you tomorrow.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> You&#x27;re no good, Maki-onee-san! I wanted to fight with a whole lot more people.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Sigh... I suppose we should have woken you up regardless.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> There&#x27;s not much we can do now though. Right, Yomi?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Hm...? Where&#x27;d Yomi go? Did she go back to her room already?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> We should return as well. I&#x27;ll have my father send more flowers next year, so we can look forward to having the party again.<br>

<strong>Yume:</strong> Yomi-onee-san? Didn&#x27;t you go back to your room?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I thought about it, but I saw that the bar was still open.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> If you&#x27;d like, will you have a drink with me?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Whoa! This cocktail&#x27;s so pretty! But, is it really okay for somebody young to drink this?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I had them make special non-alcoholic ones.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Neat! Then I&#x27;ll have some!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> What&#x27;s with this; it&#x27;s super yummy! They didn&#x27;t have this at the party, did they?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> They didn&#x27;t. Since the orders had slowed down, it seems that they made extra flavorful ones for us.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> So this special cocktail&#x27;s just for you and me? Thanks, Yomi-onee-san!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I&#x27;m glad to see you&#x27;re feeling better now.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Next year, I want to invite even more toji, and then we can have a really exciting party!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> And then, everybody can have this cocktail there too! Doesn&#x27;t that sound good?<br>

<strong>Yume:</strong> Chidori-onee-san&#x27;ll remember... that I&#x27;m strong. That I was strong.<br>
<strong>???:</strong> Are you satisfied with that?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Who&#x27;s there?<br>
<strong>Tagitsu:</strong> You may call me Tagitsuhime.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Tagitsuhime? Wasn&#x27;t that the great aradama Yukari-sama beat? Wait... then why&#x27;re you here?<br>
<strong>Tagitsu:</strong> No need to mind something so trifling. That&#x27;s not what matters now, Tsubakuro Yume. Do you not want to live
longer?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> ...I don&#x27;t really care. I don&#x27;t think I need to live that much.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Because... Chidori-onee-san&#x27;s gonna remember me.<br>
<strong>Tagitsu:</strong> And after Etou Kanami has died?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> ...Huh?<br>
<strong>Tagitsu:</strong> If Etou Kanami were to die, no one will remain to remember your strength.<br>
<strong>Tagitsu:</strong> Would you be satisfied?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> That&#x27;d...<br>
<strong>Tagitsu:</strong> Accept me into yourself, Tsubakuro Yume.<br>
<strong>Tagitsu:</strong> I could truly grant your wishes. Merge aradama and humanity, evolving this immature species to a higher
existence.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Evolve...?<br>
<strong>Tagitsu:</strong> A plan to erode it all.<br>
<strong>Tagitsu:</strong> Humanity will live on for eternity. None who remember you will ever die.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> ...I can keep having fun forever...<br>
<strong>Tagitsu:</strong> That&#x27;s right. What will you choose, Tsubakuro Yume.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Yume!? You&#x27;re really alive...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Maki-san.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> R-Right... Yume-sama, congratulations on your recovery.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Wait, why &quot;Yume-sama&quot;?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> That was Yukari-sama&#x27;s final request, as she was undergoing medical treatment. To treat and serve Yume-sama
as if you were her.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Yukari-sama, she...<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes. Tsubakuro-sama, if you would come this way.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Yomi-onee-san...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> (I can&#x27;t talk to them like we used to... And Yukari-sama&#x27;s gone too...)<br>
<strong>Tagitsu:</strong> (Carry through the all erosion plan. Do that, and everything will be just to your wishes.)<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> (...Yeah. If I do the all erosion plan, everything&#x27;ll go back to normal. I just have to do the all erosion
plan...)  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="another---yume-end-once-more-with-those-dear"></a>[Another - Yume: End]: Once More with Those Dear<a class="hash-link" href="#another---yume-end-once-more-with-those-dear" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Yomi:</strong> Tsubakuro-sama. Akane-sama has escaped her imprisonment, with Mokusa&#x27;s assistance.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Just send Maki-onee-san and Suzuka-onee-san. Those two should be able to handle it. Right, Yomi-onee-san?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> They will.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> When I heard Mokusa broke Akane-sama out, I never thought it&#x27;d be you two! Etou, Juujou!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> If you give up Akane-sama in peace, we can settle this without having to do anything unsavory.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> We refuse. Do you really think we&#x27;d going along with that... when we know we&#x27;d just get taken out like
Origami Yukari?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ...Taken out? What are you talking about?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> We&#x27;d never... That&#x27;s ridiculous...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> It&#x27;s the truth. Origami Yukari got abandoned by Tagitsuhime and was about to be killed. That&#x27;s when...
Kanami and I saved her.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Tagitsuhime... and Yukari-sama...?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Tagitsuhime&#x27;s possessing Tsubakuro-san right now. You can&#x27;t keep doing what she says!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Yume&#x27;s... possessed by Tagitsuhime... No wonder... I&#x27;ve been feeling like Yume was acting like Yukari-sama
used to.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> That is true... If you&#x27;re saying it&#x27;s because of Tagitsuhime, I could accept that...<br>
<strong>Akane:</strong> Maki-san, Suzuka-san. Please hear us out. Work together with us.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ...That I can&#x27;t do.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> But why not!?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Regardless of everything... Yume is still dear to us...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Even if she were being manipulated by Tagitsuhime... We couldn&#x27;t turn our okatana on her.<br>
<strong>Akane:</strong> ...Could you at least tell this to Tsubakuro-san? That Kanami-san and Juujou-san wish to become myouga toji.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> That&#x27;s an excuse to meet with Yume...?<br>
<strong>Akane:</strong> That&#x27;s right. It would be Yume-san&#x27;s decision to make.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> If that&#x27;s all... But...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Maki-san... I&#x27;ll support whatever you decide on.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ...Thanks, Suzuka.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> We&#x27;re just letting her know. After that... We&#x27;ll follow what Yume decides.<br>
<strong>Akane:</strong> That&#x27;s more than enough.<br>
<strong>Akane:</strong> ...We&#x27;re depending on you for the rest, Kanami-san, Hiyori-san.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Sure, you can leave it to us.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Right. Kanami and I will absolutely destroy Tagitsuhime.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Chidori-onee-san said she wants to be a myouga toji!? Yeah, I&#x27;ll see her right away!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Now she can keep on remembering me! We&#x27;ll keep having fun forever and ever!<br>
<strong>Tagitsu:</strong> (...It&#x27;s possible this is a trap.)<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Yeah, I know that. But, does it matter? If it is, I&#x27;ll just beat her and make her a myouga toji anyway.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> We can keep it going... The fun&#x27;ll keep going forever and ever and ever!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> There&#x27;s nothing fun about that! Back then... even that was more fun!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> !?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Toji who go through myouga, their minds get put under your control, right?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Back then, when you told me to remember you, was that how you meant it!?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Those two in the elite guard, they were worried about you. But they said, no matter what you did, they&#x27;d
never betray you... That they could never turn their okatana on you.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Even still... are you seriously okay with that! You&#x27;re going to brainwash the elite guard... them too!?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I remember it all, Tsubakuro-san! How strong you are!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Not the strength Tagitsuhime gave you! The real Tsubakuro-san... she&#x27;s so much stronger than this!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> But... If I don&#x27;t, the people who remember me, they&#x27;ll be gone eventually.<br>
<strong>Tagitsu:</strong> (Yes, that&#x27;s exactly right.)<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Onee-sans, you&#x27;re getting this wrong. The plan to erode it all... I&#x27;m the one who wants to do it.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> So long as... I get to stay together with everybody forever, I don&#x27;t care. So long as this can go on forever,
I don&#x27;t care!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> But...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...We&#x27;re switching up, Kanami. She&#x27;s... going to be tough.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ahahahahaha! Just wait, onee-sans! I&#x27;ll beat you so fast and make you myouga!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> And then... You&#x27;ll never, ever forget me!!</p></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="theme-doc-footer-edit-meta-row row"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations/edit/docs/episodes/Tsubakuro_Yume_Episodes.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="theme-edit-this-page"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_2_ui" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_13-_"></div></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/tnm-translations/docs/episodes/Satsuki_Yomi_Episodes/"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Â« Satsuki Yomi Episodes</div></a></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/tnm-translations/docs/episodes/Hiiragi_Kagari_Episodes/"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Next</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Hiiragi Kagari Episodes Â»</div></a></div></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_35-E thin-scrollbar"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#1-meeting-maki" class="table-of-contents__link">1: Meeting Maki</a></li><li><a href="#2-shopping-with-yume" class="table-of-contents__link">2: Shopping with Yume</a></li><li><a href="#3-yumes-unreasonable-request" class="table-of-contents__link">3: Yume&#39;s Unreasonable Request</a></li><li><a href="#4-yumes-adult-appeal" class="table-of-contents__link">4: Yume&#39;s Adult Appeal</a></li><li><a href="#5-yume-vs-kanami" class="table-of-contents__link">5: Yume vs Kanami</a></li><li><a href="#furisode-part-1-yumes-first-shrine-visit-of-the-year" class="table-of-contents__link">Furisode Part 1: Yume&#39;s First Shrine Visit of the Year</a></li><li><a href="#furisode-part-2-thank-you" class="table-of-contents__link">Furisode Part 2: Thank You</a></li><li><a href="#vrs-equipment---yume-start-nothing-to-it-but-to-do-it" class="table-of-contents__link">VRS Equipment - Yume: Start: Nothing to It but to Do It!</a></li><li><a href="#vrs-equipment---yume-end-seriousness-pays-off" class="table-of-contents__link">VRS Equipment - Yume: End: Seriousness Pays Off</a></li><li><a href="#hostess---yume-start-yumes-work-experience" class="table-of-contents__link">Hostess - Yume: Start: Yume&#39;s Work Experience!</a></li><li><a href="#hostess---yume-end-for-the-special-menu" class="table-of-contents__link">Hostess - Yume: End: For the Special Menu!</a></li><li><a href="#misogi---yume-start-why-wont-you-let-me" class="table-of-contents__link">Misogi - Yume: Start: Why Won&#39;t You Let Me!</a></li><li><a href="#misogi---yume-end-ill-get-even-stronger" class="table-of-contents__link">Misogi - Yume: End: I&#39;ll Get Even Stronger!</a></li><li><a href="#1001-nights---yume-start-a-request" class="table-of-contents__link">1,001 Nights - Yume: Start: A Request</a></li><li><a href="#1001-nights---yume-end-a-promise-for-next-time" class="table-of-contents__link">1,001 Nights - Yume: End: A Promise for Next Time</a></li><li><a href="#mahou-shoujo---yume-start-lets-go-together" class="table-of-contents__link">Mahou Shoujo - Yume: Start: Let&#39;s Go Together!</a></li><li><a href="#mahou-shoujo---yume-end-its-not-like-that" class="table-of-contents__link">Mahou Shoujo - Yume: End: It&#39;s Not Like That!?</a></li><li><a href="#dress-21---yume-start-you-excited-its-the-spring-flower-party" class="table-of-contents__link">Dress '21 - Yume: Start: You Excited?
