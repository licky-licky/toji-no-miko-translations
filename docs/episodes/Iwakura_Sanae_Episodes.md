## 1: A Gourmet Tour of My Native Gunma
**Sanae:** With the noro recovery taken care of, our mission here is complete.  
**Kaoru:** Y'know, with you coming along, this went pretty smoothly. I wasn't sure how things would go when we were getting shipped off to Gunma.  
**Nene:** Ne-!  
**Kaoru:** I wanted to grab something good to eat before heading back to the hotel, but really, what are the odds of finding something like that here in the uncharted wastes of Gunma? I'm morbidly curious.  
**Nene:** Nenee...?  
**Sanae:** Hey, hang on... Mashiko-san, Nene-chan, Gunma has its local delicacies too, you know!  
**Kaoru:** Does it? Then, how about you prove it. Show me those delicacies.  
**Sanae:** Leave everything to me. Gunma is where I'm from, after all.  
**Kaoru:** Gunma... They're actually building cities here?  
**Sanae:** Come on, even in the countryside we have towns that are this built up.  
**Kaoru:** Well, making fun of Gunma aside. So? What do you suggest for lunch?  
**Sanae:** How about mizusawa udon, or sauce katsudon? Which would the two of you prefer?  
**Kaoru:** Udon, or katsudon... It's tough.  
**Sanae:** The mizusawa udon gets my highest recommendation. When you slurp down those springy, slippery noodles, all coated in a soy or sesame sauce, it's just the best...!  
**Sanae:** You'll never get tired of it, since the sauce always changes a little depending on where you go.  
**Kaoru:** At the very least, I get that you love mizusawa udon. It's probably been a while since you came back here, so why not. Let's go with udon for lunch.  
**Kaoru:** That was great-. They say local delicacies are never delicious, but there's plenty of exceptions, huh.  
**Nene:** Ne~!  
**Sanae:** And Nene-chan, even though you're an aradama, you still eat food, don't you. I was a little shocked after I first saw it.  
**Kaoru:** He helps himself to whatever I'm eating, so I didn't get my fill...  
**Sanae:** Then, what do you think about fried meat buns or gelato? For dessert.  
**Kaoru:** Ooh, sounds nice. I'm interested in trying those fried meat buns.  
**Sanae:** Then it's settled~.  
**Kaoru:** Freshly fried is the best. I could get addicted to that sweet sauce too. After checking this place out, Gunma's not so bad. Looks like they have hot springs here too.  
**Sanae:** I'm glad to hear you feel that way.  
**Sanae:** Nene~.  
**Sanae:** Fufu, are you liking it here too, Nene-chan?  
**Sanae:** If only every aradama could be more like Nene-chan.  
**Kaoru:** Nene was supposed to be pretty wild in the past too. But it'd be great if other aradama could be this laid back. Would save us the trouble of having to hunt them down on missions.  
**Nene:** Nenenene~!  
**Sanae:** Kya... Hey, Nene-chan, you're getting too playful. Bad Nene-chan! Okay?  
**Nene:** Ne-...  
**Kaoru:** He's been spoiled too much lately, which gets him a little overeager.  
**Nene:** Nenene...  
**Sanae:** (Watching Mashiko-san and Nene-chan together is sort of like seeing an older sister with her mischievous little brother...)  
**Sanae:** (Getting along with aradama... It might be difficult, but, looking at these two, it might be an ideal partnership.)  
**Kaoru:** Sanae, if he's ever bugging you, feel free to let him have it.  
**Sanae:** Fufu, alright then. Nene-chan, let's get along together, okay?  

## 2: What is the Strength I Should Pursue?
**Sanae:** Isn't it amazing that Shidou-senpai went all the way to winning the championship match of the tournament? What kind of training did she do to for that, I wonder.  
**Classmate:** You're totally one of Shidou-senpai's fangirls now, huh Sanae? Not just with the tournament, but since you went to see her fighting in the qualifiers.  
**Sanae:** I don't think I'm her fangirl...? I just sort of look up to her, because she's so cool.  
**Classmate:** Your homework for tomorrow is to think about if there's any difference there. Anyway, I should get going.  
**Sanae:** Okay. I'll talk to you later.  
**Sanae:** Now, what should I do? ...I guess I'll do some training after all, then head home.  
**Sanae:** (What should I be doing to get stronger...?ã€€I keep practicing, but I don't feel any results.)  
**Sanae:** Eh!? Over there, that's... Sh-Shidou-senpai!?  
**Maki:** Er, are you one of this year's new students?  
**Sanae:** ...I-I am! First year in the middle school division, my name is Iwakura Sanae!  
**Sanae:** Uhh... Um, Shidou-senpai... Congratulations, on winning the overall tournament!  
**Maki:** Thanks. The tournament must have a bigger reach than I thought, if I'm getting congratulated by a kouhai whose name I didn't even know a minute ago.  
**Sanae:** I watched you fighting in the qualifiers here at Heijou! You looked incredible. You were so strong...  
**Maki:** Hearing that face to face... It's a bit embarrassing.  
**Sanae:** Um, there's something I wanted to ask you about. Would that be alright?  
**Maki:** Sure, that's fine by me. So long as I can help you with it.  
**Sanae:** What do I have to do, to be strong like you are?  
**Sanae:** I want to get even stronger. But... Even if I keep training, I just don't know. What does it mean, to be strong?  
**Maki:** That's a tough question... Give me some time to think about it.  
**Maki:** I thought it over, but honestly, I'm still not sure what it means to be strong either.  
**Sanae:** Shidou-senpai... You don't know either?  
**Maki:** Yeah. I can't give you a simple answer. But, "to keep wondering what it means to be strong", I feel like that itself is connected to what makes you strong.  
**Sanae:** ...To keep on wondering, what it means to be strong.  
**Maki:** To find the kind of strength you're aiming for, I guess. If you can't find that, won't the path to getting stronger be needlessly difficult? ...I hope that can help you.  
**Sanae:** Thank you very much; it helped a lot! I'm going to reflect on finding my own strength.  
**Maki:** Glad to hear it. I'll be going then. Let's both give it our best.  
**Sanae:** Of course!  
**Sanae:** (Today, for my first mission, I just had to do what I could to keep up with the more experienced toji... I was scared... There were times I couldn't do it like I practiced... But, thanks to my senpais, we still finished the mission.)  
**Sanae:** (Someone got hurt, even if it wasn't too bad... Getting hurt is just a part of the job, that's what they told me. Still, it's a sad thing when someone is in pain.)  
**Sanae:** (I want to make things as painless as I can. Which means I have to get rid of as many aradama as I can. Maybe I'm being too idealistic. But, still...)  
**Sanae:** I think I need to reflect more on my own strength, like Shidou-senpai said.  
**Sanae:** If I can find it someday... Will I be a strong toji then?  

## 3: The Form Conviction Takes
**Sanae:** (Juujou-san... She got in an argument with a classmate today... It makes me a little worried for her.)  
**Sanae:** (It's been a few months since she transferred... It doesn't seem like she's made any friends yet. I feel like it's been a long while since I even saw her talking to anyone besides the teachers...)  
**Sanae:** (If I can, I'd like to set her up to get along better with our classmates... But, would I just be bothering her...? Hmm.)  
**Sanae:** Hm? I can hear something, over that way. I wonder what it is?  
**Hiyori:** HAA...!  
**Hiyori:** HNPH...!  
**Sanae:** (There, practicing with a sword, isn't that Juujou-san?)  
**Sanae:** (She really is passionate about it. But, in her hand... I haven't seen that one before, but that's...)  
**Sanae:** ...An okatana?  
**Hiyori:** Wh-Who's there!?  
**Sanae:** Sorry, it's me. I thought I heard something, so I came to take a look.  
**Hiyori:** ...  
**Sanae:** That okatana, is it yours, Juujou-san...?  
**Sanae:** It's rare to see a sharp edge on the backside of a sword.  
**Hiyori:** That's right, the end of it is double-edged. It's an okatana made in an older time.  
**Hiyori:** I got permission to take ownership of Kogarasumaru from President Gojou, but I'd appreciate it if you didn't mention this to anyone.  
**Sanae:** Sure, I won't tell anybody. I promise.  
**Sanae:** (...She was willing to tell me all about her okatana...!)  
**Sanae:** (Maybe Kogarasumaru means a lot to Juujou-san. It might be a little unfair of me to attach a condition here, but...)  
**Sanae:** But in exchange, and you only have to do it a little bit, but could you try getting along more with our classmates?  
**Hiyori:** Sorry; that's not going to happen.  
**Sanae:** ...But why not?  
**Hiyori:** I'm going to be in the next year's tournament. To make that happen, I want to spend all the time I possibly can on training.  
**Hiyori:** That's my current goal, as a toji.  
**Sanae:** As a toji...  
**Hiyori:** That's why, you should forget about me too, Iwakura-san. I don't care if people hate me for acting this way.  
**Sanae:** (...She's not just stoic. For her to have that kind of determination...)  
**Sanae:** I now understand why you're doing this.  
**Sanae:** But, I'm still going to treat you the same as always. I couldn't hate you, Juujou-san.  
**Hiyori:** ...I don't get it. [muttered]  
**Hiyori:** ...Suit yourself. I'm going back to training.  
**Hiyori:** ...HNPH!  
**Sanae:** (She handles her sword without it wavering in the slightest... It's like the embodiment of Juujou-san's unshakable conviction.)  
**Sanae:** (Her stance seems a little overbearing... But that could just be the shape in which her strength shows itself.)  
**Sanae:** (Like I spoke to Shidou-senpai about; strength and conviction... Both things I still don't have.)  
**Sanae:** I can't help but admire her... [whispered]  
**Sanae:** (Juujou-san is so driven, but she's still the same age as us. Someday... I want to see her act more her age too.)  
**Sanae:** (It'd be nice if I could get close enough to her that she'd let her guard down around me...)  
--The next day.

  
**Sanae:** Morning, Juujou-san.  
**Hiyori:** ......  
**Hiyori:** ...Good morning.  
**Sanae:** !  
**Sanae:** Fufu, let's do our best today.  

## 4: Juujou-san and Musumi-san
**Sanae:** Eh, Juujou-san is with Musumi-san? I wonder what they're talking about?  
**Kiyoka/Hiyori:** ......  
**Sanae:** Those two seem like they've been getting along together recently.  
**Sanae:** (It makes me... A little curious.)  
**Kiyoka:** Ah, Iwakura-san! So you came by this way. I was just with Juujou-san until a minute ago.  
**Sanae:** Mmhm. Musumi-san, you've been talking with Juujou-san a lot lately, haven't you?  
**Kiyoka:** I-I have... With our alliance activities...  
**Sanae:** Alliance??  
**Kiyoka:** Ah, I mean... How should I put it... It's like an association, for kindred spirits...!?  
**Sanae:** It sounds kind of fun. Could I join in?  
**Kiyoka:** You want to be in our alliance?  
**Kiyoka:** Hmmm... That's...  
**Kiyoka:** ......!  
**Sanae:** Eh...? What are you looking around my chest for... Musumi-san?  
**Sanae:** (The way she's staring so intently... I-It's embarrassing.)  
**Sanae:** Q-Question! ...This, alliance... What do you normally do?  
**Kiyoka:** ...! Wh-What, do we do...? In the alliance?  
**Sanae:** ...Right. You aren't doing anything strange, are you?  
**Kiyoka:** N-Nothing strange at all!  
**Kiyoka:** Umm... We often get together to come up with, ways to increase our development? In a sense...  
**Sanae:** That does sound like Juujou-san... She's so introspective. Since my underclassman is working hard at it, then as a toji, I have to grow more too.  
**Kiyoka:** ......  
**Kiyoka:** Well... If I had to say one way or the other, it's more about developing our bodies.  
**Sanae:** Eh... That's what you meant!?  
**Sanae:** S-Still... Juujou-san, with her tall figure, she does look very cool.  
**Kiyoka:** I know what you mean... I do think she's cool...  
**Sanae:** What other kinds of things do you do?  
**Kiyoka:** We do stretches to stimulate ourselves, and share information on foods that are good for our bodies!  
**Sanae:** Hmm, I think I'm interested in it after all, this alliance of yours.  
**Kiyoka:** ...N-New members have to go through a strict inspection, so I can't say right now...  
**Sanae:** Th-Then... I guess it can't be helped. By the way, is that book yours, Musumi-san?  
**Kiyoka:** Yes, I had lent it to Juujou-san. I've been hooked on these romance novels lately--  
**Sanae:** Eh!?  
**Sanae:** (...J-Juujou-san, she reads romance novels!?)  
**Sanae:** (Ah, thinking back, she was reading a book in the classroom too.)  
**Sanae:** (Juujou-san... Silently reading a romance novel in the classroom, hmm... Maybe blushing to herself every now and then? It's surprisingly believable...)  
**Kiyoka:** Is something wrong?  
**Sanae:** S-Sorry... I didn't mean to shout like that. What's the title of that book?  
**Kiyoka:** "Heart's Recollection"! If you'd like, do you want to borrow it?  
**Sanae:** Thank you. I'm a little excited to read it now.  
**Sanae:** (Next time I see Juujou-san, I can talk to her about romance novels, and ask her about her stretches!)  

## 5: On That Day
--The day before the tournament.

  
**Sanae:** We're finally here; in Kamakura.  
**Hiyori:** Right. At last.  
**Sanae:** A year ago, I never would have thought I'd be coming here as one of Heijou's representatives.  
**Sanae:** (What Shidou-senpai told me, to think about my strength. What Juujou-san showed me, as she devoted herself towards her goal.)  
**Sanae:** (I think... It's because I met these two, that I've grown enough to be part of tomorrow's tournament.)  
**Hiyori:** ......  
**Sanae:** I'm feeling nervous... What about you, Juujou-san?  
**Hiyori:** ...I guess so. If I said I wasn't nervous, I'd be lying.  
**Sanae:** I know just the thing. Since we came all the way to Kamakura, why don't we find something good to eat among the local delicacies?  
**Sanae:** I think it'll be just what we need to help us relax.  
**Sanae:** (Though, like usual, she'll tell me she doesn't need something like that.)  
**Hiyori:** I'll be fine.  
**Sanae:** (See. It sort of feels like her head is in the clouds right now.)  
**Sanae:** Then, how about, after the tournament is over, we can stop by somewhere before we leave? I'll look for someplace nice.  
**Hiyori:** ...Sure.  
**Sanae:** ...!  
**Sanae:** (Does this mean... After the tournament is finished, I can get closer to Juujou-san?)  
**Sanae:** In that case, let's give it our best shot at the tournament tomorrow!  
**Sanae:** ...I went and lost. Though, just making it this far is enough for me.  
**Sanae:** (And, sure enough, Juujou-san will be advancing to the finals.)  
**Sanae:** (That much isn't surprising. I don't have any idea how much effort she put into preparing for this. But, sometimes, I caught a glimpse of it.)  
**Sanae:** (I don't think the other toji are weak. But, when it comes to Juujou-san-- I know she can do it!)  
**Sanae:** Ah, I'd better get moving now.  
**Hiyori:** ......  
**Sanae:** (What is Juujou-san feeling, standing up there now?)  
**Sanae:** (I wanted to talk to her before the finals started. I thought a lot about it... But, I never did.)  
**Sanae:** (I wasn't sure what I would say either. All I knew was, at this time, she didn't need me to say anything... That's the feeling I got from her.)  
**Sanae:** (So, after this match is over, I want to go talk to her.)  
**Sanae:** (Hopefully, I'll get to say, "Congratulations!" and see her face light up--)  
The referee signals the two who advanced to the finals to bow. The match is about to begin.

  
**Sanae:** (Juujou-san! You can do it--!)  

## [Sanae Joins: Start]: The Curious Transfer Student
**Sanae:** (As the curtain closed on the tournament, with Shidou-senpai winning her second consecutive championship, around the time when spring was ending... That's when she arrived.)  
**Sanae:** (A transfer student, a little outside of the usual season... Despite that, her skill as a toji was outstandingly superior. Everyone could plainly see it.)  
**Sanae:** (That was what made all of us interested in Juujou Hiyori-san.)  
**Classmate A:** Hey, Juujou-san! You were amazing in today's practical training!  
**Classmate B:** I know, right? She could hold her utsushi longer than anybody in class too.  
**Hiyori:** ......  
**Classmate A:** Oh yeah. After this, if you're free, there's a bunch of things I'd like to ask you--  
**Hiyori:** ...Sorry, but I'm in a hurry.  
**Classmate A:** ...Eh? S-Sorry. We'll talk later?  
**Classmate B:** Did we... do something to make Juujou-san mad? What do you think, class rep?  
**Sanae:** Hmm... I'm not sure. Maybe she's just not used to the class yet...?  
**Sanae:** I'll try talking to her next time. I'd like to be her friend too.  
**Sanae:** (But, that turned out to only be our wishful thinking...)  
**Sanae:** Oh, Juujou-san. Why don't we get lunch together after this?  
**Hiyori:** I'm fine... Just leave me alone.  
**Sanae:** (Mmm... Another failed attempt today.)  
**Classmate A:** You're trying your hardest, Sanae.  
**Sanae:** I am, but that's because I'm kind of worried. About Juujou-san.  
**Classmate A:** Still... You don't have to force yourself to talk to her, you know? Juujou-san seems like she prefers it that way too.  
**Sanae:** Maybe you're right, but...  
**Classmate B:** At this point... Nobody talks to Juujou-san unless they have to.  
**Classmate B:** And most of the time, we can count on our class rep here to pass the important stuff along.  
**Sanae:** Maybe... I am being too nosy after all.  
**Sanae:** (...It's true that Juujou-san never goes out of her way to talk to anyone-- It looks like she does want to keep to herself... But.)  
**Sanae:** (I don't... want to leave her all alone.)  
**Sanae:** (If I don't do something, I'm not going to be able to change that--)  
**Classmate B:** I doubt you're going to change Juujou-san's mind, but isn't that okay? A class rep's supposed to be nosy.  
**Sanae:** Eh?  
**Classmate A:** She might be stubborn, but isn't Sanae pretty stubborn herself?  
**Classmate B:** Yeah, it'll be interesting to see which of them gives in first.  
**Sanae:** I-I'm not... I'm not that stubborn, okay?  
**Classmate B:** You say that, but... Right?  
**Classmate A:** Yeah. If that were the case, you wouldn't keep talking to her... She's seriously giving you the cold shoulder and all.  
**Sanae:** Mmmm, it's not that I want to agree with you, but I'm going to try and do everything I can.  
**Sanae:** (After all, if I just had the right chance, I might be able to shorten the distance between myself and Juujou-san.)  

## [Sanae Joins: End]: Distance of the Heart
**Sanae:** Thank you for being my partner in practical training earlier, Juujou-san. I learned a whole lot from getting to cross okatana with you.  
**Sanae:** Though, you were so fast I could barely keep up with you.  
**Hiyori:** ...What do you want from me?  
**Sanae:** Ahaha... Sorry for going on like that. I was wondering, is there any kind of trick to it? Like, some technique you use to stay so focused?  
**Hiyori:** Isn't that something you should be asking the teacher?  
**Sanae:** You're right about that, but, after seeing it for myself, I can't help but think, "How'd she do that?" You know?  
**Hiyori:** There's no trick to it. Even if there were, I couldn't teach it to you.  
**Hiyori:** ...If that's all you needed, then I'm leaving.  
**Sanae:** Ah, okay.  
**Sanae:** ......  
**Sanae:** (Why is it... that Juujou-san tries to keep so much distance from everyone?)  
**Sanae:** (Just by wanting to become a toji, she had to have known when she came here that working together with others was an essential part of stopping aradama...)  
**Sanae:** (If I knew the reason why, I'm not sure if it would solve anything, but... The way things are now, it's difficult... In a lot of ways.)  
**Sanae:** Maybe if I can just talk with her a little more...  
**Sanae:** Thanks for helping clean up. Are you free after school, Juujou-san?  
**Hiyori:** ...This again?  
**Sanae:** I found a shop that sells tasty ice cream. So I was thinking, maybe we could go together...?  
**Hiyori:** ......  
**Hiyori:** No thanks... I'm busy with something.  
**Sanae:** That's too bad. In that case, I can message you the name and location of the place for later.  
**Hiyori:** ...What are you after? Did the teacher tell you to do all this?  
**Sanae:** It's not like that. It's just, I want to be friends with you, Juujou-san.  
**Hiyori:** ......  
**Hiyori:** Sorry, but I don't feel the same way.  
**Sanae:** Ah, Juujou-san?  
**Hiyori:** ...Just forget about me. Can't you tell you're just wasting your time?  
**Sanae:** That isn't the case for me... But I guess I'm bothering you after all?  
**Hiyori:** ...I told you all I wanted to say.  
**Sanae:** ...Juujou-san.  
**Sanae:** Sigh... It isn't going very well at all...  
**Sanae:** (I might be annoying her... But, if I leave her alone... It feels like she'll disappear somewhere.)  
**Sanae:** (She reminds me a little of in elementary school, when a girl transferred away because of bullying. Especially with how things are in class...)  
**Sanae:** (Of course, Juujou-san is strong. I can feel a strong kind of conviction in her. I might not be able to help Juujou-san, and she might not even need it if I could.)  
**Sanae:** (But still...)  
**Sanae:** Maybe I'm just being selfish, but I want to be friends with her.  
**Sanae:** They say faith can move mountains, so I'll just have to keep going slow and steady. Mm!

## [Halloween 19 - Sanae: Start]: I'm a Bakeneko
**Hiyori:** You're going to be starring in a movie?  
**Sanae:** I-I am.  
**Sanae:** Umm, do you remember when Itomi-san was a stuntman for a movie that one time?  
**Sanae:** It sounds like the staff from that movie made another request, and it was decided that I would be helping them together with Itomi-san and Kitora-san.  
**Hiyori:** They probably picked Sayaka because of last time, but why were you chosen for this?  
**Sanae:** I think it's because I fit their image for the part? My hair's naturally wavy.  
**Hiyori:** Well, your hair does kind of have a life of its own... But what does that have to do with it?  
**Sanae:** It has a lot to do with it! After all, the part I'm playing is a bakeneko, a cat demon! See, doesn't it look sort of catlike?  
**Hiyori:** That's what you mean?  
**Hiyori:** I've worn a catgirl costume before too, but my hair's like this.  
**Sanae:** You were so cute back then, Juujou-san! You were all, "I'm a catgirl, nya-!"  
**Hiyori:** I-I wasn't getting that into it!  
**Sanae:** Huh, weren't you?  
**Hiyori:** I was not!  
**Hiyori:** Leaving that aside, so you'll be playing a bakeneko, huh... What kind of movie is it?  
**Sanae:** It's a horror movie with action elements. I'm going to be fighting against Kitora-san.  
**Hiyori:** Action between Iwakura-san and Mirja... It sounds like it'll be a great movie.  
**Sanae:** You think so?  
**Sanae:** This is my first time doing something like a movie... To tell the truth, I'm a little nervous.  
**Hiyori:** Everybody goes through their first time at some point. Besides, knowing you, you'll play the bakeneko part with all you've got, right?  
**Hiyori:** I think you'll be fine.  
**Sanae:** ...Thank you! I'll give it everything I've got!  
**Hiyori:** Sure. Anyway, when are they doing the filming?  
**Sanae:** That would be... On Halloween day.  
**Hiyori:** ...Oh. So then you won't be there with me on Halloween.  
**Sanae:** That's what I regret most about this...  
**Sanae:** I really wanted to see you in your vampire costume...  
**Hiyori:** You don't have to be that depressed about it. You can still see it, like in pictures.  
**Sanae:** That sounds perfect! You have to send me pictures, okay! I want to see shots of you and Etou-san together!  
**Hiyori:** Why do they have to be me with Kanami!?  

## [Halloween 19 - Sanae: End]: On to the Filming!
The day of the film shoot.

  
**Sanae:** The weather doesn't look too good, does it.  
**Mirja:** That's true, Iwakura Sanae. However, for a horror film, this might actually be considered good weather.  
**Sanae:** Ah, you have a point there.  
**Sanae:** But, all the same... They really are going to start filming, aren't they. I wonder if I can do this right...  
**Mirja:** Are you feeling nervous?  
**Sanae:** Extremely nervous!  
**Sanae:** Itomi-san, what was it like for you the last time you did this?  
**Sayaka:** What was it like?  
**Sanae:** Did you feel nervous at all, and things like that. I need to use you for reference!  
**Sayaka:** For reference...  
**Mirja:** Is something the matter with that?  
**Sayaka:** I don't know what to do, if you say you want to use me for reference... ...I don't really remember last time.  
**Sanae:** Eh-!? You don't remember it!?  
**Sayaka:** I just moved like they told me to, and then it was over before I noticed. That's why I think it'll go fine this time too.  
**Sanae:** Sh-She's a real big shot...  
**Staff:** It's showtime-. Iwakura-san and Kitora-san, please stand by for your scene-.  
**Sanae:** I-It's already starting!?  
**Sayaka:** You can do it, Sanae.  
**Sanae:** Y-Yeah... I'll do what I can!  
**Sanae:** ...[gulp]  
**Sanae:** (Right now, Kitora-san will be coming up from the first floor, so I have to frighten her...)  
**Mirja:** I-Is somebody there?  
**Sanae:** (Ahh, I'm so nervous I can't stop myself from smiling...! I have to stiffen up my face some more...!)  
**Mirja:** [pant, pant]...  
**Sanae:** (Mirja-san's raising the sense of tension... She's a good actor...)  
**Sanae:** (I-I'll have to try and keep up with her performance... One, two, and three...!)  
**Sanae:** UNYAAAAAA!  
**Mirja:** KYAAAAAAAAA!  
**Staff:** Okay, that's a wrap-.  
**Sanae:** Ahh, that was so nervewracking...  
**Mirja:** You did well, Iwakura Sanae. That was a good performance.  
**Sanae:** Thanks a lot, Kitora-san! I can't wait for it to be in theaters!  
**Mirja:** I understand the feeling. When that time comes, let's go and see it together.  
**Sanae:** Sure!

## [Summer Dress - Sanae: Start]: The Rain Comes Down
**Aradama:** GYAOOOOOOOOOOOOO!  
**Sanae:** Konohana-san! I cornered the aradama!  
**Sanae:** Please finish it off!  
**Suzuka:** You can leave it to me!  
**Suzuka:** HAAAAAAAAAA!  
**Aradama:** OOoo...  
**Suzuka:** This was the last of them now. You did well, Iwakura-san.  
**Sanae:** Thank you. You did well too, Konohana-san.  
**Sanae:** We finished our mission before the rain started...  
**Sanae:** ...Ah.  
**Sanae:** It's pouring now.  
**Suzuka:** Our expedition to Hokkaido coincided with the typhoon passing. There's little we could do about it.  
**Suzuka:** Let''s hurry on to our hotel before anything. If we stay here in the rain like this, we'll catch a cold.  
**Sanae:** Alright!  
**Sanae:** Oh, the rain stopped.  
**Suzuka:** Yes, the weather's nice out.  
**Suzuka:** Are you feeling a cold coming on, Iwakura-san?  
**Sanae:**ã€€I feel fine.  
**Sanae:** It's all because of the plan you came up with, Konohana-san. If we had been chasing down aradama in that rain, I might have caught one.  
**Suzuka:** Really now, even without my strategy, I think you would have been able to suppress them quickly enough.  
**Sanae:** Are you sure...?  
**Suzuka:** What do you doubt about that?  
**Sanae:** It's just, with my skills, I'm not sure I'd be able to beat them in time.  
**Sanae:** I'd probably still be out there even after the rain started...  
**Suzuka:** (She's sincerely concerned... What a straightforward person. Come to think of it, Iwakura-san is also from Heijou.)  
**Suzuka:** Fufu.  
**Sanae:** ? ...What's the matter?  
**Suzuka:** Oh, it's nothing.  
**Suzuka:** Anyway, before we stop in for the night, would you like to step out for a bit? We did manage to finish our mission earlier than planned.  
**Sanae:** Ah, I'd love to!  
**Sanae:** Since we came to Hokkaido, I was thinking I could try some of the jingisukan here, or their ice cream, or the seafood!  
**Suzuka:** Well now, it's all food.  
**Sanae:** Actually... Whenever I have time on an expedition assignment, I go on a gourmet tour.  
**Suzuka:** I think that's a fine interest to have. In that case, could I ask you to escort me around?  
**Sanae:** Sure! Leave it to me!  

  

## [Summer Dress - Sanae: End]: Looking Good With Sunflowers
**Sanae:** I found it, Konohana-san! That store's ramen is famous for its deliciousness!  
**Suzuka:** Ramen?  
**Sanae:** Yeah!  
**Sanae:** When it comes to noodles, I think mizusawa udon is the best, but I love ramen too!  
**Sanae:** Every region does it pretty differently, so it's interesting to see.  
**Suzuka:** What sort of ramen do they have in Hokkaido?  
**Sanae:** Miso ramen's definitely the most popular in Hokkaido, but they make tasty seafood flavored shio ramen too!  
**Suzuka:** I'll look forward to it.  
**Suzuka:** The ramen was delicious.  
**Sanae:** Wasn't it? I wasn't sure what to pick first, but I made the right choice with shio ramen.  
**Suzuka:** As a token of my thanks for the ramen, I'll show you to a place I recommend.   
**Sanae:** Somewhere you recommend?  
**Suzuka:** That's right.  
**Suzuka:** I thought I could also at least find one place to bring you, so I kept a special one in mind.  
**Sanae:** Woww... It's so pretty here...  
**Suzuka:** I'm glad to see it's to your liking.  
**Sanae:** Why did you choose here...?  
**Suzuka:** It fit the image I have of you, Iwakura-san.  
**Suzuka:** Sunflowers do suit you after all.  
**Sanae:** Sunflowers suit me...?  
**Suzuka:** They do. Sunflowers are a good fit for a toji with a straightforward, honest strength.  
**Sanae:** ...Thank you.  
**Sanae:** But, sunflowers really do suit you too, Konohana-san.  
**Suzuka:** Fufu, that would be nice.  
**Suzuka:** Anyway, it's about time we left.  
**Sanae:** Ah, for the shinkansen?  
**Suzuka:** No, for the flight I chartered. This will be faster than taking the shinkansen, won't it?  
**Sanae:** ......Th-That's true.  
**Sanae:** (Instead of sunflowers... maybe a more expensive flower would be better for Konohana-san.)  
**Suzuka:** What are you waiting for? We're going.  
**Sanae:** R-Right...

## [Xmas' 20 - Sanae: Start]: What Should I Go With?
**Sanae:** A Christmas party?  
**Hiyori:** Yeah, Kanami and everyone invited me, but, do you want to come too, Iwakura-san?  
**Sanae:** Thanks for the invitation, Juujou-san.  
**Sanae:** But... Is it really okay for me to be there?  
**Hiyori:** Of course it is.  
**Sanae:** Then, I'd be happy to go.  
**Hiyori:** Great.  
**Hiyori:** Ahh, that's right. We're going to be exchanging gifts that day, so be sure to have one ready.  
**Sanae:** Okay!  
**Sanae:** ...I said that, but, a gift exchange?  
**Sanae:** Etou-san, Juujou-san, Yanase-san, Itomi-san, Kohagura-san, Mashiko-san...  
**Sanae:** Hmm... What would be good to give them? Would it be okay if I just picked out something I liked?  
**Kiyoka:** Oh, Sanae-san?  
**Sanae:** Musumi-san...  
**Kiyoka:** I didn't expect to see you here! Are you out shopping?  
**Kiyoka:** The investigation team is having a party on Christmas, so I'm here to buy some things!  
**Sanae:** I'm sort of in the same boat.  
**Sanae:** I'm going to a party with Juujou-san, but they're going to be doing a gift exchange there, so...  
**Sanae:** ...  
**Sanae:** Could I ask you for a bit of advice on something, Musumi-san?  
**Kiyoka:** Ah, sure, of course. If I can help.  
**Sanae:** You see... I'm actually worried about what to get for the gift exchange. If it were you, what would you buy?  
**Kiyoka:** Hmm... That is a little tough to pick something out for.  
**Kiyoka:** If it were me... Let's see... I think I'd probably go with something consumable or that you could eat.  
**Kiyoka:** Because then, it would be fine no matter who gets it.  
**Sanae:** That makes sense... Thanks, Musumi-san.  
**Kiyoka:** Don't mention it! Good luck finding the right present!  
**Sanae:** Yeah.  

## [Xmas' 20 - Sanae: End]: I Don't Feel Like I Can Lose
**Aradama:** OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!  
**Man:** UWAHHHHHHH!?  
**Sanae:** HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!  
**Man:** Th-Thank you!  
**Sanae:** Are you hurt anywhere?  
**Man:** I-I'm fine.  
**Sanae:** Thank goodness... Then, please evacuate calmly!  
**Sanae:** I'll make sure to protect everyone!  
**Man:** Sure, we're counting on you, miss Toji!  
**Hiyori:** This turned into one mess of a Christmas.  
**Sanae:** Juujou-san... There's not much we can do about it; aradama don't care if it's Christmas.  
**Sanae:** But, did you finish getting everyone evacuated over there?  
**Hiyori:** Yeah. I came over to help you out, though... it looks like things are fine here.  
**Sanae:** Just about. You should go over to see how the others are doing.  
**Hiyori:** Got it.  
**Hiyori:** Ah, by the way. When we get back, could I give you my present?  
**Sanae:** ...Eh?  
**Hiyori:** We're probably not going to be having a party at this point, but... I'm pretty confident in the present I chose.  
**Sanae:** ...Okay.  
**Sanae:** Ah, could I ask you what you picked out?  
**Hiyori:** Christmas wagashi.  
**Hiyori:** There were lots of cute looking ones, so I had a hard time narrowing it down.  
**Sanae:** I'll bet... I'll look forward to it.  
**Sanae:** And then, I'll trade you my gift, Juujou-san. I went through a lot of ideas, but I settled on a handkerchief...  
**Hiyori:** I'll be sure to take good care of it.  
**Hiyori:** Anyway, I'll see you later.  
**Sanae:** Okay!  
**Aradama:** GYAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!  
**Sanae:** An aradama!?  
**Sanae:** Though... I wonder why. I don't feel like I could lose right now!
