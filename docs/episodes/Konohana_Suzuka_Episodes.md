## 1: Dance of the Ojou-samas
**Mai:** Good to see you, Konohana-san.  
**Suzuka:** And you as well, Yanase-san. It's been quite some time since we met at a social gathering.  
**Mai:** That's true. Lately, I've been spending more time on battlefields... Are you here accompanying your father as well, Konohana-san?  
**Suzuka:** Yes, networking is invaluable, after all. Meetings like this allow you to keep up with many people.  
**Suzuka:** And deepening your connections is never a waste.  
**Suzuka:** For the sake of the Konohana family, and more precisely, for my own sake.  
**Mai:** You've always had your act together. Compared to you, I--  
**Woman:** Kyaaaaa--!! L-Look outside; an aradama!!  
**Suzuka:** What was that!?  
**Mai:** What's it doing out here...?  
**Suzuka:** We can think about that later. First, we need to destroy that aradama. Will you help me?  
**Mai:** Yes, of course!  
**Suzuka:** Then, we shouldn't waste time. Let's show this aradama where it's not welcome.  
**Suzuka:** Nicely done. Thankfully, we were able to deal with this before it became a serious incident.  
**Mai:** I ended up on another battlefield, in the end.  
**Suzuka:** You're right, now that you mention it. Perhaps that's the fate of us toji.  
**Suzuka:** But, leaving that aside, you were about to say something strange before we were interrupted, weren't you?  
**Mai:** Something strange? Sorry, I don't really remember?  
**Suzuka:** "You've always had your act together. Compared to you, I--".  
**Suzuka:** Surely you don't mean to imply you haven't been an accomplished person yourself?  
**Mai:** I'm not implying anything; that's just how it is...  
**Suzuka:** That joke isn't as funny as you think.  
**Suzuka:** There aren't many who could repeat the way you handled your okatana just now.  
**Suzuka:** That beautiful swordsmanship could only belong to one who thoroughly dedicated herself to training every day.  
**Suzuka:** Therefore, please have more confidence in yourself. Your worries only weaken your resolve.  
**Mai:** Konohana-san... Thank you very much.  
**Suzuka:** You don't need to thank me.  
**Suzuka:** Now then... The party seems to still be open. I should take my leave.  
**Suzuka:** Farewell, Yanase-san. Until we meet on another battlefield.  
**Mai:** Yes! Until we fight together again.  

## 2: The Ojou-sama is a Commoner
**Maki:** What are you having for lunch, Suzuka?  
**Suzuka:** As for me, I've prepared this.  
**Maki:** That's... Another convenience store bento? How many days in a row is that?  
**Suzuka:** Unfortunately for you, that's wrong. This isn't a convenience store bento, but rather a bento from the supermarket's deli corner.  
**Suzuka:** And would you look at this, right here! I found it at a 30% discount! Such great value, isn't it?  
**Maki:** The ojou-sama is bragging about bargain bin deals...  
**Suzuka:** I can't overlook that. I've never once thought of myself as an ojou-sama, you know.  
**Maki:** If you aren't one, then what even is an ojou-sama?  
**Maki:** I've heard rumors that, in middle school, you rode in a different luxury car to school every day.  
**Suzuka:** ...? What's so strange about that?  
**Maki:** So it's true!? Why would you change cars every day? And luxury cars too!  
**Suzuka:** I'm sorry? You're the one saying strange things now. You change clothing every day, don't you? Why would cars be any different?  
**Maki:** Of course it's different!! Don't compare cars costing tens of millions of yen to clothes...!  
**Suzuka:** But outfits costing several tens of millions of yen aren't all that uncommon, are they?  
**Maki:** Your sense of money's insane... That reminds me. There's another rumor you were running late one day, so you had a helicopter airlift you to school.  
**Suzuka:** That's a misunderstanding. Even I've never flown in a helicopter to school.  
**Maki:** It figures, that one's just idle gossip...  
**Suzuka:** Yes, a helicopter wouldn't have made it in time. I rode a Harrier instead.  
**Maki:** Isn't that a fighter jet!? I knew it; you're an ojou-sama among ojou-samas.  
**Suzuka:** But I think I'm fairly ordinary, though?  
**Maki:** Do I even want to know your definition of ordinary...?  
**Maki:** Still, I'm surprised you not only go to convenience stores, but supermarkets too. Or do you have someone get these for you?  
**Suzuka:** I'd never have someone do that for me. You must not be aware, Maki-san. Of how wonderful the supermarket is.  
**Suzuka:** The shelves are brimming with an endless variety of foods, and simply browsing through their collection of sweets is a joy.  
**Suzuka:** There's so much to see that I could spend half a day there without losing interest in the slightest.  
**Suzuka:** Ah, I know! If you'd like, will you join me next time? I can guide you around.  
**Maki:** S-Sure...  

## 3: Suzuka's Duties
**Suzuka:** Excellent work. I'd expect no less from you, Yukari-sama. Even while negotiating with such veteran ministers, you didn't give an inch. It was a valuable learning experience.  
**Yukari:** With this, we should be able to act more freely. Another step toward my ideal.  
**Yukari:** We can begin as soon as this bill takes effect. I'll need you working harder than ever from here.  
**Suzuka:** I'm well aware. I'll gladly do everything I can to make your plans a reality, Yukari-sama.  
**Man:** .........  
**Suzuka:** What are you doing? Clear the way, you're being disrespectful.  
**Man:** ORIGAMIIIII!!  
**Yukari:** Hm, an insurgent?  
**Suzuka:** I won't allow it.  
**Man:** GYAAAHH!!  
**Suzuka:** Don't worry, I merely used the back of the blade. I wouldn't dirty Kujikanesada with the blood of a common rebel, after all.  
**Suzuka:** Honestly, for one as helpless as you to make an attempt on Yukari-sama's life was hopelessly naive.  
**Suzuka:** With an overambitious plan, someone must have put you up to it, didn't they?  
**Suzuka:** Prepare yourself. I'll have you tell me everything.  
**Man:** ....Ghkhg!!  
**Suzuka:** Wha!? What are you doing!?  
**Man:** .........  
**Suzuka:** He's dead... It seems he prepared a suicide capsule in the back of his teeth.  
**Suzuka:** This is inexcusable. To have lost such a valuable witness right from under me... Yukari-sama, I'll accept any punishment you give.  
**Yukari:** There's no need. I have no interest in every insect crawling the ground in my way.  
**Yukari:** As my desires are realized, many more like him will be flushed out. They're not all worth my attention. Leave him where he lies.  
**Suzuka:** ...Understood.  
**Yukari:** Now then, come with me.  
**Suzuka:** Yes! Wherever you go, I will be at your side!  

## 4: The Time we Spent Together
**Maki:** What's the matter; your attacks are getting softer. Tired already?  
**Suzuka:** Funny, coming from you. Your footwork is already slipping, Maki-san.  
**Maki:** Now you've said it. How about this!?  
**Suzuka:** Kuh...! How much longer can you go on!  
**Suzuka:** Hah--!!  
**Maki:** Oh, that was a good strike. For practice, you're sure coming at me with a lot of passion. Reminds me of when we first met!  
**Suzuka:** And you're taking this awfully casually, to go reminiscing about the past!  
**Maki:** That's not true. I'm barely holding my ground.  
**Suzuka:** (She's always grinning like that. Back then, I hated that smile from the bottom of my heart.)  
**Suzuka:** (Maki-san's okatana, "Usumidori", is of special importance to practitioners of Kurama-Ryu. I was deeply jealous of her.)  
**Suzuka:** ("Usumidori" was much more suited to be mine. I challenged her in the tournament, intending to prove that, but it ended in my defeat.)  
**Suzuka:** (With my pride deeply wounded, my spite for her only grew stronger. I swore I would someday surpass her.)  
**Suzuka:** (I even followed her as far as joining the elite guard.)  
**Maki:** What are you smiling about?  
**Suzuka:** Smiling? I was?  
**Maki:** Yeah. I couldn't believe it myself, but while you were fighting so passionately you had such a gentle smile on your face.  
**Maki:** Seriously, you're the one taking this casually, aren't you?  
**Suzuka:** I was simply reflecting on the past a little, is all.  
**Maki:** The past? I must not be a serious opponent for you, if you can happily walk down memory lane in the middle of a fight.  
**Suzuka:** Isn't that the case for you, Maki-san? You've done nothing but win against me lately. You have to be taking me lightly by now.  
**Maki:** Suzuka, to me you're a close friend I know I can rely on. But at the same time, I see you as my rival.  
**Maki:** Every day I'm trying desperately not to be outdone by you. You never give me a spare moment to take you lightly.  
**Suzuka:** ...!? You're always going on like that... Then, today's the day I overtake you!  
**Maki:** Not going to happen. Even in practice, you're the one person I never want to lose to!  
**Suzuka:** That's what I wanted to say! Regardless of anyone else, I have no intention of giving you an easy victory!  
**Suzuka:** Yah---!!  

## 5: The One at Your Side
**Naeba Wakako:** Suzuka-sama, isn't it about time we took a rest?  
**Wakako:** The sight of you at work is lovely enough to touch my heart, but without rest your body will start to suffer.  
**Wakako:** If your body were to give out on you... I wouldn't be able to go on living!  
**Suzuka:** You're always so dramatic. But, I do happen to be at a good stopping point. Let's pause here for now.  
**Wakako:** Suzuka-sama, um, here... Try these, if it suits you.  
**Suzuka:** My, what delicious looking tarts. Just look at how the fruits are glistening. Where did you find these?  
**Wakako:** There's a shop I often see featured in magazines; they made them. Actually, these tarts are so famous they regularly sell out the moment the shop opens.  
**Suzuka:** Really? You did well in getting them then.  
**Wakako:** Yes, I was waiting in line since three this morning!  
**Suzuka:** Y-You arrived that early?  
**Wakako:** I worked my hardest to ensure you could eat them, Suzuka-sama!  
**Suzuka:** I appreciate your dedication, but there's no need to go to such unreasonable lengths. It would be a serious issue if you came down ill as a result.  
**Wakako:** Suzuka-sama is worried about me... My heart feels like it could leap from my chest! I think I could live the rest of my life on those words alone!  
**Suzuka:** Fufu, you sure love to exaggerate.  
**Maki:** Sorry to interrupt. Suzuka, I brought orders for you.  
**Suzuka:** Ara, Maki-san, you didn't have to come all this way to deliver them.  
**Maki:** It's a part of the job; don't worry about it. I skimmed over it earlier. Our next mission seems fairly challenging.  
**Suzuka:** Ara, are you losing your nerve? Don't worry, I'll cover your share of the work if you need me.  
**Maki:** Who said anything like that!? I only wanted to warn you it looks difficult! It won't be a problem for me!  
**Suzuka:** Is that so? In any case, you can always depend on me being there to support you.  
**Maki:** That's what I should be saying...  
**Wakako:** ...I'm really not fit to be the one standing at Suzuka-sama's side, am I. She looks so much more splendid together with Maki-sama...  
**Suzuka:** Hm? Were you saying something, Wakako?  
**Wakako:** N-N-No! Pay no attention to me.  

## [Bride '19: Start]: Undercover Investigation (Suzuka's Case)
**Maki:** An undercover investigation?  
**Suzuka:** Yes, we will be going undercover.  
**Suzuka:** Another report has come in from that wedding chapel of an aradama stealing a wedding ring.  
**Maki:** Which means, someone will have to dress like a bride to lure the aradama out?  
**Maki:** Should we defeat the aradama there though? Shouldn't we work to get the stolen ring back?  
**Suzuka:** No, we have a ring equipped with a transmitter, so we only need the aradama to steal it.  
**Maki:** I see, that makes sense.  
**Maki:** So you'll be the bride, the aradama will steal the ring, we track where it goes, and this will all be solved.  
**Suzuka:** Eh!?  
**Maki:** Did I get something wrong?  
**Suzuka:** N-No... Only, I'll be the bride? The members from the previous mission have all been gathered...  
**Maki:** Of course, if there's a chance you'll be in danger, I'll be right there to protect you. But wouldn't it be best if we were the ones doing the dangerous work?  
**Suzuka:** Y-You do have a point.  
**Maki:** And besides, instead of someone like me, you'd make a much more convincing bride, Suzuka.  
**Suzuka:** V-Very well then. I'll play the bride to the best of my ability.  
**Suzuka:** There, I've put it on. Hopefully it can convince the aradama I'm a true bride...  
**Suzuka:** (Nonetheless... The design of this wedding dress is exquisite.)  
**Suzuka:** ...Does it suit me, I wonder?  
**Suzuka:** Even though I should be accustomed to wearing dresses... It's strange. I'm feeling slightly nervous.  
**Suzuka:** ...Fu.  
**Suzuka:** Maki-san? ...I've finished changing.  
**Suzuka:** ...Maki-san?  
**Chapel Staff:** Oh, if you're looking for Shidou-san, she said she would patrol the chapel while you get changed.  
**Suzuka:** How typical of her.  
**Suzuka:** It would be a waste to wait for her return, so I'll go on patrol as well.  
**Chapel Staff:** Of course, please do.  
**Suzuka:** ...May I ask you something?  
**Chapel Staff:** What's that?  
**Suzuka:** ...This doesn't look strange on me, does it?  
**Chapel Staff:** No, it's a perfect fit.  
**Suzuka:** Thank you very much... Don't tell anyone I asked that, will you?  

## [Bride '19: End]: You're Late, You know?
**Suzuka:** I said I would search for Maki-san, but it's difficult to cover such a large area.  
**Suzuka:** Oh? Over there, that's... Yomi-san, Ban-san. So you two were stationed here.  
**Yomi:** Yes.  
**Tsugumi:** Satsuki-san, shouldn't you say something more? On average, brides enjoy compliments.  
**Yomi:** You look very nice, Konohana-san.  
**Suzuka:** Well, I do appreciate the flattery.  
**Suzuka:** But more importantly, have either of you seen Maki-san around?  
**Tsugumi:** Shidou-san? I haven't seen her.  
**Yomi:** I spoke with her a little about our patrols.  
**Suzuka:** How long ago was that?  
**Yomi:** Only a few minutes ago. She went to look for where security was light.  
**Suzuka:** Light security... Thank you, Yomi-san.  
**Suzuka:** If she went to where there was little security, this should be a likely area...  
**Kiyoka:** Oh, Konohana-sa... Wow, that's so pretty.  
**Ellen:** Hanahana, you look amazing in that wedding dress!  
**Ellen:** I wish I could wear one too!  
**Suzuka:** Fufu, thank you. Have you seen Maki-san around?  
**Ellen:** Makimaki was right here with us until a moment ago. I think she's still nearby!  
**Kiyoka:** Ah! You want Shidou-san to see you in your wedding dress, don't you!  
**Suzuka:** All I want is to perform our mission, which I need to find her for.  
**Suzuka:** ...Musumi-san? We mustn't confuse our private interests with our duties.  
**Kiyoka:** I-I'm sorry.  
**Suzuka:** Please focus your attention on securing the area, will you?  
**Suzuka:** ...Really now, it's all because Musumi-san had to say something strange that I'm somewhat nervous again... Ah.  
**Maki:** ......  
**Suzuka:** ...! M-Maki-san?  
**Maki:** Oh, Suzuka. Looks like you're done getting changed.  
**Suzuka:** Y-Yes.  
**Maki:** There's been no sign of anything here. The spectrum finder hasn't responded either, so it doesn't seem like the aradama is around.  
**Suzuka:** ...  
**Maki:** Suzuka?  
**Suzuka:** Ah, it's nothing... Its target must be the ring after all.  
**Maki:** That's right, we should get it ready now.  
**Suzuka:** Yes.  
**Suzuka:** (Honestly, why did I expect anything more from Maki-san... I feel like a fool for ever getting nervous.)  
**Maki:** Suzuka?  
**Suzuka:** I'll have the ring ready in a moment. The other toji have taken their positions, so we can start...  
**Maki:** No, I didn't mean that... You look good.  
**Suzuka:** Ah... Fufu, I'm glad to hear that, Maki-san.

## [Valentines Suzuka: Start]: A Similar Pair?
**Mirja:** As of now, there is only one more confirmed target in the shopping mall. Do you see it on the spectrum finder?  
**Aradama:** ...Ggii.  
**Suzuka:** There it is.  
**Suzuka:** (Rather than giving chase now with the two of us, it would be more effective to form a pincer attack. If these aradama are truly after the chocolate, then it shouldn't run to the other floors, but instead to the food court.)  
**Suzuka:** (There is only one route it can take to there. Our strategy should be for Kitora Mirja to circle around, and--)  
**Mirja:** I'll circle around to the food court! Konohana Suzuka, you drive the aradama forward. As a precaution, I'll contact Kohagura and Tsubakuro as I move.  
**Suzuka:** !  
**Suzuka:** Good, I won't object to that.  
**Suzuka:** Destroying them is most important, however--  
**Aradama:** ...GGGIII-!  
**Suzuka:** It won't make it so easy, will it.  
**Suzuka:** Though, even if you run, I'll guide your every move.  
**Aradama:** GSHAA---!  
**Mirja:** Just as planned. It's coming directly here.  
**Mirja:** However, I won't so lenient as to let such a mindless charge through!  
**Suzuka:** Well done.  
**Mirja:** Bringing it down was nothing. You had the more difficult role of guiding it here.  
**Suzuka:** It might have been on the run, but that aradama would have only gone to where the chocolate is located, so it was hardly a challenge.  
**Mirja:** I see. Though, shouldn't you have been able to bring that aradama down?  
**Suzuka:** There are many things left unconfirmed about these aradama, so I decided to rely on the more certain method of a pincer attack. If you hadn't proposed the idea, I would have.  
**Suzuka:** I realize we are operating in two man teams during this mission, but it's been simple to carry out with how clear each other's intentions are.  
**Mirja:** I felt the same. I can follow on your sensible instructions without hesitation. The elite guard must operate very smoothly.  
**Suzuka:** I never give detailed instructions to the elite guard.  
**Suzuka:** The primary role of the elite guard is to escort Yukari-sama, so when carrying out large scale operations, I and Maki-san will take command of our own units.  
**Mirja:** Now that you mention it, that is certainly true. Hm...  
**Mirja:** While we are on the topic of the elite guard, what sort of person is Shidou Maki? How do you see her?  
**Suzuka:** Eh? W-What do... you mean by that...?  
**Mirja:** I have somewhat of an interest in Shidou Maki myself.  
**Mirja:** I'm not sure if you are aware, but in the tournament the year before last, I was defeated by her.  
**Mirja:** As I see her, she is a straightforward toji with a single-minded strength. Every one of her strikes had great force behind it.  
**Mirja:** However, as someone who is close at her side, I was wondering if you had a different impression.  
**Suzuka:** Is that all you meant. Though, I don't think my impression differs much from yours? There's no hidden side to speak of when it comes to Maki-san.  
**Suzuka:** Well, if I had to name something, she can be quite dense at times.  
**Mirja:** Is that so? She doesn't at all give that impression when fighting.  
**Mirja:** Thank you for answering such a trivial question of mine.  
**Suzuka:** It was nothing. Now then, why don't we make our way back.  

## [Valentines Suzuka: End]: The Reason Behind Her Enthusiasm
**Patissier:** Sure, that would be fine. I can teach you some relatively simple tricks to making delicious chocolate even at home.  
**Suzuka:** Thank you very much. It won't be an issue for you to teach them to me, will it?  
**Patissier:** Well, it shouldn't be a problem so long as you don't go spreading online that it was our shop that taught it to you.  
**Patissier:** We're very grateful to all you toji. You're spending your spare time helping us, aren't you?  
**Patissier:** It's probably because you're all so cute, but we're selling more chocolate this year than usual.  
**Suzuka:** Well now. In that case, I'll gladly learn what you have to teach me.  
**Patissier:** Then, we can do it after we close up for the day. But, you must be tired from your duties, so don't push yourself, okay?  
**Suzuka:** Of course; thank you for your concern.  
**Ellen:** We're back-! I had a pretty exciting experience, fighting with Yumecchi out there.  
**Yume:** Really? I was just fighting like I normally do~.  
**Ellen:** You were really leading the way with how we were fighting before. It seems like anyone would have a hard time keeping up with you.  
**Yume:** Ah, now that we're here, I wanna eat some cake!  
**Ellen:** That's a good idea! I'm a little hungry myself.  
**Yume:** What should I have today~? Mont blanc? Or pudding a la mode... Mmm, I think I'll go with the strawberry rare cheesecake after all~.  
**Suzuka:** Strawberry is one of your favorites, isn't it, Yume. You like Ichigo Daifuku Neko as well, don't you?  
**Yume:** Yeah, I guess it is~.  
**Suzuka:** Once you've finished eating, can I count on you to help us with managing the shop?  
**Suzuka:** I'll go ahead and get changed first.  
**Yume:** Sure sure-. You don't have to worry about me-.  
**Suzuka:** Thank you very much for your order. We hope to see you again.  
**Yume:** Thank you very much~...  
**Yume:** Suzuka-onee-san, is it me, or are you acting extra excited today?  
**Suzuka:** I don't think that's the case? This is how I always am.  
**Yume:** Ehh, but I feel like something's different for sure-. Ah, maybe you got a special kind of cake!  
**Suzuka:** If I had gotten a cake like that, I would have shared it with you, Yume.  
**Yume:** Hmm, I guess you would've. Then maybe I imagined it? But still...  
**Suzuka:** (I should have expected no less from Yume... She's so perceptive when it comes to the strangest things. I think it would be fine to tell her about being taught the tricks to making chocolate though.)  
**Suzuka:** (But, until Valenties day, I cannot allow Maki-san to find out.)  
**Suzuka:** (I'm only erring on the side of caution. Sorry, Yume.)  
**Suzuka:** (I'm sure the store's products would be more delicious, but I'm a bit interested in seeing Maki-san's reaction when I tell the chocolates I gave her are homemade.)  
**Suzuka:** Though, it is Maki-san after all. I'm sure she's no stranger to homemade chocolate.  
**Yume:** What's that about Maki-onee-san?  
**Suzuka:** Nothing at all. It isn't much longer until closing time, so let's give one last effort.  
**Yume:** You really are acting kinda suspicious today, Suzuka-onee-san~...

## [Xmas' 19 - Suzuka: Start]: A Place to Hide a Present
**Maki:** Suzuka, did something happen for you to call me over here?  
**Suzuka:** I'm sorry to do this when things are so busy at the end of the year. But actually, I'd like to discuss something with you.  
**Maki:** Discuss what?  
**Suzuka:** It's about the birthday present we bought for Yomi-san the other day.  
**Maki:** Oh yeah. We picked out a great present thanks to you. I'm looking forward to surprising her with it. But, what about it?  
**Suzuka:** You see, I had hidden it in the back of the record room so that Yomi-san wouldn't find it until the 24th...  
**Maki:** Don't tell me she found it!?  
**Suzuka:** No, I was able to retrieve it just in time, but Yomi-san' intuition is sharp. I'm not quite sure how to keep it a secret until the day of.  
**Maki:** I get it. You're right, that's an important discussion to have.  
**Suzuka:** To begin with, anywhere we can enter, Yomi-san freely enters as well...  
**Maki:** And if we kept it in our living quarters, Yume would likely find it whenever she comes in to play around.  
**Suzuka:** In previous years, we prepared it together with Yume, so the three of us could have kept it a secret between us.  
**Maki:** But she went and said she'd do something on her own this year. I want to keep it secret from Yume too if possible...  
**Yomi:** Konohana-san, you were in here?  
**Suzuka:** Y-Yomi-san! Hadn't you gone off on an assignment?  
**Yomi:** I was called in by Yukari-sama. I'm supposed to bring you with me as well.  
**Suzuka:** Yukari-sama asked for you and myself? Very well then. We can leave in a moment. Though...  
**Maki:** I'll take care of the present for now. If you think of a good place to store it, send me a message.  
**Suzuka:** Alright then. Do your best to keep it a secret.  
**Yukari:** Konohana, Satsuki, the two of you will be undertaking a special mission.  
**Suzuka:** I understand. Ask us to do whatever is needed.  
**Yomi:** Yes, whatever the mission entails, we will carry it out flawlessly.  
**Yukari:** Those are encouraging responses. Your mission is set to take place on December 25th.  
**Yukari:** Dressed in Santa Claus outfits, I want you to visit locations where the local children gather and distribute presents prepared by the Origami family.  
**Suzuka/Yomi:** Eh...?  
**Yukari:** What, are you dissatisfied with that?  
**Suzuka:** Not at all; I think it's a wonderful idea! Yukari-sama, thank you for offering us this lovely mission.  
**Yomi:** So long as you order it, I'll tend to it quickly, Yukari-sama.  
**Yukari:** The presents have already been set aside in the storehouse. I leave it to you to decide how to distribute them. Is that clear?  
**Suzuka:** Yes ma'am!  
**Yomi:** There's a mountain of presents...  
**Suzuka:** Would you look at that! Each of them is so neatly wrapped; just the sight of it gives me a thrill!  
**Yomi:** Does it...  
**Suzuka:** They're all so cute, and yet you don't seem interested in the slightest, Yomi-san...  
**Suzuka:** Ahh! That's right! I could try that!  
**Yomi:** Konohana-san? Is something wrong?  
**Suzuka:** (Fufu, I've come up with an excellent idea of how to hide Yomi-san's present.)  

## [Xmas' 19 - Suzuka: End]: Present For You
December 25th.

  
**Suzuka:** Merry Christmas, to all you good girls and boys! These are presents from the Origami family. Please, come right up and have one~.  
**Boy 1:** Ehh-! Can I really have one?  
**Child's Mother:** Thank you very much.  
**Boy 2:** Santa-onee-san! Please give me a present too!  
**Girl 1:** Me too-!  
**Suzuka:** Oh my, we're completely surrounded by children now. Yomi-san, are you alright over there?  
**Yomi:** .........  
**Yomi:** Will all the children please calm down. Plenty of presents have been prepared. They will be distributed as quickly as we are able, so please form a line and stand silently for your turn.  
**Suzuka:** Yomi-san! If you use such difficult words, you won't get through to them.  
**Yomi:** I'm sorry. I'm unused to working with children...  
**Suzuka:** There's no helping that then. Yomi-san, I'll give an example of what to do, so try mimicking me to start. Here I go.  
**Suzuka:** If any of our little friends would like a present, please line up in front of us onee-sans~!  
**Children:** Okaaay!  
**Yomi:** I see, bring yourself down to their level, and speak plainly to them... I'll try it.  
**Yomi:** Everyone, if you want a present, please line up. Will everyone who wants a present please line up.  
**Suzuka:** All the presents were peacefully handed out. You did well, Yomi-san.  
**Yomi:** ......  
**Suzuka:** Are you feeling too tired to have much to say? Though, because of your efforts today, you brought happiness to plenty of children.  
**Yomi:** Do you think so?  
**Suzuka:** I do. And that Santa bag you're holding is the proof of it. Isn't the inside filled with objects of their gratitude?  
**Yomi:** Yes; letters, drawings, candies, and chocolate. I never expected them to give me so many gifts in return.  
**Suzuka:** With this, we should be able to give a good report to Yukari-sama.  
**Yomi:** That's true.  
**Yomi:** By the way, Konohana-san. You've been carefully holding onto one present for a while now. Did you forget to distribute it?  
**Yomi:** Our mission today was to deliver every last one of the presents. We should hurry and find a child to deliver it to.  
**Suzuka:** There won't be any need for that. This here is Maki-san and my birthday present to you, Yomi-san.  
**Yomi:** For... me?  
**Suzuka:** With all the confusion surrounding the party and our missions, we ended up a day late, but Yomi-san, we wish you a happy birthday.  
**Yomi:** Konohana-san...  
**Suzuka:** Fufu, and I'll take a photo of the moment of our successful surprise. Maki-san on her expedition assignment should be glad to see this.  
**Yomi:** Thank you for your gift. I'm grateful for your thoughtfulness.  
**Suzuka:** You're very perceptive, Yomi-san, so we were anxious you might find your present before we could give it to you.  
**Suzuka:** We were very lucky to keep it a secret until today. I suppose you hide a tree in a forest, and a present among gifts.

## [Special Defense Team - Suzuka: Start]: Suzuka of the Special Defense Team
**Suzuka:** Now then, I'll go about explaining our next mission.  
**Maki:** We're suppressing aradama, right?  
**Suzuka:** Yes, it will be a bit of a trip. It's been some time since you and I took an assignment together, Maki-san.  
**Maki:** With both of us, it'd be extremely unlikely anything goes wrong, but... It hasn't been long since we were put in the special defense team.  
**Maki:** Let's keep ourselves focused.  
**Suzuka:** Of course.  
**Suzuka:** Even seen favorably, the special defense team is simply a re-organizing of the old Origami family elite guard.  
**Suzuka:** There are still those keeping a harsh eye on us now, so all we can do is to continue producing results.  
**Suzuka:** I don't see any... responses to aradama.  
**Maki:** Doesn't seem like there's any around here. If we had Yomi with us right about now...  
**Suzuka:** She would have found them easily.  
**Suzuka:** Yet...  
**Suzuka:** Though we were re-assembled directly under Akane-sama... If the four of us were to be acting together, it would invite needless suspicion.  
**Suzuka:** We need to endure it for the time being.  
**Maki:** We can't let pointless gossip make Yukari-sama's situation worse than it already is.  
**Maki:** ...I'm going to hang around here a little longer. What about you, Suzuka?  
**Suzuka:** Let's see... We should rest for the night.  
**Maki:** Got it. You go on back first, Suzuka.  
**Suzuka:** No, you'll be coming back with me, Maki-san.  
**Maki:** If you're worried about me, don't be. An aradama's not going to get the better of me just because I lost one night of sleep.  
**Suzuka:** I believe you. But, what if it's two nights instead of one? What if we still haven't found the aradama then?  
**Suzuka:** Do you plan on keeping yourself awake all this time?  
**Maki:** Then I'll...  
**Suzuka:** It would be too much, even for you. Wouldn't it, Maki-san?  
**Suzuka:** If all you do is stretch yourself thin, you'll break in no time.  
**Maki:** ...You're right. Alright, Suzuka.  
**Maki:** I'll go rest too.  

## [Special Defense Team - Suzuka: End]: In Harmony
**Suzuka:** Nn...  
**Suzuka:** (It's still dark out, and yet I'm awake now... Oh?)  
**Suzuka:** (Maki-san is looking outside...?)  
**Maki:** ......  
**Suzuka:** Maki-san?  
**Maki:** Suzuka... Did I wake you?  
**Suzuka:** You didn't... What time is it now?  
**Maki:** It just turned five.  
**Suzuka:** Not much longer till the sunrise then.  
**Suzuka:** Nnnh......! Have you been up like this the whole time?  
**Maki:** No, I only just got up myself. If I didn't sleep properly, somebody'd get mad at me.  
**Suzuka:** Oh my, is there someone so frightening as to get angry with the former first seat of the elite guard?  
**Maki:** Yeah, she's always around. It's a real help.  
**Suzuka:** Maki-san!  
**Maki:** Suzuka, get ready quick! We're leaving!  
**Suzuka:** YAAH!  
**Aradama:** OOOOoooo...  
**Maki:** There's more than expected... HAAH!!  
**Suzuka:** We made the right choice to get a good night's rest.  
**Maki:** That's for sure.  
**Suzuka:** Maki-san, feel free to move as you please. I'll stay with you and cover your blind spot.  
**Maki:** I'll be fine if you move freely yourself, Suzuka. I can at least tell where your blind spot is.  
**Suzuka:** Are you sure?  
**Maki:** Yeah, leave it to me.  
**Suzuka:** ......  
**Suzuka/Maki:** HAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!  
**Aradama:** GYOOOOoooo...  
**Maki:** How's that?  
**Suzuka:** We've still only brought down two of them. We'll keep going at this pace!  
**Maki:** Of course!  
**Suzuka:** (Honestly... Your back is so warm.)

## [Misogi - Suzuka: Start]: Someone I Can't Take My Mind Off Of
**Yukari:** Shidou, Konohana, I want the both of you to leave to conduct an inspection tomorrow.  
**Suzuka:** Will you not be traveling with us, Yukari-sama?  
**Yukari:** That's right; there's other business I'll have to attend to. I'd like for you two to handle this.  
**Yukari:** The details will be sent to you later, but essentially...  
**Yukari:** The idea is to have two active duty toji give their perspective on plans made with the railway association to resolve issues dispatching toji to sites of aradama outbreaks.  
**Maki:** Yes ma'am!  
**Suzuka:** Understood.  
**Yukari:** Konohana, after accompanying me to several inspections, you should have an idea of what to do. Give Shidou your support.  
**Suzuka:** Certainly.  
**Maki:** I'll be counting on you.  
**Suzuka:** (Yukari-sama said to support Maki-san, but, even without me, she likely would have been fine on her own.)  
**Maki:** ......  
**Suzuka:** (Shidou Maki... Even before facing each other in the finals of the tournament, I was already aware of her. Being the owner of that okatana, Usumidori.)  
**Suzuka:** (Usumidori has a deep connection to my Kurama-ryu... I had expected to inherit it myself one day. But, it never happened.)  
**Suzuka:** (Ever since then, I think... I might have been conscious of her.)  
**Suzuka:** (And-- then came the tournament where I'd been determined to prove my superiority over her. Only to be defeated in the end... What's worse, it happened two years in a row.)  
**Maki:** ...zuka?  
**Suzuka:** (Even now, after following her into the elite guard, I can't help but never want to be outdone by her.)  
**Maki:** Suzuka. Um... It's awkward, with you staring at me not saying anything... If something's bothering you, could you tell me?  
**Suzuka:** ...!? Ahem... I'm very sorry about that. I was just a bit lost in thought.  
**Maki:** Oh.  
**Suzuka:** ......  
**Maki:** You really helped me out today. I'm glad you came along.  
**Suzuka:** ...Maki-san?  
**Maki:** Suppressing aradama is one thing, but I still can't get used to this inspection stuff.  
**Maki:** Even when they go over it for me, I can't come up with a lot more than, "Ahh, so that's how it is."  
**Maki:** Compared to me, you're incredible.  
**Suzuka:** Wh-Where is all this coming from?  
**Maki:** Weren't you asking all the right questions?  
**Maki:** If it had been just me, I wouldn't have been able to come back with a report that'd make Yukari-sama happy.  
**Suzuka:** ...That's the entire reason I was here. There's no reason for you to be concerned about it.  
**Suzuka:** More importantly, what are you thinking, flaunting your weakness in front of me like that?  
**Maki:** ...What do you mean?  
**Suzuka:** I'm shocked is all. You used to be so stubborn, and yet you seem to have grown awfully open minded.  
**Maki:** You're good with situations like those, right? Since you know how to look at things from different angles.  
**Maki:** All I was thinking all day was, I'm really glad someone as reliable as you is with me.  
**Suzuka:** Wha...!  
**Maki:** I still keep it in mind; how you told me it'd be better if we took on different roles that show the best of our abilities.  
**Suzuka:** ...If that's all this is about, then that's fine.  
**Suzuka:** (Maki-san has been like this ever since we agreed to start calling each other by our first names...)  
**Suzuka:** (...It makes me seem strange for being the only one so wary around her...!)  
**Suzuka:** (Really... Maki-san, you're just so...)  

## [Misogi - Suzuka: End]: Crossing Okatana as a Refresher
**Suzuka:** Maki-san. You've left a few errors in this paperwork, you know?  
**Maki:** I did? Sorry; could I fix it up later? I'm running short on time.  
**Suzuka:** It's not an issue. I've already corrected them for you.  
**Maki:** Thanks for that. Anyway, I'd better get going.  
**Yume:** Hey, hey, Suzuka-onee-san. Aren't you kinda getting friendlier with Maki-onee-san now? You are, right?  
**Suzuka:** Nothing's changed between us in the slightest.  
**Yume:** Ehh; you're definitely friendlier now!  
**Suzuka:** (She's not wrong... It feels as if there's less distance between Maki-san and myself...)  
**Suzuka:** (But, even so... I still want to make up for the losses I suffered to her...)  
**Suzuka:** Sigh...  
**Suzuka:** (How can I relieve these pent up feelings... It seems I'll have to do something to refresh myself.)  
**Maki:** This is the first time we've fought seriously since the tournament, isn't it?  
**Suzuka:** Thank you very much for accepting my sudden proposal.  
**Maki:** It's fine by me.  
**Suzuka:** ...This time, I'll be victorious.  
**Maki:** I'm not planning on losing either.  
**Suzuka:** Good. There wouldn't be much point if you were.  
**Maki:** Then, let's get started. Come at me whenever.  
**Suzuka:** I'll take you up on that then!  
**Suzuka:** EII--!  
**Maki:** Ggh... You're especially aggressive today.  
**Suzuka:** I can't have you thinking... I'll only stay the same old Konohana Suzuka--!!  
**Maki:** Having you come at me head on's kind of exciting.  
**Suzuka:** Don't you think... you're talking a little too much?  
**Maki:** You're right; let's leave it at that. Here I come.  
**Maki:** --YAAAAAAHH!  
**Suzuka:** (She really is... so strong! Her strikes so straightforward... so heavy!)  
**Suzuka:** (Even still, I won't lose!)  
**Suzuka:** HAAAAAH!  
**Maki:** [pant... pant... pant...]  
**Suzuka:** I'm beaten... It's your win.  
**Maki:** That was a great match. You really are amazing. You had me scrambling to keep up; I've never seen you fight like that before.  
**Maki:** Let's keep getting stronger like that together, to support Yukari-sama.  
**Suzuka:** (That attitude of hers-- As straightforward as her swordsmanship. Maybe that's what Usumidori recognized in her.)  
**Suzuka:** (This marks my third consecutive defeat. And yet...)  
**Suzuka:** Of course. But, someday, I will overtake you. ...I hope you won't grow complacent, unless you'd like me to take your precious okatana off your hands.  
**Maki:** I'm glad for the competition. I won't be losing either; I'll show you how strong I can get.  
**Suzuka:** Take good care of Usumidori for me.  
**Maki:** Course I will. That's my trusty partner you're talking about.
