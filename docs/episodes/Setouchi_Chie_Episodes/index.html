By the way, Cherry, there&#x27;s something I want you to do for me.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Is that a new nickname? Cherry...<br>
<strong>Emily:</strong> Chie, Cherry, it&#x27;s all the same, isn&#x27;t it?<br>
<strong>Emily:</strong> Ahh, I almost forgot. Today&#x27;s request is about that thing handed down through the Mashiko family. You know.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Thing? You mean Nene? He&#x27;s always hanging around Mashiko-san. What do you want with him?<br>
<strong>Emily:</strong> Mm, first, take a look at this recording. 3... 2... 1... Begin playback!<br>
<strong>Emily:</strong> Well? How&#x27;d you like my camerawork?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> I already know the answer, but... Are you always doing this stuff?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Filming the Special Ritual Squad like that is already breaking regulations, but... You&#x27;re really bothering them by getting in their way to film while they&#x27;re trying to actually work...<br>
<strong>Emily:</strong> ...Ahem. Now then, take a look at this part again. Mashiko Kaoru-san&#x27;s okatana, Nenekirimaru, goes flying through the air.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> She threw it, didn&#x27;t she?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> I&#x27;m more interested in why Mashiko-san was just standing around doing nothing in the middle of a mission, actually.<br>
<strong>Emily:</strong> More importantly, take a closer look at this analysis with a slow motion camera. Here you can see Nene pulling it along.<br>
<strong>Emily:</strong> It&#x27;s not necessarily in the field my research team is covering, but... For an aradama to make an okatana fly like that... Don&#x27;t you see the potential here?<br>
<strong>Emily:</strong> If we could reproduce the effects by lining an okatana&#x27;s mountings with noro... No, if we could reproduce Nene itself through cloning perhaps, more toji would be able to make use of this flying okatana technique.<br>
<strong>Emily:</strong> Now this is where you come in, Cherry. I need you to go out and capture this &quot;Nene&quot;...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Emily?<br>
<strong>Emily:</strong> Of course, I will pay you for this...<br>
<em>Chie gives Emily a noogie</em></p><p><strong>Chie:</strong> Stop talking. There&#x27;s no way I&#x27;d help you with something as horrible as capturing Mashiko-san&#x27;s important partner!<br>
<strong>Emily:</strong> Ow ow! Grinding my forehead like that is off limits! Really! You&#x27;re always so kind to your juniors, Cherry! Why won&#x27;t you be my onee-san too!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> ...We&#x27;re in the same grade, you know. You&#x27;re a little old for that.<br>
<strong>Emily:</strong> Now that you mention it!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="2-the-girl-who-was-a-crybaby"></a>2: The Girl Who Was a Crybaby<a class="hash-link" href="#2-the-girl-who-was-a-crybaby" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Chie:</strong> It&#x27;s been a while, Yoshizumi-san.<br>
<strong>Asakura Yoshizumi:</strong> Oh, Chie-san. You don&#x27;t have to be so formal. I don&#x27;t mind if you call me Grandpa like you used to.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Then, Grandpa Asakura... It really does feel more natural. You should go back to calling me Chie-chan too.<br>
<strong>Yoshizumi:</strong> I see, so you&#x27;ve been working as a toji at Osafune. Does that mean you&#x27;ve grown out of being &quot;Crybaby Chii-chan&quot;?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Please don&#x27;t bring that up. That was a long time ago...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Yoshizumi:</strong> Hm? What&#x27;s wrong?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Maybe I haven&#x27;t grown out of it. All I ever do is find things to cry about. I keep making new regrets.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> When we were kids, Mihono-chan went to stop some older boys from picking on me, and she ended up getting hurt...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Even at Minoseki, it&#x27;s thanks to me that she ended up fighting her friend... And it&#x27;s all my fault she got wrapped up in this to begin with...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> ...I&#x27;m sorry, Grandpa. I feel like... I have to apologize. It&#x27;s all because of me that Mihono-chan is in this mess...<br>
<strong>Yoshizumi:</strong> ...That&#x27;s not true. Don&#x27;t worry, Mihono got into this of her own accord. I have no doubt she would have gotten into trouble all on her own.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> You don&#x27;t know the full story! Mihono-chan did nothing wrong... She did the right thing...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> I promised back then... That I&#x27;d become a better onee-chan for her, but...<br>
<strong>Yoshizumi:</strong> ...Hmm. I might not know all that happened, but... I think you&#x27;ve become a bit too much of a perfectionist.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Yoshizumi:</strong> Listen here.<br>
<strong>Yoshizumi:</strong> There&#x27;s nothing wrong with striving to be perfect. But people don&#x27;t always expect the best from others. It might sound cruel, but that&#x27;s normal.<br>
<strong>Yoshizumi:</strong> Don&#x27;t put so much pressure on yourself. If you want to be an onee-chan to her, then you should enjoy yourself while you&#x27;re doing it.<br>
<strong>Yoshizumi:</strong> I don&#x27;t know what goes through her head, but Mihono... I know that, right now, being by your side makes her very happy.<br>
<strong>Yoshizumi:</strong> So you should be happier about it too!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Grandpa...  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="3-the-secret-behind-the-ribbon"></a>3: The Secret Behind the Ribbon<a class="hash-link" href="#3-the-secret-behind-the-ribbon" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> By the way, I&#x27;ve been thinking this for a while, but that ribbon of yours is so fashionable, Setouchi-san.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> The one I tie my hair back with?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Yes, it&#x27;s very stylish. I couldn&#x27;t help but notice it.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> As it turns out, Mihono-chan gave this to me.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Asakura-san did?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Yes. It was a gift from Mihono-chan, when we were split up after I moved away from Gifu to Okayama.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Really? That&#x27;s so cute; giving a ribbon as a parting gift. I wonder what feelings she wanted you to carry with it?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Fufu. Actually, this ribbon was cut in two. Mihono-chan kept the other half. She wanted it to feel like, even if we were apart, we&#x27;d always be together.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> That&#x27;s what she promised me, but...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Oh! You two! More aradama showed up! Let&#x27;s get in formation!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka/Chie:</strong> !!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> ...That seems like the last of them.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Y-Yes. I hope so. So, about what you were saying before... Do you think Mihono-san still remembers that ribbon?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> I&#x27;m not sure? It wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if she forgot.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Eh? What&#x27;s up? You&#x27;re talking about Chii-nee&#x27;s ribbon? Sure I remember!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> !?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Huh? Well of course I would; it&#x27;s really important to me. I tied it to my bed back at the dorms, like a protection charm.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> We suddenly got pulled into this investigation team though, so I didn&#x27;t have a chance to bring it with me.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Wait, you mean you didn&#x27;t see it when you were in my room, Chii-nee?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> O-Oh, I, uh... Sorry, I must not have noticed~. Maybe I was just distracted by how cute your sleeping face looked, Mihono-chan?  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="4-sing-my-fellow-toji"></a>4: Sing!

<strong>Chie:</strong> It&#x27;s not really a tournament, you know.<br>
<strong>Sasano Miyako:</strong> And some of us do have better things to do.<br>
<strong>Miyako:</strong> Still, I didn&#x27;t think the school had a karaoke room. What is this place?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> They use this for school festivals. They let us rent out the latest equipment too.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> This sounds like fun. We haven&#x27;t done anything like karaoke since we formed the investigation team.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...Tch.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Fukki&#x27;s not getting into it... I wish Mirja-san could have joined us too.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Being the captain keeps her busy. Um, here, you&#x27;re up first, Hono-chan.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I&#x27;m on it!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Everyone&#x27;s such good singers~. Miyako-san knows so many western songs, Kiyoka did all those trendy songs, and Fukki... Well, you just kept singing the same one over and over again. Four whole times.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> It&#x27;s the only one I know! You got a problem with that!?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That only leaves Chie-san. From the start, all she&#x27;s been doing is picking out songs for Hono-chan. Does she not plan on singing?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah... You&#x27;re right... I didn&#x27;t get to choose a single song! Everyone else did it, so you sing too, Chii-nee!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Eh? Well, I&#x27;m... You know?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Chie-san, I want to hear you sing too! Please sing for us!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Really? Well, if you&#x27;re all asking...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Come to think of it, I&#x27;ve got no clue what kind of music Chii-nee is into...<br>
<strong>Miyako:</strong> Well, you&#x27;ll find out soon enough. A pro like her&#x27;s about to put us all to shame.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> A pro!? Is she going to sing a really adult love song or something?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Or maybe she&#x27;ll sing jazz!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Or something unexpected, like death metal... Ah... Chie-san took out her smart phone.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> She must already have a karaoke app. She seems really used to this.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...!? This prelude!<br>

<strong>Chie:</strong> Mmhm, you&#x27;re so strong, Kiyoka-chan. But I feel so safe with Mihono-chan watching over me. It&#x27;s like you don&#x27;t need my support anymore.<br>

<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Is that what they call childbearing hips? What&#x27;d you eat to get it that fat, Shirie? 	[Much like chichi means tits, shiri means ass]<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Kofuki-chan!!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> What&#x27;re you getting mad for!? I was just making a simple observation!!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> This is one of those things you should keep to yourself!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> I can&#x27;t believe you. Can we please have a good time here without you saying things like that?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> I&#x27;m having plenty of a good time though.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Anyway, you should try taking it easy, Chichie. Since we came to the pool and all.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> You&#x27;ve been having a hard time, right?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Kofuki-chan... Thank you.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> I didn&#x27;t think you would be so concerned about me...<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Yeah, yeah, dragging that fat ass around must be a lot of work.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> ...Oh. Fufu, so that&#x27;s what you meant, hmm?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> And here your onee-san was proud of you for a moment.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Oh shit, she&#x27;s seriously pissed! I&#x27;m outta here!!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Ah, hold it right there!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Honestly, she&#x27;s so quick to run away...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> ...Does it really look that fat?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Good grief, all this anger&#x27;s left me feeling worn out. I&#x27;ll rest a little.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> That was close... If she&#x27;d have caught me, I&#x27;d get a whole lecture.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> I&#x27;m not about to stand around while she chews me out in this place.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> And I mean, her ass is fat.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Ah... I got it...!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Heheh!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> There we go.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> ...Hmm? I felt something strange at my waist...  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="swimsuit-19-end-dont-make-others-angry"></a>[Swimsuit 19: End]: Don&#x27;t Make Others Angry<a class="hash-link" href="#swimsuit-19-end-dont-make-others-angry" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Crap, she noticed!<br>

<strong>Chie:</strong> ...Is there anything else you&#x27;d like to say?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Your ass is just as fat as I thought!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> That&#x27;s more like you. They&#x27;ll make fitting last words.<br>

<strong>Chie:</strong> Kofuki-chan? I hope you&#x27;re prepared for this.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Wha-, hang on! It&#x27;s just a cute little prank, right!?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Besides, it&#x27;s not like you aren&#x27;t wearing anything under the pareo, so you don&#x27;t have to freak out even if it comes off!<br>

<strong>Kofuki:</strong> So where were you keeping it!?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Oi... C-Cut it out!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> GYAA----!!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Really now, isn&#x27;t it time you learned there are some lines even friends don&#x27;t cross? It&#x27;s important to know right from wrong, Kofuki-chan.<br>

<strong>Chie:</strong> ...Sigh.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Setouchi Chie&#x27;s usual spirit is gone... Was it that much of a shock to her?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Guess even Chichie can get all depressed like that.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It&#x27;s worrying... Hono-chan, have you ever seen Chie-san like that before?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Kind of. Way back when, Chii-nee used to cry really easy, and she&#x27;d get called crybaby Chii-chan.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka/Kofuki:</strong> Crybaby Chii-chan!?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Just now, I heard the word &quot;crybaby&quot;... Mihono-chan?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> H-Huh? Was that something I wasn&#x27;t supposed to tell anyone?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Yo! Crybaby Chii-chan!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> ...Don&#x27;t you think you&#x27;re getting ahead of yourself?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Yeah, yeah, that&#x27;s how it should be. Chichie&#x27;s gotta be mad if anything.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> I can&#x27;t believe you. I&#x27;m feeling fine now, so, this whole... crybaby, thing, just forget about it! Understand?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> But, still... That ribbon is important to you, isn&#x27;t it? It&#x27;s you and Hono-chan&#x27;s...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> That&#x27;s right, it&#x27;s very important to me. But... I can&#x27;t stay moping around about it forever, can I?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Then... Let us give you a ribbon, as a present! To thank you for always looking after us!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> But, I do have other ribbons too... Sorry.<br>

I think it would look good on you...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> I do think it&#x27;s fine, but... Don&#x27;t you think it&#x27;s a little too cute for me?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> How about this one then? This one&#x27;s not cute, which is perfect for you.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> I&#x27;m not sure I like that last part, but... This is nice too. Though, don&#x27;t you think it&#x27;s too flashy?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> You think? This&#x27;s pretty normal.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I think both of them would suit you fine.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Um... I suppose that&#x27;s fine then, but...<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> If you&#x27;ve got something you&#x27;re looking for, then just say it. We can look for one of those.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> It&#x27;s not exactly something I&#x27;m looking for, but... I&#x27;m so used to wearing my usual ribbon that it&#x27;s embarrassing trying something else...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> But that&#x27;s such a waste! Since we&#x27;re here, let&#x27;s try to get you a new ribbon!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> F-Fine then. I&#x27;ll... give it a try.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Still, I wish we had a few more people here to come up with something.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> There&#x27;s no helping it. Hono-chan had something she had to take care of, and the others are all away on missions.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Well, no use talking about who&#x27;s not here, I guess. The two of us&#x27;ll have to come up with something that&#x27;ll fit Chichie.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Thank you for coming out with me today, you two.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> But... I&#x27;m sorry. In the end, I wound up choosing a ribbon with a design like the one I already had.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Don&#x27;t worry about that! It was fun picking out a ribbon with you, Chie-san!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> I mean, if you say that&#x27;s what you want, then it&#x27;s fine, right?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> That&#x27;s what you&#x27;re most used to, after all.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Thank you... I&#x27;ll take good care of it.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Oh? Who could be stopping by this late?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Good, you&#x27;re still up, Chii-nee!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Mihono-chan? Why are you here? I thought you had gone back home today...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah, I just got back. So anyway-- Here, I got you a present!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> ...A ribbon? Don&#x27;t tell me... When you said you had something to take care of today, you were fixing this...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah, no, that&#x27;s not it. Actually, when I first got this ribbon, it came in a set of two.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> ...It did?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> When you look that surprised about it, it&#x27;s kinda awkward.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> And anyway, think about it. If you were going to split the same ribbon between two people, wouldn&#x27;t you normally just buy two of the same ribbon?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> That&#x27;s... true, I suppose. But, if you had this, then... Why did we split one ribbon in two back then?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I thought, if we did it that way, then you wouldn&#x27;t forget about me.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> ...Of all things. Even if you hadn&#x27;t done that, you know I could never forget about you.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> So then, you went back home to get this?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah. I&#x27;d totally forgotten where I&#x27;d left it, so it took me all this time to find.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> But... Chii-nee. This one&#x27;s also the real ribbon from back then.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Will you take it?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> ...Thank you, Mihono-chan.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> The ribbon I got from the others... And this ribbon too, and the torn ribbon as well...

<strong>Kazari:</strong> Ah, that sounds like it could be the reason why.<br>
<strong>Kazari:</strong> What should we do next? There were other places I wanted to go see, but it&#x27;s probably going to get dark soon.<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> Still, isn&#x27;t it a little early to be heading back?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> That&#x27;s right, in that case, why don&#x27;t we go get something sweet to eat? There&#x27;s a place I want to visit.<br>

<strong>Chie:</strong> The mochi was just the right size too, so it felt fine eating before dinner.<br>
<strong>Kazari:</strong> The cream anmitsu was delicious too. If only Misaka-san and everyone were here to taste it.<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> Right-? I get the feeling they&#x27;ve been working a little too hard.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> That&#x27;s true. Let&#x27;s buy something to bring back as a present for them.<br>
<strong>Kazari:</strong> Sure! Setouchi-san, thank you very much for taking us sightseeing around Kamakura today.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> You&#x27;re very welcome. I&#x27;d never taken a good look at the sights here myself, so it was fun.<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> On top of that, you treated us to oden at that shop just now. Thanks a lot!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Fufu, it was nothing. Don&#x27;t mention it.<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> The croquettes we tried on the way were tasty too; I&#x27;m really glad you came with us, Setouchi-san!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Sanae-chan is the one who told me, if you&#x27;re going into Kamakura, you have to stop by that croquette shop.<br>
<strong>Kazari:</strong> I see. So that was one of Iwakura-san&#x27;s picks.<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> We&#x27;ll have to tell her thanks later then. Anyway, to finish off our sightseeing, let&#x27;s pick out some souvenirs!<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> What would be good-? It&#x27;s gotta be something for everyone to eat, right? Since there&#x27;s a lot of people, we should buy a variety of stuff.<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> It would&#x27;ve been great if we had gotten some of that shiruko from before as a present.<br>
<strong>Kazari:</strong> I want to get some Kamakura Great Buddha candy and something else. Come to think of it, we&#x27;ve been eating different things all day, haven&#x27;t we?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Isn&#x27;t that fine? Savoring tasty foods is one of the goals of sightseeing.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> But the shops might be closing up for the day soon, so we should hurry.<br>

<strong>Chie:</strong> No, it&#x27;s only just in the courtyard there. There were some pretty flowers in bloom, so I wanted to stop by.<br>

<strong>Ruiko:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> I was wondering what you needed our help with, but we&#x27;re making a wreath of flowers for some reason!?<br>
<strong>Kazari:</strong> Don&#x27;t fool around, Saten-san. Let&#x27;s make this properly.<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> You say that, but-. It&#x27;s pretty hard working with flowers.<br>
<strong>Kazari:</strong> You&#x27;re great with sewing, so if you just do it carefully, you should be fine.<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> Fine, I&#x27;ll get a little serious I guess-.<br>
<strong>Kazari:</strong> Ah, Setouchi-san. What do you think of using this next?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Oh, that would be great. This is turning into a fine flower wreath with all the nice ones you&#x27;re picking out, Uiharu-san.<br>
<strong>Kazari:</strong> Do you think so? I&#x27;m just choosing the ones that catch my eye.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> I really like this wreath we&#x27;ve made together.<br>
<strong>Kazari:</strong> Ehehe... I&#x27;m happy to hear you think that.<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> Still, why are we making a wreath of flowers all of a sudden?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Uiharu-san&#x27;s wreath is so adorable that I sort of felt like making one.<br>
<strong>Kazari:</strong> ...?<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> Ah-, so that&#x27;s what this is about.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> And, I thought I&#x27;d give this wreath as a gift. The one we&#x27;re making now, I think it would look perfect on you, Uiharu-san. The color combination, and the types of flowers we used.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> I&#x27;d be happy if you&#x27;re happy with that.<br>

<strong>Chie:</strong> Hmm, are they? Let me have a taste... Mm, this sauce is perfect.<br>
<strong>Keiko:</strong> I&#x27;m glad you&#x27;re happy with it.<br>

<strong>Chie:</strong> ...Mm-mm, I didn&#x27;t do anything special.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> And besides, if you hadn&#x27;t been there, Hashi-san, I think we would have been in more trouble, like with setting up the stage.<br>

<strong>Chie:</strong> That&#x27;s right. It&#x27;s part of a lecture I took that sounded interesting. Which is why I won&#x27;t be there for the investigation team on the day of the exercise.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I understand.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Everyone&#x27;s shown considerable growth lately. Even not having you with us, there shouldn&#x27;t be any problems.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> ...I&#x27;m glad to hear it.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> (That gives me some relief, but... it makes me a little lonely too.)<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> What is it you&#x27;ll be doing for a practical exercise in a medical course?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> It looks like we&#x27;ll be acting as nurses.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Are you serious!?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ah, I wanna see. I wanna see it so bad. Chie-san as a nurse; she&#x27;d be a real angel in white!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Huh? Like Chichie could ever cut it as an angel.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> She&#x27;s more like a demon! A demon in white!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> You&#x27;ve never seen Chichie get pissed for real before. You can totally see horns and everything.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Fufu, Kofuki-chan? Don&#x27;t you think that might be the fault of the one making me upset?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> See, look at her! She&#x27;s freaky as hell, right!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Kofuki-chan? Get on your knees.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Look, that&#x27;s what you get for making Chie-san angry.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Yui-chan&#x27;s completely right, Kofuki-san.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Forgetting about Kofuki-san, we all think you&#x27;d look great in it. Chie-san in her nurse cosplay!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Cosplay?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Yeah, Mihono-chan!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Must be so nice, Chie-san in nurse cosplay! I want her to nurse me gently inside and out!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Yui-chan?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Yes, Chie-san!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> On your knees.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Why me too!?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Honestly now.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Mirja, I&#x27;m sure it won&#x27;t be easy on you, but do your best looking after them.<br>

I&#x27;m glad to be working with you today.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> And I am too, Hamatsuka-san. I&#x27;m Setouchi Chie.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> It&#x27;s nice to meet you... Though, this isn&#x27;t the first time we&#x27;ve met, is it?<br>
<strong>Sakura:</strong> Yes. I&#x27;ve seen you sometimes, at Ban-san&#x27;s lab.<br>
<strong>Sakura:</strong> Though, this is the first time we&#x27;ve had an actual conversation.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> That&#x27;s right.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> As soon as you&#x27;re done treating us, you always leave right away, Hamatsuka-san.<br>
<strong>Sakura:</strong> ...I&#x27;m sorry.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Fufu, it&#x27;s not anything you need to apologize for.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Though, I&#x27;ve always thought that I wanted to talk with you, so I&#x27;m glad.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> No matter how small the injury, you always treat it with care, don&#x27;t you, Hamatsuka-san? So I was curious what sort of girl you were.<br>
<strong>Sakura:</strong> But, I&#x27;m not that...<br>
<strong>Nurse:</strong> We&#x27;re going to be starting the practical exercise soon. Please gather around-.<br>
<strong>Sakura:</strong> Ah, the exercise is starting. We should go.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> ...She ran away. Did I do something to make her not like me?<br>
<strong>Patient A:</strong> Thank you very much.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Not at all; please take care of yourself.<br>
<strong>Patient B:</strong> Excuse me, I&#x27;d like to ask something...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Yes, what do you need?<br>
<strong>Sakura:</strong> (...She&#x27;s amazing. So many people are just going over to Setouchi-san...)<br>
<strong>Sakura:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Good work, Hamatsuka-san. That was nerve-wracking, with how unfamiliar I was with everything.<br>
<strong>Sakura:</strong> You didn&#x27;t seem that way at all. Um...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> What is it?<br>
<strong>Sakura:</strong> There&#x27;s something I&#x27;m having trouble with...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Mmhm?<br>
<strong>Sakura:</strong> ...No, I shouldn&#x27;t be asking you after all. I can&#x27;t go into much detail about it...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> (Was what&#x27;s bothering her the reason she avoided me before?)<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> ...You said you&#x27;re having trouble with something, but, do you know exactly what it is?<br>
<strong>Sakura:</strong> ...I do.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> (If I had to guess... She&#x27;s avoiding getting involved with other people? But, she&#x27;s trying to talk about it with me...)<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> You&#x27;ll be alright.<br>
<strong>Sakura:</strong> Eh?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> You&#x27;re a kind and earnest girl, Hamatsuka-san. So long as you know what&#x27;s causing it, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll get through it someday.<br>
<strong>Sakura:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Sakura:</strong> Thank you very much. That makes me feel a little better.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> No, I&#x27;m the one who should be thanking you.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> After all, without people like you there for us, us toji wouldn&#x27;t be able to keep on fighting.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> So... we&#x27;ll keep being in your care in the future.<br>

<strong>Chie:</strong> Fufu, we got plenty, so have as many as you like.<br>
<strong>Miki:</strong> Will do-!<br>
<strong>Miki:</strong> Why do you think potatoes are so tasty? They&#x27;re all warm and sweet and... I&#x27;ll take another!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Sure, here you go.<br>
<strong>Miki:</strong> I bet I could keep eating these all night!<br>
<strong>Miki:</strong> Another one!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Here.<br>
<strong>Miki:</strong> One more!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Here you g... Ah. Sorry, Miki-san.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> That was the last one just now... Looks like I didn&#x27;t get enough. Should I go buy you one more?<br>
<strong>Miki:</strong> You will!?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> You looked so happy eating them. I was having fun just watching you go.<br>
<strong>Miki:</strong> Thanks so much, Chie!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> But, we&#x27;re out here to find a biribiri plasma rod, so we have to make sure not to forget, okay?<br>
<strong>Miki:</strong> Sure we won&#x27;t!<br>
<strong>Miki:</strong> Aradama&#x27;ll go down like nothing with all this potato power!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Oh, but it looks like the baked potato stand moved somewhere else.<br>
<strong>Miki:</strong> That just means we can look for them again while we look for the aradama.<br>
<strong>Miki:</strong> That way it&#x27;s two birds with one stone.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> That&#x27;s true; let&#x27;s do that then.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Oh?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> It looks like we found the aradama before the baked potatoes. Let&#x27;s go take care of them, Miki-san.<br>

<strong>Chie:</strong> Eh?<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> I actually came to get souvenirs for the people who&#x27;ve helped me too.<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> But, picking out souvenirs is very inefficient.<br>
