class="hash-link" href="#1-dreaming-kofuki-chan" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>--Progress report from research lab 8, in charge of subject Shichinosato Kofuki. Recorded by Ban Tsugumi.</p><p>Today, at 13:00, Shichinosato Kofuki entered the research lab. I was running late from a lesson, and when I entered the labroom I could tell something was amiss.<br>
From what I gathered from my colleagues, for an unexplained reason, Shichinosato Kofuki was in an unusually rough mood. I wasn&#x27;t quite sure how to approach the situation.</p><p>My colleagues made such comments as &quot;When grins like that, I feel like I&#x27;ll be her next victim&quot;, and &quot;If the higher-ups find out, we&#x27;ll be in trouble&quot;, and &quot;We&#x27;re going to die&quot;.</p><p>But, as far as I could see, the subject wasn&#x27;t behaving any different than usual.</p><p>Because of this, and because I am the one who has made the most direct contact with Shichinosato Kofuki, my colleagues requested that I attempt to pacify her.</p><p><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Now then, Shichinosato-san, today we have six A- grade aradama for processing from lab 4. Each specimen has particular characteristics involving the surface composition of their bodies.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> They&#x27;ve asked us to experiment with the angle you cut through them with your okatana, so please look over the order sheet for the specifics. After that, let&#x27;s get to it!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...Sure.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Good work. By the way, you seem to be in an unusually good mood today... Did something nice happen?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Yeah! I had a good dream!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> A dream? That sounds nice. Were you on a date with the one you like or something?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Huh? Don&#x27;t talk stupid. A good dream&#x27;s more like... C&#x27;mon, you know what I mean!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Like where I get to slaughter lots of aradama-chan, of course!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Of course it was-. But I knew that already-.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> I was downtown... And it was like the world was covered in aradama. I&#x27;d cut one and keep cutting &#x27;em and they&#x27;d just keep popping out; every time one of them died two more would take its place! More and more and more!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> It was too good! I got to kill as many as I wanted! Just me and aradama-chan!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Ahhh, man! I can&#x27;t take it anymore! You know what I mean, right!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> No, you lost me right away.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> But I&#x27;m relieved to see you&#x27;re your usual self. Since you&#x27;re in a good mood, why not keep up this pace? Seize the day, right!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> You know it!<br>
--Progress report from research lab 8, in charge of subject Shichinosato Kofuki. Recorded by Ban Tsugumi.</p><p>Today, Shichinosato Kofuki was in high spirits. When the subject was asked why, the reason given was that she had seen a very good dream.</p><p>As far as the details of the dream go, I see nothing of concern. They diverge greatly from what would be considered normal for a girl her age, but it was exceedingly typical for her disposition.</p><p>In addition, from now on, I would like to review all reports being made on subject Shichinosato Kofuki before they are submitted.</p><p>That is all.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="2-no-matter-what-i-love-aradama"></a>2: No Matter What, I Love Aradama!<a class="hash-link" href="#2-no-matter-what-i-love-aradama" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>In April--</p><p><strong>Voice:</strong> Why not study Kurama-ryu! Founded by the famous Minamoto no Yoshitsune-! Sounds cool, doesn&#x27;t it! Come on over and change your image!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Tch! It&#x27;s that time again when everyone&#x27;s out recruiting the new students...<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Year after year, they&#x27;re annoying as hell. I&#x27;ve gotta get to the research building.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Just wanna play with aradama-chan already...<br>
<strong>???:</strong> H-Hey, you!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Huh?<br>
<strong>Tamaki Marie:</strong> I-I&#x27;m Tamaki Marie, a toji in the first year of the high school branch.ã€€If you haven&#x27;t decided on a research discipline yet, feel free to join me in learning Hokushin Itto-ryu...<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Get lost...<br>
<strong>Marie:</strong> Huh!?<br>
<strong>Watanuki Kazumi:</strong> You there, you&#x27;re a new student in the middle school branch, aren&#x27;t you? How would you like to learn the ways of Satsuma Jigen-ryu?<br>
<strong>Kazumi:</strong> It requires much more dedication to training than any other style, but no other sword will be able to match your gallantry...<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...I&#x27;m a third year.<br>
<strong>Nagasaki Sumi:</strong> U-Um...<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Seriously? Another one of you?<br>
<strong>Sumi:</strong> Y-You&#x27;re a first year too, aren&#x27;t you? I just joined here, and I&#x27;m having trouble finding the dojo, so...<br>
<strong>Sumi:</strong> Please, could we go there together?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Sumi:</strong> Also, I haven&#x27;t made any friends yet, so... Ah, and if you like, do you want to learn Jiken Shinkage-ryu together...<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Get it through your head already! I&#x27;m a third year!<br>
<strong>Sumi:</strong> Y-You&#x27;re my senpai!? S-S-S-Sorry!<br>
<strong>???:</strong> Kofukicchi~!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Go to hell! I said I&#x27;m a third yea... Oh, it&#x27;s you.<br>
<strong>Fujimaki Minaki:</strong> Hm~, what&#x27;s wrong?<br>
<strong>Minaki:</strong> !<br>
<strong>Minaki:</strong> Ohh! I bet you got mistaken for a first year again, cause you&#x27;re so tiny! Poor little Kofukicchi!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> And it just keeps coming.<br>
<strong>Minaki:</strong> Good job pulling through~. Here, I brought some milk for you.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Ooh, I&#x27;ll take it. Thanks.............. (Gulp)<br>
<strong>Minaki:</strong> Mmmm, you&#x27;re so small and cute, Kofukkichi~. (Rub rub)<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...You&#x27;re as bad as the rest!<br>
Inside the research building of Renpu Girls&#x27; School, in the aradama processing facility--</p><p><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Where&#x27;s the next one! Why&#x27;s the next aradama-chan not in here yet!?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> What&#x27;s the matter? You&#x27;re in a bad temper today.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Shut up! Fuck! Everyone keeps treating me like a little kid! Aradama-chan&#x27;s the only one who gets what I want!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Ahhh, damnit! I love you! Aradama-chan!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="3-punkish-girl"></a>3: Punkish Girl<a class="hash-link" href="#3-punkish-girl" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Kofuki-san! Kofuki-san!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Tch, the sun&#x27;s barely up and you&#x27;re already bugging me. What do you want?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> S-Sorry. It&#x27;s just... There&#x27;s something I wanted to ask you...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Earlier, Hono-chan and I were talking about what kind of normal clothes everyone wears. So, Kofuki-san, what do you wear when you&#x27;re not in your uniform?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Ahh...ã€€Then bring me one of those fashion books you&#x27;ve always got piled up on your desk.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> I just pick out whatever though, so don&#x27;t expect much... Let&#x27;s see.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Hm? What&#x27;s up? Ah! You asked about Fukki&#x27;s fashion? I&#x27;m so curious!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I know, right?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Uhh... The stuff I wear is like... This, and this...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> So it really is like the hoodie you usually wear.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Stuff like this too...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> A biker jacket too...? I didn&#x27;t peg you for it, but I guess you&#x27;re the cool type?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It seems like it. With that matching undershirt, it&#x27;d look really good... These are all clothes I could never wear though...<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Oh! These short pants look good... Geh, these are way too expensive though...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Hono-chan, Kofuki-san&#x27;s fashion level is actually really high...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Yep. She&#x27;s really fashion-conscious...<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...And I guess that&#x27;s it.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I get it now. Kofuki-san&#x27;s style is boyish and punk fashion. Where do you usually do your shopping?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Huh? I just buy something if it catches my eye while I&#x27;m out. Don&#x27;t have any favorite shops or anything. So wait, this stuff is called punk?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Y-You didn&#x27;t know that!?<br>
Another day...</p><p><strong>Chie:</strong> Kofuki-chan, let&#x27;s go shopping in town together. Everyone&#x27;s picking out clothing today.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Huhh? Go do it yourselves!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Well, you see...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> C&#x27;mon, Fukki! Come pick out some clothes for me!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Yes! I want to pick up some of your fashion sense, Kofuki-san!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> ...That&#x27;s how it is.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Ahh...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> So then, are you coming?<br>

Oi, Mihocchi.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ehh, what&#x27;s wrong with that, Fukki? We all finally agreed to go out and eat together, and now you&#x27;re acting all stubborn about it.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Look... In the end, food&#x27;s just...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Oh, I know.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> &quot;Oi, Mihocchi. Food&#x27;s all the same after it&#x27;s in your stomach. Doesn&#x27;t matter what it&#x27;s like going in. If I don&#x27;t get to kill some aradama, then I don&#x27;t give a crap about whatever you wanna do.&quot;<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...You were gonna say something like that, right?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Just come eat with us! The ice cream here is super tasty, you know?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> She&#x27;s right. Come on, Kofuki-chan, pick a flavor!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Tch!<br>
<strong>Employee:</strong> If you&#x27;re not sure, we&#x27;ll let you do a taste test! I recommend our limited time &quot;Cherry &amp; Vanilla Blend&quot;! Try some!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> O-Okay...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Fukki... I don&#x27;t care how much you liked it, you&#x27;re not going to be able to eat all that...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I mean, they actually filled a whole bucket for you. I don&#x27;t think those are meant for just one person?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...Back off! You can&#x27;t have any!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Fufu, but just look how happy she is. Let&#x27;s just let her enjoy it~.<br>
--Half a month later.</p><p><strong>Chie:</strong> Kofuki-chan! We&#x27;re all going for ice cream again. Are you coming...<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> I don&#x27;t want any...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> But you&#x27;ve been so into it lately? Every day you get one of those buckets tucked in your arms while you eat it all.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Leave me alone... I said I don&#x27;t want any more ice cream!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Are you sure...?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah, Chii-nee! Apparently, Fukki binges on eating something and then gets sick of it.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> I never wanna see ice cream again...  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="5-cut-it-out-already"></a>5: Cut it out Already!<a class="hash-link" href="#5-cut-it-out-already" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> Good teamwork, everyone! Ah, Mirja-san! Can you please do some maintenance on Kiyomitsu for me!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Asakura Mihono, I&#x27;ll teach you the proper way to handle it yourself, so please try to remember. More importantly...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> When we pushed back the aradama without much effort, I was very surprised to see Shichinosato Kofuki obey orders and hang back without giving chase... She&#x27;s changed, hasn&#x27;t she?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> She has. It also feels like it&#x27;s easier to talk to her lately. It&#x27;s all thanks to Setouchi-san, I think.<br>
<em>Kofuki kicks a tree</em></p><p><strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...Damnit... I&#x27;m getting really pissed off! It&#x27;s all Chichie&#x27;s fault!<br>

<strong>Kofuki:</strong> I mean...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> &quot;That&#x27;s enough! Please...! You have to take better care of yourself!&quot;<br>

Is it really true that Renpu Girls&#x27; Academy is researching human aradamas behind closed doors!?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> The hell are you talking about?<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> It&#x27;s a rumor I&#x27;ve been hearing from all the toji!<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> Since I like learning about urban legends, I thought you toji might have some, so I asked a bunch of people!<br>
<strong>Kazari:</strong> I&#x27;m sorry about her, Shichinosato-san.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Then, why&#x27;d you decide to ask me about this? I don&#x27;t really care about rumors and whatever, y&#x27;know?<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> Even if you aren&#x27;t interested, you&#x27;re still a toji at Renpu Girls&#x27; Academy, right? And also, I&#x27;ve heard you hang around the research labs a lot.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Well, you&#x27;re not wrong, but still, human aradama...<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> It&#x27;s exciting!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Like I&#x27;d know anything.<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> What, so it was only a rumor after all-?<br>
<strong>Kazari:</strong> See, that&#x27;s what I was telling you. There&#x27;s no way that kind of thing would be real!<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> You say that, but, if it really was real, wouldn&#x27;t you be interested, Uiharu?<br>
<strong>Kazari:</strong> In that case... I think I would, a little...<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Then, wanna go see the research labs? I was just about to head over there actually.<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> Can we!?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Sure, do whatever you want. Though, whatever happens when you get there, it&#x27;s not my problem.<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> W-Whatever happens...? Then, are there really human aradama!?<br>
<strong>Kazari:</strong> S-Saten-san, maybe we should just give up on this...<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> It sounds interesting! Let&#x27;s go, Uiharu!<br>
<strong>Kazari:</strong> Of course it came to this...<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> ...Gulp. This is the lab from the rumors... Shichinosato-san... Wait, huh? She&#x27;s not here?<br>
<strong>Kazari:</strong> She was right with us until a minute ago... Wh-Where&#x27;d she go?<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> ...Maybe the toilet?<br>
<strong>Kazari:</strong> Do you think?<br>
<strong>???:</strong> Excuse me.<br>
<strong>Ruiko/Kazari:</strong> HYAAAAAAAA!?<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> I&#x27;m sorry, it&#x27;s not like we wandered in here on our own! Shichinosato-san just led us here is all!<br>
<strong>Kazari:</strong> This is why I told you to stop, didn&#x27;t I!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Really now... This was mean of you, Shichinosato-san.<br>
<strong>Ruiko/Kazari:</strong> Huh?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Ahahahahaha! Sorry, sorry.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Honestly... My name is Ban Tsugumi. You wanted to look in on our research, didn&#x27;t you? Make yourselves at home.<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> I-I thought you&#x27;d be mad at us...  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="railgun---kofuki-end-take-it-easy-with-gathering-rumors"></a>[Railgun - Kofuki: End]: Take it Easy With Gathering Rumors<a class="hash-link" href="#railgun---kofuki-end-take-it-easy-with-gathering-rumors" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Ruiko:</strong> When you suddenly popped out at us, I was thinking, &quot;We&#x27;re gonna get turned into human aradama experiments!&quot;<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Human aradama... Ahh, it&#x27;s about that rumor, isn&#x27;t it.<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> You know about it!?<br>
<strong>Kazari:</strong> Saten-san, let&#x27;s stop asking them weird questions.<br>
<strong>Saten:</strong> But, we finally met someone who knows about it!? Aren&#x27;t you curious, Uiharu?<br>
<strong>Kazari:</strong> Well, I am a little bit curious...<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> That rumor is completely made up. We don&#x27;t carry out experiments fusing humans with aradama or the like here.<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> So that&#x27;s all-.<br>
<strong>Kazari:</strong> Then, what kind of research do you do here?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> We gather data on aradama and toji. To put it simply, we have toji fight with aradama, and we collect the resulting data.<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> Kind of like that?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> ORAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Yes, just like that.<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> Is it alright for us to watch on for a while?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> It&#x27;s perfectly fine. Just, hold on...<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Alright, I&#x27;m done!<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> Hey, it looks like she just finished beating the aradama too, so let&#x27;s go!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Ah, please wait a moment!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Uiharu-san, please stop Saten-san! The current turn hasn&#x27;t finished yet!<br>
<strong>Kazari:</strong> Ehh!? S-Saten-san, hang on!<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> Huh?<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> SHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Hey, what&#x27;d you come running in here for!!<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> I-I thought you were finished already!<br>
<strong>Kazari:</strong> Are you okay, Saten-san!?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> You two aren&#x27;t supposed to be in here! Whatever! I&#x27;ll take care of these guys fast, so just hide in the back!<br>
<strong>Ruiko/Kazari:</strong> O-Okay!<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> Th-Thank god we&#x27;re safe...<br>
<strong>Kazari:</strong> This is all because you didn&#x27;t listen to Ban-san finish talking.<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> ...Sorry about that.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Take it easy with chasing these weird rumors, will you.<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> Right, I&#x27;ll be more careful about it from now on!<br>

<strong>Mihono:</strong> !? Just now, that was...<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Yes, that was the shrill scream of Shichinosato-san just now.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Knowing Fukki, an aradama probably didn&#x27;t get the drop on her or something, right?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Yes, it&#x27;s difficult to imagine. I think it&#x27;s safe to say something else must have occurred.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Something that would make Fukki scream like that...?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> That&#x27;s right. ...That aside, &quot;gyaaaaaaa&quot; is just the sort of scream you&#x27;d expect from Shichinosato-san, isn&#x27;t it.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ahaha, you&#x27;re not wrong. Anyway, let&#x27;s go see what happened!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Fukki!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> You two&#x27;re slow. Though, thanks to that, I got to take my sweet time having fun with the aradma-chan.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> This is exactly as predicted so far. So then, what was that scream earlier about?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> What, you heard that?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> When you scream that loud, of course we&#x27;d hear it.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Whoops, sorry. I couldn&#x27;t help myself from shouting. Aghh, just thinking about it pisses me off.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Pisses you off? The aradama?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> You dumbass, Mihocchi! There&#x27;s no way an aradama-chan&#x27;d piss me off!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> What pissed me off was that tree there!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> ...You love aradama, and you hate vegetation. You&#x27;re very irritable.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Shichinosato-san, I&#x27;m slightly concerned for your future.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> I don&#x27;t get what you&#x27;re getting at, but I can tell you&#x27;re making fun of me.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> You seem to be lacking calcium. Would you like a candy?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> I&#x27;ve got milk to drink! And like I&#x27;d eat that shady looking candy anyway!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ahaha! You two sure get along-. So, what happened anyway, Fukki?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> This here!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Your jacket?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Oh? It&#x27;s slightly torn.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah, it is!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> It got caught on that branch.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I see, so that&#x27;s why. Though, it&#x27;s hardly a problem, is it? You have lots of similar jackets you can go back and get.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Doesn&#x27;t matter; what pisses me off pisses me off!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Then, how about next day we have off, we go clothes shopping together?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Clothes shopping? I haven&#x27;t been in a while, so that sounds good.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Nice! You should come too, Tsugumi-san!

<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Yawwn... I&#x27;m tired.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> That&#x27;s because you were asleep on the train. Here, have some of this and you&#x27;ll be wide awake.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Oh-... Thanks...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> BFWOO-!?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Oi, what&#x27;d you feed me!!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Just something simple to eliminate drowsiness.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Don&#x27;t pass me toxic crap like it&#x27;s no big deal! You&#x27;re freaky.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Am I?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Fukki&#x27;s looking wide awake now at least, so let&#x27;s go buy some clothes!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> By the way, how do you pick out your clothes, Fukki?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I remember Kiyoka saying, &quot;Fukki&#x27;s got a great sense of style!&quot;, so I&#x27;ve been curious ever since.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> I just pick out whatever. Cruise around the shops and buy stuff...<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> See, like that? Ohm.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> You say, &quot;like that&quot;, but... Where&#x27;d you find these hoodies?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> They were in the middle of the store, remember? [chew chew]<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I didn&#x27;t see it... Nnn, this kind of thing&#x27;s pretty cute too.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> It looks good on you, Mihocchi. This&#x27;s good.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Thanks, Fukki.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> It&#x27;s somewhat embarrassing the way we all match though, isn&#x27;t it?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> You think so? [chew chew] Mm-!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...That crepe must be yummy, huh.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...[grin] Mihocchi, you want a bite?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Can I?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Sure, but you get one bite, alright? Here... Open wide.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ahh-... Nngh!?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Hey, Fukki! Weren&#x27;t you gonna let me have some!?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Ahahahahaha! If you wanted to eat some, then go buy it yourself, Mihocchi.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Ohm. ...[chew chew] I see, it is fairly good.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Hey, don&#x27;t you go eating it!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Now&#x27;s my chance... Mmm-, so good!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Mihocchi too!? Ahh, damnit! Gimme back the bits you ate!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> How am I supposed to do that when I ate it!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> You could just go buy another one, Shichinosato-san.<br>

<strong>Kofuki:</strong> What, done already?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Yes, this is plenty for today. ...Here, have some hot milk.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> You didn&#x27;t put anything weird in it, right?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Of course not.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Thanks for that... Oww, hot! Let it cool down some first!<br>

<strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...Huh? You even listening? What part about getting your pudding eaten sounds fun to you!<br>

<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> See, isn&#x27;t that what I was telling you?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Don&#x27;t give me that! Nobody&#x27;s gonna come back with &quot;Yeah, it was fun,&quot; after they tell you about how they got their milk pudding stolen!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...And that&#x27;s what she said, but, what do you think?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> This isn&#x27;t the sort of conversation we should have in the middle of a mission, is it.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> It&#x27;s not like we&#x27;re finding any aradama-chan, so just loosen up.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I thought I bought you another milk pudding though...<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> No duh? Like I was gonna let you off eating it like that. But still, what do you think, Mihocchi?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> What do you mean, what do I think...? She said you sounded like you were having fun, right?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> If you&#x27;re having fun, then isn&#x27;t that all good?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Yeah, I guess, but still, it kinda rubs me the wrong way somehow.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I believe that&#x27;s not the point Ban Tsugumi was trying to get across, but that you&#x27;ve changed, Shichinosato Kofuki.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Huh? I haven&#x27;t changed a bit. It&#x27;s not like, back then, I never had fun when I wasn&#x27;t playing with aradama-chan or anything.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I think you&#x27;ve changed a lot though? Like, when we first met, Kiyoka always stayed away from you, but it&#x27;s not like that anymore, right?<br>

<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Did Asakura-san take your milk pudding again... No, you didn&#x27;t get enough sleep, did you.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...How&#x27;d you know that?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> You have bags under your eyes. It would be obvious to anyone.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...Tch, you&#x27;re too damn quick on the uptake.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> So, why weren&#x27;t you getting enough sleep? Were you... No, you don&#x27;t read books, do you?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Don&#x27;t go deciding that on your own!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> And anyway, it&#x27;s all your fault!!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Hm? It&#x27;s... my fault?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Yeah it is. Cause you went and said I looked like I was having fun, it turned into this argument about whether I&#x27;d changed or not, and I felt too messed up to get any sleep.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I&#x27;m having a hard time following, but... After I said you seemed to be enjoying yourself, you spoke to it with the investigation team, and they came to the conclusion that you&#x27;ve changed?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> ...Is that how it happened?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...You got it.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> If you were that worried about something like that, then you really have changed, Shichinosato-san.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> So what... You think I&#x27;ve changed too?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I do.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Of course you would change. Everyone is affected by the people around them.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Even I&#x27;ve changed after becoming involved with the investigation team, wouldn&#x27;t you agree?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> I guess... Actually, did you change? Sorry, I don&#x27;t really remember.<br>

<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> It seems that the old Shichinosato-san really didn&#x27;t think about anything besides aradama.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Well duh, wasn&#x27;t that obvious?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> (On top of that, when everyone around you are people like me... It&#x27;s only natural that it would change you.)<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Though, whether or not you change, you&#x27;ll still be Shichinosato-san.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I don&#x27;t think you need to think so deeply about it.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> You get real annoying when you&#x27;re explaining stuff, y&#x27;know. Like, you&#x27;re probably thinking you can spin me whatever bullshit, but I&#x27;m not letting you outta this one.<br>

<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Good timing.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> You do seem to be having the most fun whenever aradama appear. That part of you really doesn&#x27;t change.<br>

<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Why not; that&#x27;s so lame. Then, lemme tear around town in a cop car!<br>

<strong>Police Officer:</strong> Maybe you&#x27;re right. Actually... I know! Let&#x27;s have you be a crossing guard.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> A crossing what?<br>
<strong>Police Officer:</strong> It&#x27;s to keep the kids going to and home from school safe; you stand at road crossings on the school route and make sure people drive safe.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Huhh!? Why do I gotta do a lame job like that...<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> Isn&#x27;t it be cause you keep saying you want to do dangerous things, like shooting a gun, or racing a carr?<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> ...You get to help the police while they&#x27;re shorthanded and learn the importance of traffic safety; that&#x27;s a great logical place for youu.<br>

<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Nn...? What&#x27;re they doing coming into the intersection!? It&#x27;s red right now.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Shit, they&#x27;re gonna crash into the kids crossing over!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Oi, hold it! STOP THE BIKE, WOULD YA---!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> I said stop, damnit!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Sigh, now you stop. Could you at least look where you&#x27;re going!? And you&#x27;re not allowed to double up on a bike, y&#x27;know!?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> This is a school road, okay!? What&#x27;re you gonna do if you ran over some kid!? How&#x27;re you gonna make up for that!? Huhh!?<br>
<strong>High School Girl 1:</strong> We&#x27;re sorry...<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Don&#x27;t let me catch you ever sharing a bike again! And you better watch the lights next time. Even the freaking elementary schoolers know this stuff!<br>
<strong>High School Girl 2:</strong> Yes ma&#x27;am, we&#x27;ll be careful.<br>
<strong>Elementary Schooler 1:</strong> You did it, police lady!<br>
<strong>Elementary Schooler 2:</strong> It was really cool how you scolded them.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> What, you saw all that?<br>
<strong>Elementary Schooler 1:</strong> Those onee-sans never pay attention to the lights. We tell them, you shouldn&#x27;t do that, but they never listen to us.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Seriously...? They&#x27;re repeat offenders, huh.<br>
<strong>Elementary Schooler 2:</strong> Thank you for scolding them, miss police lady.<br>
<strong>Elementary Schooler 1:</strong> I&#x27;m glad you&#x27;re here. Thank you.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> I-It&#x27;s not anything you&#x27;ve gotta thank me for... Look, the light&#x27;s still green, so look both ways and walk across already.<br>
<strong>Elementary Schooler 1:</strong> Okaaay, see you later, miss police lady!<br>
<strong>Elementary Schooler 2:</strong> Good luck with your work-!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> S-Sure. Thanks.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> (I thought this job&#x27;d be all boring, but maybe it&#x27;s not so bad.)</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations/edit/docs/episodes/Shichinosato_Kofuki_Episodes.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_2_ui" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_3DPF"></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/tnm-translations/docs/episodes/Setouchi_Chie_Episodes/"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Â« Setouchi Chie Episodes</div></a></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/tnm-translations/docs/episodes/Musumi_Kiyoka_Episodes/"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Next</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Musumi Kiyoka Episodes Â»</div></a></div></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_35-E thin-scrollbar"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#1-dreaming-kofuki-chan" class="table-of-contents__link">1: Dreaming Kofuki-chan</a></li><li><a href="#2-no-matter-what-i-love-aradama" class="table-of-contents__link">2: No Matter What, I Love Aradama!</a></li><li><a href="#3-punkish-girl" class="table-of-contents__link">3: Punkish Girl</a></li><li><a href="#4-whats-tasty" class="table-of-contents__link">4: What&#39;s Tasty?</a></li><li><a href="#5-cut-it-out-already" class="table-of-contents__link">5: Cut it out Already!</a></li><li><a href="#railgun---kofuki-start-its-bizarre-the-human-aradama-of-renpu-girls-academy" class="table-of-contents__link">Railgun - Kofuki: Start: It&#39;s Bizarre!
