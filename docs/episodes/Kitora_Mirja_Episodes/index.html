title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Mizushina Kinuka:</strong> By the way, Kitora-san. There&#x27;s been talk about how Nakano-san&#x27;s aradama killcount hasn&#x27;t been going up. What&#x27;s your opinion on that, as her commander in the field?<br>
<strong>Kinuka:</strong> Don&#x27;t you try to provide all the girls in your squad with equal opportunities in battle? So please, tell me what you think.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I don&#x27;t mind, but... Is there really a problem with Nakano Jun? I don&#x27;t believe there are many toji as capable as her.<br>
<strong>Kinuka:</strong> So you feel the same way... But, the big headed types at General Headquarters and the other commanding officers just don&#x27;t get it.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Oh... I see.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Then, the next time we face aradama in battle, I&#x27;ll place Nakano Jun at the center of our formation. Have headquarters monitor us, and ask commanders from other squads to review it as well.<br>
<strong>Kinuka:</strong> Are you sure that will convince them...?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> It would be wrong to get complacent, but I have faith in Nakano Jun. I&#x27;m almost certain I can prove her effectiveness beyond what a more haphazardly organized squad could manage.<br>
On the day of a fight against aradama---</p><p><strong>Mirja:</strong> The plan is just as I&#x27;ve told you! Kitora Squad, spread out!<br>
<strong>Kitora Squad Members:</strong> Understood!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Nakano Jun!<br>
<strong>Jun:</strong> Aye!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> You&#x27;re the key to our strategy today. Use your okatana as freely as you like!<br>
<strong>Jun:</strong> Sure thing; leave it to me.<br>
<strong>Jun:</strong> Would hate to have you all looking down on me. Aradama-han, don&#x27;t think... You&#x27;ll be coming past! Nakano Jun! So easy!<br>
<strong>Commanding Officer of the Special Ritual Squad:</strong> Don&#x27;t tell me... Kitora Mirja! You can&#x27;t expect her to deal with that many aradama by herself!<br>
<strong>Special Ritual Squad Operations Planner:</strong> But look... She&#x27;s managing to hold her own. Actually, she hasn&#x27;t been pushed back a single step...<br>
<strong>Kinuka:</strong> All by herself she managed to draw a line, and any aradama she lets through are easily defeated by the other toji.<br>
<strong>Kinuka:</strong> After all, there&#x27;s no need for her to attack or kill aradama herself. This is the most effective way of using her.<br>
<strong>Commanding Officer of the Special Ritual Squad:</strong> I don&#x27;t believe it!<br>
<strong>Kinuka:</strong> Oh, it seems to be already over.<br>
<strong>Jun:</strong> Last one! Letting it on by!<br>
<strong>Suzumoto Hana:</strong> Taking care of it! Haaa!<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> GYAAAAAAA!<br>
<strong>Kinuka:</strong> Fufu, would you look at that~. That&#x27;s the result of thinking your tactics and strategies through~.<br>
<strong>Uraga Nao:</strong> Do you really think it&#x27;s that easy? Most couldn&#x27;t manage it. Something like that requires a lot of trust between everyone to work.<br>
<strong>Nao:</strong> I know I wouldn&#x27;t be able to support a lone guard like that. Frankly, I think Mirja&#x27;s the only one who could pull off such a risky strategy.<br>
<strong>Kinuka:</strong> Well, what&#x27;s wrong with that! She&#x27;s in Kitora Squad, after all!<br>
<strong>Kinuka:</strong> So long as she&#x27;s there, Nakano-san can be used to her fullest potential! Am I wrong?<br>
<strong>Nao:</strong> ...Hey, Mizushina-san?<br>
<strong>Kinuka:</strong> Ah, Nao-san, you&#x27;re still in work mode, I see~.<br>
<strong>Nao:</strong> Why do you... You keep sending unorthodox girls for Mirja to work with... What&#x27;s your goal here?<br>
<strong>Kinuka:</strong> Fufu, you know me~. It&#x27;s all for my cute little sister&#x27;s sake, of course!<br>
<strong>Kinuka:</strong> I want Mirja&#x27;s squad to get even stronger. To turn them into the safest and most capable place for my sister to join. That&#x27;s my secret plan!<br>
<strong>Kinuka:</strong> Anyway, I&#x27;m done for the day~.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="2-what-makes-up-mirja"></a>2: What Makes Up Mirja<a class="hash-link" href="#2-what-makes-up-mirja" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>???:</strong> Kitora Mirja-senpai!<br>
<strong>Tomomu Niwa:</strong> Thank goodness I caught up to you! You forgot your phone in the briefing room!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Ahh, I must have. Thank you, you&#x27;ve really helped me out.<br>
<strong>Niwa:</strong> And, um... I&#x27;m sorry! To see whose phone it was, I took a look at your background photo.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I don&#x27;t mind. You don&#x27;t have to worry about it.<br>
<strong>Niwa:</strong> Ah, okay~! Um, there&#x27;s something else I wanted to ask... Are the other people in the photo your family?<br>
<strong>Niwa:</strong> The one with the same hair color as you looked like your dad, and your mom seemed very pretty... And is that your grandpa by the furnace? He looks like a blacksmith!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Yes, my grandfather makes a living in Kyoto as a swordsmith. My father is from Finland, however... He admired Japanese swords so much that he came here to study under my grandfather as his apprentice.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> A lot of things happened and he became married to my mother, and those are my circumstances... You could say.<br>
<strong>Niwa:</strong> A Japanese sword family... I had no idea! Ahh! That&#x27;s why you have the skills of a sword polisher, isn&#x27;t it, Mirja-senpai? Does that mean... Did you want to specialize in that?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> That was what I had planned on doing, however...<br>
<strong>Niwa:</strong> I don&#x27;t believe it! Mirja-senpai&#x27;s a sword polisher just like me! That&#x27;s so cool!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Now I&#x27;m retired from it. Though, my Jikkyuu Mitsutada was an Akabane sword I went through the process of restoring...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> When Mitsutada found me suitable, I saw the path of a toji open before me. Thanks to that, I am now simply a toji.<br>
<strong>Niwa:</strong> Hmm, Mirja-senpai, are you trying to convince yourself you don&#x27;t regret leaving it behind?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> What do you mean?<br>
<strong>Niwa:</strong> No, I understand. Let&#x27;s see... When I was in elementary school, I went on a field trip to Ooyamatsumi Shrine.<br>
<strong>Niwa:</strong> Ah, sorry to suddenly launch into a story about myself, but please listen. At the shrine, they had collected lots of rusted okatana.<br>
<strong>Niwa:</strong> At the time, I thought they could really use more help restoring those. On display in the corner, they had dozens of them lined up. Wouldn&#x27;t that make you want to restore them to their former glory, Mirja-senpai?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> It would, but...<br>
<strong>Niwa:</strong> See! It really gets your sword polisher blood boiling, doesn&#x27;t it? You can feel it too!<br>
<strong>Niwa:</strong> You&#x27;d feel like you have to polish those swords! After all, Mirja-senpai, I know you always carry a polishing toolkit with you wherever you go!<br>
<strong>Niwa:</strong> Once you feel that compulsion with fixing up swords, it never leaves you!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I&#x27;m not so sure...<br>
<strong>Niwa:</strong> Then why do you keep that with you?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> ...Sigh, I can&#x27;t convince you so easily, can I? As a toji, I do my best not to think about sword polishing any more, but...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> You&#x27;re right. On the day I have to return my okatana to the Sword Administration, I plan on returning to my training as a sword polisher.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> To that end, while I may lack the time to improve myself, I at least cannot afford to let my skills grow dull.<br>
<strong>Niwa:</strong> I knew it!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="3-whats-got-you-in-a-trance"></a>3: What&#x27;s Got You in a Trance?<a class="hash-link" href="#3-whats-got-you-in-a-trance" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Mirja:</strong> Yes, the mountings of Shintougo Kunimitsu are a complete set, or so I&#x27;ve heard. For Kunimitsu, who specialized in daggers, to make a tachi, makes this an extremely peculiar item. Please handle it with the utmost care.<br>
<strong>Nagasaki Sumi:</strong> ...Ah, u-understood! I&#x27;ll take good care of it!<br>
<strong>Sumi:</strong> (Which country is this assistant from...? She&#x27;s so beautiful... It&#x27;s making me really nervous!)<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> We look forward to seeing you again.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Thanks for coming by-!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> This is crazy, Mirja-san! Customers just keep coming in one after another!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Everyone gathered to see the Origami family&#x27;s tournament, after all. Toji from across the country have gathered here in the Kanto region. I&#x27;m sure none of them want to pass up this opportunity while they&#x27;re still in the area.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> But then again, that girl just now was from Renpu, wasn&#x27;t she?<br>
<strong>Aoto Hina:</strong> Good work, you two. It&#x27;s not over yet, but are you feeling worn out?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Thank you for your concern. Due to my unfamiliarity, I fear I made a few careless mistakes, however I no longer feel the nervousness I did this morning.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Though, it seems there are some people who don&#x27;t feel such things in the first place.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Wait, Mirja-san, do you mean me?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> No, of course not. More importantly, Aoto Hina-san...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> As you are not only letting us stay overnight, but also providing me with this unique experience, you shouldn&#x27;t feel the need to thank me.<br>
<strong>Hina:</strong> Aw, you&#x27;re too sweet... No, you don&#x27;t have to be like that, Mirja-san! You&#x27;re already working for more than a hotel would cost, and you don&#x27;t have to make it sound like a special experience or nothing.<br>
<strong>Hina:</strong> More importantly, you seem like the kind of girl who can really hold her drink. Am I wrong, Mirja-san?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> What are you saying...?<br>
<strong>Hina:</strong> No use hiding it! You keep up that poker face, but your eyes keep racing all over.<br>
<strong>Hina:</strong> Like they just can&#x27;t settle on any one thing in here.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> ...Asakura Mihono.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Y-Yes!?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I will take care of the customers. You should head into the back with the others and help Aoto Youji-san take inventory.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Uh, okay!<br>
<strong>Hina:</strong> Mihono-chan! If my pa&#x27;s slacking off, give him a good kick for me! ...So now, Mirja-san~.<br>
<strong>Hina:</strong> What&#x27;s got you so interested?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> There are materials here collected from across the country. Guards, braids, hilts, scabbards... I can&#x27;t take my eyes off them.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Not just for okatana, but there are so many standard swords here as well. This is my first time seeing so many in one place. I feel deeply moved.<br>
<strong>Hina:</strong> Oh! Hun, you&#x27;ve got a real eye for detail~.<br>
<strong>Hina:</strong> You get it, you get it! Lately everything&#x27;s been trending towards &quot;if it&#x27;s not an okatana, it&#x27;s not a sword&quot;, but we&#x27;ve got an interest in plain old Japanese swordsmithing too!<br>
<strong>Hina:</strong> Though the Sword Administration&#x27;s got their thumb on most okatana, so most everything you see on the market is just made of standard steel. But these are real works of art, and they&#x27;ve still got their own value as weapons!<br>
<strong>Hina:</strong> Hun, I wonder if you can handle your &quot;swords&quot; too?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Is that expression common in your line of work?<br>
<strong>Hina:</strong> Nah, just a favorite of mine.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> In truth, I think it&#x27;s just as you&#x27;ve said, Hina-san. Among swordsmiths, the ones who made okatana have been remembered as legends, and have come to redefine the perception of a &quot;sword&quot;.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> However, the modern swordsmiths who have retained the old methods have then breathed new life into the traditional steel of antiquity.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> All in all, okatana cannot come to replace all swords. From old to new, they still have an equal amount of merit. That is what I believe.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> However... With antique steel, polishing can only get so far... Ah, not to demean the capabilities of sword polishers, but I&#x27;m a little out of touch with the practice myself.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> To make myself clear, with those methods of polishing, it can&#x27;t help but reduce the overall texture and thickness of the blade.<br>
<strong>Hina:</strong> Hey, are you picking a fight with Hina-san, who&#x27;s been studying sword polishing for 5 years now? Though I guess I&#x27;m still pretty fresh to it. Is it really that hard?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I see, you too... No, in the end, I&#x27;m only lamenting the extent of my own private interest in polishing.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> It&#x27;s important not only to bring out the beauty, but the highest sharpness of the blade as well. In that regard, I can&#x27;t help but scowl when I come across a crack in the edge.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> ...I have to apologize. I may have been projecting too much, and for that I&#x27;m sorry. You see, in the past, I aspired to become a sword polisher as well...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> To tell you the truth, even my Jikkyuu Mitsutada was an Akabane sword I personally restored...<br>
<strong>Hina:</strong> Whoa, really!? That&#x27;s so cool! Let me take a look...<br>
<strong>Matsunaga Yurina:</strong> ...Excuse me.<br>
<strong>Matsunaga Yurina:</strong> ...Umm.<br>
<strong>Matsunaga Yurina:</strong> ...I&#x27;d like to buy something.<br>

<strong>Kinuka:</strong> You know, how every unit in the Special Ritual Squad is based around the foundation of dividing roles into attacker, sub-attacker, and blocker?<br>
<strong>Kinuka:</strong> Well that&#x27;s based off the model the army&#x27;s special forces use, which was originally thought up with guns in mind.<br>
<strong>Kinuka:</strong> So there&#x27;s a new wave of complaints coming up about how it doesn&#x27;t really suit a practical situation for toji...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> But aren&#x27;t things fine as they are now?<br>
<strong>Nao:</strong> You of all people shouldn&#x27;t say that, Mirja~. Doesn&#x27;t your squad disregard the standard formation as much as possible? As far as I can tell, that doesn&#x27;t add up~?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> That&#x27;s where you&#x27;re wrong. I simply adjust each toji&#x27;s responsibilities to suit their strengths as the situation needs it.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> And you&#x27;re one to talk about disregarding theory, Uraga Nao. You tend to favor a strategy of encircling aradama, don&#x27;t you?<br>
<strong>Nao:</strong> Because I know I can always win like that~. Anyway, there aren&#x27;t many commanders as capable as you that can pull off your attitude in battle, you know~.<br>
<strong>Mizushina:</strong> Take it easy, you two. Look, the point I was trying to make is~ Hmm... How can I make this clear?<br>
<strong>Mizushina:</strong> Ah, I know just the thing! I&#x27;ll explain it through oranges!<br>
<strong>Mizushina:</strong> Ta-da-da-dah! First, I&#x27;ll write &quot;attacker&quot; on this one, and on its flank goes the &quot;sub-attacker&quot;... And after that... Huh? Where&#x27;d I put the attacker?<br>
<strong>Nao:</strong> (Chew Chew)<br>
<strong>Kinuka:</strong> Umm, well, I&#x27;ll just deploy another attacker orange... Uh? Now where&#x27;d the blocker go?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> (Chew Chew)<br>
<strong>Kinuka:</strong> That&#x27;s strange... Huh? I lost another attacker!? Ah...! Nao-san! Don&#x27;t eat them!<br>
<strong>Nao:</strong> I just can&#x27;t help it (Chew Chew), when you put an orange in front of me like that (Chew Chew), it&#x27;s hopeless~ (Swallow)<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Uraga Nao (Chew Chew), don&#x27;t you have any self control? No matter how much you (Chew) love them, the explanation cannot continue<br>
(Chew) if you keep eating them (Chew Chew).</p><p><strong>Nao:</strong> ...(Chew Chew).<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> ...(Chew Chew).<br>
<strong>Nao/Mirja:</strong> I can&#x27;t believe you!<br>
<strong>Kinuka:</strong> Hey! You&#x27;re in no place to judge!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="5-what-does-a-mission-mean-to-you"></a>5: What Does a &quot;Mission&quot; Mean to You?<a class="hash-link" href="#5-what-does-a-mission-mean-to-you" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Mirja:</strong> Setouchi Chie-san, there&#x27;s something I don&#x27;t understand. When you and I turned swords on each other, given the circumstances, I did not think I was mistaken in doing so.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> More than that, however... At the time, I felt there was a definitive difference between you and I. No, between myself and all the others.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> I think I get it... Mirja-san, what does a &quot;mission&quot; mean to you?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> My duty as a professional. Before, it meant leading my unit to success as a captain of the Special Ritual Squad. Now, it means guiding this investigation team in place of President Souraku.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> What of it?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> To me, a mission is an &quot;ideal&quot;. To grow closer with to those I&#x27;m working with and achieve a great ideal we all share.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I don&#x27;t quite understand the difference...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Does it sound too similar? Then... I supposed the difference is best expressed between &quot;To carry out orders&quot; and &quot;To want to carry out orders&quot;.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> .....<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> For example...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> To Mihono-chan, a mission means to defeat aradama. Well, not quite... &quot;To free everyone from being threatened by aradama&quot; is more like it. Regardless of what anyone actually orders her, that&#x27;s the mission she&#x27;ll assign herself.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> To Kofuki-chan, a mission means &quot;to kill every last aradama&quot;. That&#x27;s also the same as her way of life. Because of that, I&#x27;m sure Kofuki-chan doesn&#x27;t actually pay attention to what the mission specifies.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Kiyoka-chan has probably never been given a proper mission. She&#x27;s said she&#x27;s not even sure why she was picked to be a part of this investigation team.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Even so, President Gojou Iroha chose her to represent the Heijou Institute. Most likely because she has high expectations for Kiyoka-chan&#x27;s skill with a sword...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Thinking that, President Gojou Iroha&#x27;s unseen expectations most likely manifest as &quot;the hopes she will return having overcome her weakness&quot;. So Kiyoka&#x27;s mission is probably &quot;to at least be able to fight&quot;.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I see. They all... No, you as well, Setouchi Chie-san. Everyone aside from me acts in a way that seems very honest to themselves.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> However, I still cannot decide whether or not that&#x27;s a good thing. Is the way I conduct myself really the best approach?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Who knows? At least, I can&#x27;t answer that for you.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> ...You&#x27;re right. This doesn&#x27;t seem like something anyone else can answer for me. Perhaps what&#x27;s most important is to continue asking questions...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> But do things feel a little clearer now?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Yes. I&#x27;ve come to understand more of it. This may have seemed sudden, but I am still a novice at this.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> As such, it seems I&#x27;ll have to learn more from everyone about how they live their lives.  </p><div class="videoWrapper"><iframe width="640" height="480" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N8q9gtW9xcY"></iframe></div><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="valentines-part-1-mirja-sans-unexpected-side"></a>Valentines Part 1: Mirja-san&#x27;s Unexpected Side<a class="hash-link" href="#valentines-part-1-mirja-sans-unexpected-side" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Mirja:</strong> I heard from Kohagura Ellen.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Several small aradama escaped from them. They seem to be headed our way.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Even though small aradama can only cause relatively little damage, things like this are bound to happen with so few of us to handle them...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Yes, and from the public&#x27;s perspective, they feel threatened regardless of the severity, which can be troublesome. Especially in this case, which is causing so much unrest.<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> ...GYUAAAA!!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> They&#x27;re here already.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> You take the lead in dealing with them. I&#x27;ll be ready behind you, so don&#x27;t feel that you have to force yourself.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Of course, I trust you&#x27;ll take care of whatever I leave behind! --Let&#x27;s begin our attack!<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> Shaaa...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll pass me so easily! --And you too!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Phew...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I&#x27;ve gathered the chocolate and packaging materials the aradama left behind.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Though, couldn&#x27;t you have left some of the fighting to me back there?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I was able to attack with all I had knowing you would be supporting me.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> You can be unexpectedly aggressive at times. How surprising.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> In combat, I bear in mind that I need to calmly give orders. However, I won&#x27;t deny I do feel that way inside.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Nice work, Hanahana, Mirja.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Thanks to you two, we managed to finish the battle without much damage to the mall!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I wanted to get all of them... They were so weak, but they kept moving all over.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> You can&#x27;t exactly tell an aradama to sit still, after all.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> You may be strong, Tsubakuro Yume, but working as a team allows us to reduce the risks of danger or failure.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> But I want every chance I can get... To show how strong I am!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I think that will and ambition of yours to be strong is wonderful.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Next time an aradama shows up, just leave them to me. I won&#x27;t screw up.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> In that case, while it&#x27;s necessary to adapt to the needs of every situation, we can form our battle plan around you, Tsubakuro Yume.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I don&#x27;t mind, but what do you two think?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> I don&#x27;t have any problem with it either.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Then that settles it! You better watch me close~.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Good. Now, why don&#x27;t we return to the sweets shop. We also have a job to do there.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Before we start working, let&#x27;s snack on some cake.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Certainly; the cakes they make do have exceptional flavor.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> I see even you&#x27;ve turned into a big fan of theirs, Mirja.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> There&#x27;s nothing wrong with having a sweet tooth.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="valentines-part-2-mirja-san-is-meticulous"></a>Valentines Part 2: Mirja-san is Meticulous<a class="hash-link" href="#valentines-part-2-mirja-san-is-meticulous" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I&#x27;ll compile a report covering the progress the operation has made and the chocolate and packaging materials found from aradama.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> That would be a great help. If we could find some regularity to their behavior, it would make dealing with them in the future that much easier.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> That&#x27;s what I hope to accomplish. Though, all we can do is pray the analysis team can bring back good findings. Anyway, you&#x27;ll have to excuse me for the time being.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I&#x27;ll start helping with the shop then.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Oh, Ellen-san.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Hey look, it&#x27;s Kiyoka. What brings you here? Are you helping with the aradama too?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Sorry, I&#x27;m not, I&#x27;m just an ordinary customer. I found out about this shop from how popular it&#x27;s been online and in magazines lately.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> And since Valentines is so close... I wanted, um... To look at some chocolate.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> You&#x27;re good with girly things, aren&#x27;t you, Kiyoka. Will it be a present for the person you like?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah, no... I-It&#x27;s not like that, though I do admire them... This is for a female friend.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> I see. What kind of chocolate would you reccomend in that case, Mirja?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah-! You look so cute in that uniform, Mirja-san!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Thank you. I thought it might be a little too cute for me, but I&#x27;m glad to hear you feel that way.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> A chic ensemble really suits you, but seeing you in such a cute style like that, you can definitely pull it off too!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I&#x27;d like to ask you about that another time then. But for now, allow me to make you some recommendations.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> First we have this chocolate ganache cake. The ganache is made using milk chocolate and cream, to give it a refined and pleasing sweetness that melts in your mouth.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> And here we have this layered chocolate cake, separated by framboise jam. From the sponge of the cake to the cream on top, the jam gives the chocolate a uniquely sweet accent that makes this a fine choice.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> As these are both in high demand, I recommend either of them. Though if you had something else in mind, I can propose something else.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Mirja-san... You&#x27;re like a real shopkeeper.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> And I should mention, none of that was from the manual. It&#x27;s all Mirja&#x27;s personal recommendations...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I&#x27;ve been trying them during our breaks as well. Because of that, I thought I might as well use my experience to give a thorough explanation to curious customers.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That&#x27;s just like you, Mirja-san. In that case, I think I&#x27;ll go with the chocolate ganache cake. You made it sound delicious!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Thank you very much. With the chocolate cream, it would be best if you let the person you&#x27;re giving it to know they should eat it as soon as possible.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Okay. I think they&#x27;ll be happy with this.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Anyway, I&#x27;ll see you later. Please do your best working both here and with your toji duties.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Kohagura Ellen. It&#x27;s about time you started helping with our work here too.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> You seem like you&#x27;re having no problem taking care of things by yourself, but I&#x27;ll go get ready~.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> (Whether it be as a toji or as staff of this cake shop, I feel that I&#x27;ve done a good job today.)<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> No, the day isn&#x27;t over yet. I can&#x27;t let my guard down.  </p><div class="videoWrapper"><iframe width="640" height="480" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vrh9FfXuL1I"></iframe></div><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="new-years-mirja-start-mirjas-first-shrine-visit-of-the-year"></a>[New Year&#x27;s Mirja: Start] Mirja&#x27;s First Shrine Visit of the Year<a class="hash-link" href="#new-years-mirja-start-mirjas-first-shrine-visit-of-the-year" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Mirja:</strong> As one would expect, there are a great number of people out for New Year&#x27;s Day. Let&#x27;s all take caution so that no one gets lost.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Okay! You got it, Mirja-san!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> ...I don&#x27;t see anyone besides you, Yamashiro Yui. What happened to the others?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> While you were talking, they all got swept away in the crowd!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I see.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> There&#x27;s nothing we can do if we&#x27;ve already become separated. I&#x27;ll notify everyone to make their first shrine visit on their own.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> So basically, that means I get to make my first shrine visit all alone with you?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> That&#x27;s how it is.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Hyaa~! I&#x27;m so excited~!!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Yamashiro Yui, I propose we take measures to avoid splitting up any further. Put out your hand.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Y-You don&#x27;t mean...!?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> We&#x27;ll hold hands.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ahh, give me a second, give me a second pleaseee! I&#x27;ll take my glove off right now!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Wh-What do I do about my hand sweating... Ahh, Mirja-san&#x27;s hand, it&#x27;s so rough... Wait, you&#x27;re wearing a glove!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Will you please wear a glove as well? Your hand will get frostbite.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> After you put your glove back on, we&#x27;ll get in line to visit the shrine.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Wha-- You mean that line that looks like it&#x27;ll for sure take an hour to get through!? You know that lovers always break up because of long waits in lines, don&#x27;t you!?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> We came here to make our first shrine visit, so of course I do. And also, where did you learn that statistic?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> From my own research!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> And so, for the sake of our future together, we should go draw our fortunes first!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> ...Mirja-san, isn&#x27;t it kind of like we&#x27;re on a date together?  Kyaa! I said it!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Is the short performance over now? If so, let&#x27;s draw our fortune slips.	[The term Mirja uses, koshibai, literally small play, refers to plays that were too small to be performed in theaters and were traditionally held at shrines.]<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Hm, mine reads &quot;great fortune&quot;. That&#x27;s how it is then.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> You got a great fortune, Mirja-san? Since I&#x27;m a fortune drawing pro, I&#x27;ll do it too!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> There-! ...Wait, &quot;great misfortune&quot;!?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Wh-Wh-Wh-What do we do about this, Mirja-san!?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Calm down, Yamashiro Yui. At this shrine, they have an offering box where you can deposit misfortune and great misfortune slips.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> After doing that, your great misfortune is meant to turn into great strength.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I&#x27;ll go put my great misfortune in the box right away!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> If you run, you&#x27;ll trip and fall.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Don&#x27;t worry! A toji wouldn&#x27;t trip-- WAGH-!?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Just as I was telling you... Yamashiro Yui, is your leg alright?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Mirja-san is stroking my leg...! Is this my great strength already taking effect!?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> What are you even saying?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> ...Achoo. It&#x27;s getting slightly colder, isn&#x27;t it. After you&#x27;ve deposited your great misfortune slip, let&#x27;s go warm ourselves up some.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Eh-!? You&#x27;re going to warm me up... Where are you planning on taking me!?  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="new-years-mirja-end-prayer"></a>[New Year&#x27;s Mirja: End]: Prayer<a class="hash-link" href="#new-years-mirja-end-prayer" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Mirja:</strong> Sweet sake truly does warm you up, doesn&#x27;t it.<br>

<strong>Yui:</strong> You don&#x27;t have to apologize~! I already knew all along it wouldn&#x27;t be anything like that~!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Alright then. Still, this sweet sake is delicious, isn&#x27;t it?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Would you like another cup, Yamashiro Yui?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Hey, that&#x27;s no good, Mirja-san! What are you planning on doing to me, making me drink this much!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I&#x27;m not going to do anything, and this sweet sake is made from malted rice, without the lees of actual sake, so it won&#x27;t do anything to you either.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Now then, why don&#x27;t we get in line, now that it&#x27;s grown shorter?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Sure! By the way, did you know this, Mirja-san? When you pray to god, it&#x27;s supposed to be better if you state your name and home address, then make your wish.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Is that true? You&#x27;re well informed, Yamashiro Yui.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> There&#x27;s something I want to be granted no matter what. Whether I have to ask a god or anything for help, I&#x27;ll try whatever I can.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> So that&#x27;s why, I looked up a lot of things.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I see. I hope that wish of yours is granted then.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Yeah!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> By the way, Mirja-san, are you going to pray for something? I can&#x27;t even picture you praying to god for anything.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I have wishes I want to be granted too. What exactly do you take me for?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Eh, but you don&#x27;t have any flaws or weaknesses, do you, Mirja-san? That&#x27;s why, if I had to say... You&#x27;re a beautiful robot girl?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ah, that sounds perfect actually! Your eyes are shiny and all!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Could you not treat someone like they&#x27;re a robot?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I&#x27;m just kidding! More importantly, please tell me what you&#x27;re going to wish for!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> For the investigation team to accomplish their duties.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> ...That&#x27;s not really a wish, is it?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Ahh, you have a point. Thinking on it, rather than a wish, it might be more of a promise I plan to impose on myself.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I like that about you too!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I have high expectations that the investigation team will be able to become an even better team.<br>

<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Oh yeah, that happened, didn&#x27;t it. It was that time with the historical drama thing, right?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> If you mean that, I remember it too! Sayaka-chan was extra cute back then, wasn&#x27;t she!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> It seems the director from then has made another offer.<br>

<strong>Kofuki:</strong> What&#x27;s she talking about now.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> No, that isn&#x27;t entirely wrong... It seems that, somehow, they remember me from then, and made an offer.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> See!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> What&#x27;re you looking all smug for!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Anyway, I&#x27;m 100% going to go see it, Mirja-san! I&#x27;ll see it 7 million 7 hundred and 70 thousand times!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Actually, when are they filming it! I want to go watch!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> On Halloween day.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Halloween day!?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> That&#x27;s when I was supposed to go with Kanami-chan and them to their Halloween event...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Gununu... Do I go see Kanami-chan and Hiyori-chan in their costumes, or do I go see Mirja-san...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I should mention, along with myself, Itomi Sayaka and Iwakura Sanae will also be performing.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Sayaka-chan and Sanae-san too!? B-Both of them are hard to pass up...<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> You&#x27;re making a pretty funny face now, y&#x27;know?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> How can I choose though!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> No matter how much you puzzle over it, I won&#x27;t bring you with me. This is work.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I understand...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I&#x27;ll wait with bated breath to see the precious sight of Mirja-san when the movie opens, and prioritize the event where I&#x27;ll only have one chance to see Kanami-chan and everyone!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> That isn&#x27;t what I meant... Though, if you can accept that, then it&#x27;s fine.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Well, if that&#x27;s how it is, then you&#x27;d better get your body in shape for it.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Here, eat these niboshi. Want some milk with that too?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> ...Why niboshi and milk?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> If they&#x27;re asking for you, it&#x27;s cause they want you to play a kaiju, right? You&#x27;ve gotta be at least two meters for it then.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Of course I wouldn&#x27;t receive an offer to play a kaiju. ...I will be playing a nun.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> A nun? That&#x27;ll be a laugh.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> That&#x27;s not true! She&#x27;d look just perfect as one!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Well, either way, give it your best shot. I&#x27;ll be looking forward to it.<br>

<strong>Mirja:</strong> Are you not going to check the script?<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> No, I&#x27;ll be okay even if I don&#x27;t.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> (Her trembling has stopped. Is she the type who grows stronger when it comes time to act?)<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Let&#x27;s go, Iwakura Sanae.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Yes!<br>
<strong>Staff:</strong> Alright now... Ready-, start!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> That sound... From upstairs...?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> (...Suspcious of the sounds coming from the second floor, I go to investigate. When I climb the to top of the stairs, next comes...)<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> KYAAAAAAAAAA!!<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Ahahahaha! For you to be so shocked, my mischief was a big sucess nya!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> J-Just what are you!<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> What am I? Just a plain old cat, nya.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> You demon cat... I-I&#x27;ll destroy you here!<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> You can go ahead and try, nya!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> (Iwakura Sanae comes rushing in... I fight back with the candlestick I&#x27;m holding.)<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Unyaa!?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> It&#x27;s afraid of the flames...? Then!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> (Throwing the candlestick, while she&#x27;s frightened by the flames, I take the knife I had hidden...!)<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> UNYAAAAAAAAAA!! I&#x27;LL REMEMBER THIS, NYAAAAA!!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> ... It ran away? ...What is happening in this mansion...?<br>
<strong>Staff:</strong> Okaaay, that&#x27;s good.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Phew, nicely done, Iwakura Sanae. Thanks to your performance, we were able to make a fine action scene.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Not at all! It&#x27;s because of you, Mirja-san, that I think I was able to act so well!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Then, why don&#x27;t we say it&#x27;s because of the both of us?<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Alright! Ahh... Now that that&#x27;s over, I&#x27;m feeling kind of hungry.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> In that case, once Itomi Sayaka&#x27;s scene is finished, how about we go to eat together?<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Sure thing! There&#x27;s a delicious mizusawa udon place close by!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Mizusawa udon is the udon of Gunma, isn&#x27;t it? This isn&#x27;t Gunma, though?<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> I looked it up beforehand, thinking it could come in handy!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I-I see...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> (What exactly was she expecting to need it for... Though, Iwakura Sanae seems to be happy about it... Well, there&#x27;s no harm in it.)<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Then, I&#x27;ll be looking forward to it.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Sure! Please do!  </p><div class="videoWrapper"><iframe width="640" height="480" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vMJ0ViPK_JA"></iframe></div><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="swimsuit-20---mirja-start-stroll"></a>[Swimsuit 20 - Mirja: Start]: Stroll<a class="hash-link" href="#swimsuit-20---mirja-start-stroll" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>On a day off...</p><p><strong>Yui:</strong> Hahh... Hahh... Heeh... Heeh...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ffh... Ffh... Hehh... Hehh...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Yamashiro Yui.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Wh-What is it, Mirja-san...?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> You didn&#x27;t need to follow me along on my stroll, you know?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> We all had the opportunity to come here together on vacation.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> It isn&#x27;t too late for you to turn back. Why not go enjoy yourself with Asakura Mihono and the others?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> No way, I&#x27;m not going back! I&#x27;ll be there to protect your pale skin, Mirja-san...!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Until I rub sunscreen all over you with my own hands!!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Anyway, because it&#x27;s down by the river, the air here is cooler than I expected.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> And there&#x27;s such fine weather today.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> That&#x27;s for sure, it is really nice out...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> ......In spite of that, it looks to me like you&#x27;re struggling quite a bit?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> That&#x27;s because... I couldn&#x27;t sleep much last night, and I didn&#x27;t eat breakfast either...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Honestly... Here, have this.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Is that ramune? Thanks......<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> PFHAGH!?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> What&#x27;s with this!? It&#x27;s sweet and sour and bitter and solid and salty and sourly sour!?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> It&#x27;s the ramune Ban Tsugumi gave me to combat the summer heat.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Kn-Knowing that it&#x27;s Tsugumi-san&#x27;s... I&#x27;m not surprised it&#x27;s awful...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> ...It looks like it was a little overwhelming.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Why don&#x27;t we stop and take a short rest here?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Sounds great!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Mirja-san, since we&#x27;re already in our swimsuits, let&#x27;s go in the river!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Do you not want to...?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> No, it is what we came here for, so I&#x27;ll enjoy myself as well.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="swimsuit-20---mirja-end-a-short-rest"></a>[Swimsuit 20 - Mirja: End]: A Short Rest<a class="hash-link" href="#swimsuit-20---mirja-end-a-short-rest" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Yui:</strong> YAHOOO-!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Phew... This feels so good...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Mirja-saaan! Hurry up and come in the river!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> ...?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> What are you just staring at the water for-!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> ...The wildlife in this mountain river must be abundant.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Where&#x27;d that come from...?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> They moved away when you jumped in, but I saw the shapes of fish swimming.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I didn&#x27;t exactly get a good look at them... Given the season, perhaps they were Ayu?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> You think so?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> You can also catch Amago, Yamame, and Iwana during the summertime. Though, I&#x27;m unsure if those fish would be in this river here...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> We should&#x27;ve brought a fishing rod with us. If there were that many fish, we might&#x27;ve been able to go all out for our lunch.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> True, we potentially could have, though... As beginners, I&#x27;m not sure how many we would be able to fish out...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Well, forget about that for now; hurry up and come in the water!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Alright then... Mm!?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> What&#x27;s wrong?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Just now, a spider went drifting by.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> A spider!?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Wh-Wh-Wh-Where was it!?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> It&#x27;s about to pass right in front of you.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Eh? ...GYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Mirja-san, there&#x27;s a spider! A spider!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> It isn&#x27;t a venomous spider, so you shouldn&#x27;t worry. It won&#x27;t harm you.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> That doesn&#x27;t help! There&#x27;s no maiden in the world who&#x27;d keep calm with a spider in front of their face!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Can I hug onto you for safety!?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Absolutely not.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Looking around more, there sure are a lot of bugs... Eep!?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> We are out in nature, so that&#x27;s only natural.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Phew, that was a good rest. Now then, to continue our stroll.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> You aren&#x27;t getting in after all!?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> You were just toying with me, Mirja-san~! But, you treating me like that feels pretty nice too!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> ...What are you talking about? I&#x27;ll leave you behind.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Wait for meee~!  </p><div class="videoWrapper"><iframe width="640" height="480" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f6NzJE7uOCo"></iframe></div><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="mahouka---mirja-start-mirja-and-mayumi"></a>[Mahouka - Mirja: Start]: Mirja and Mayumi<a class="hash-link" href="#mahouka---mirja-start-mirja-and-mayumi" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Mirja:</strong> ...I see, so that&#x27;s what kind of magic you have, Saegusa Mayumi.<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> That&#x27;s it. At the Nine Schools Competition, I finished with a perfect bullseye. With a &quot;bang!&quot;<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Going back, what is this Nine Schools Competition?<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> Ah, that&#x27;s right, you wouldn&#x27;t have a Nine Schools Competition here.<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> If I say it&#x27;s... a competitive magic tournament, does that make it easy to picture?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Yes, that&#x27;s easily understandable.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Hm... With that magic, you would be highly beneficial when fighting against aradama...<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> Anyway, putting that aside, are you feeling peckish? It&#x27;s about lunchtime, isn&#x27;t it?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> You&#x27;re right, now would be a good time for it.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Oh, that&#x27;s... Asakura Mihono with Shiba Miyuki.<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> They seem to be enjoying themselves quite a lot, though, I wonder what they&#x27;re talking about?<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> Let&#x27;s go see, Kitora-san.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> You look like you&#x27;re having a good time, Asakura Mihono.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah, Mirja-san, Mayumi-san!<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> What were you talking about with Asakura-san, Miyuki-san?<br>
<strong>Miyuki:</strong> I was just speaking a little about Onii-sama.<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> About Tatsuya-kun?<br>
<strong>Academy Announcement:</strong> An appearance of aradama has been confirmed. Please prepare to sortie at once. I repeat--<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Aradama!<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> We&#x27;ll lend a hand. Won&#x27;t we, Miyuki-san?<br>
<strong>Miyuki:</strong> Yes, of course.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> ...That would be helpful.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> In that case, Shiba Miyuki, I leave you with Asakura Mihono. Saegusa Mayumi will be with me.<br>
<strong>Mihono/Miyuki:</strong> Right.<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> Will pairing off like this be alright?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> While magic may not be able to exorcise aradama, Shiba Miyuki&#x27;s magic is effective against them.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Paired with Asakura Mihono, she should be able to cover for her, just in case.<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> You really are considerate of your kouhai, aren&#x27;t you, Kitora-san. I had pictured you as someone more logically driven.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Logically driven...? It&#x27;s true that Asakura Mihono is a valuable member of our investigation team.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Though, Saegusa Mayumi. If I had left Asakura Mihono with you, I don&#x27;t believe you would let anything go wrong either.<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> I&#x27;m honored to hear it. Well, let&#x27;s get going.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="mahouka---mirja-end-elven-sniper"></a>[Mahouka - Mirja: End]: Elven Sniper<a class="hash-link" href="#mahouka---mirja-end-elven-sniper" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Mirja:</strong> Now then, Saegusa Mayumi. The two types of magic you explained to me before... Magic Bullet Shooter and Multi-Scope.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> With those two, we should be able to suppress aradama with ease.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> After all, you are capable of carrying out a one-sided assault on aradama from distance without needing to enter their range.<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> That&#x27;s true.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Then I will be the one to perform the finishing blow...<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> GGGGGOOOOOUUUUU!!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> -! Saegusa Mayumi!<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> Of course.<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> GUOOO!?<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> GYAAA!?<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> OOOOO!?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> She took care of three simultaneously..<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> Two more are coming from the front, and another three from the right hand side. I&#x27;ll pin them down, so could you please finish off those three?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I&#x27;m on it!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> HAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> (A perfect bullseye, hm... Her precision is frightening.)<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> ...There&#x27;s nothing that could be more reassuring.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> YAAAAAAAAAAAA!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> We finished suppressing the aradama, Mirja-san! Miyuki-san was really incredible!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> We can speak about that more later. Then, when we next meet.<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> It sounds like Asakura-san and Miyuki-san safely suppressed their aradama too.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Yes, though Asakura Mihono&#x27;s strange excitement has me concerned...<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> You think she might have fallen in love with Miyuki-san&#x27;s magic?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> That might be the case. Though, you were excellent yourself, Saegusa Mayumi.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I didn&#x27;t think that, just by having long range support, it would make such a dramatic difference in efficiency...<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> Would you try recreating it after you wake up from this dream?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> That would be difficult to accomplish. Multi-Scope and Magic Bullet Shooter.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I believe this was only possible because of how skilled you are at manipulating the both of them.<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> Thank you for the compliments, Kitora-san.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I meant it. That aside, the aradama interrupted us when we were about to have lunch just now.<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> They did; I&#x27;m famished at this point. Even though it&#x27;s a dream. It&#x27;s a strange feeling, isn&#x27;t it?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I feel the same. What do you say we find something to eat close by?<br>

<strong>Yui:</strong> Ah, found her! Miiirja-saaan~!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Yamashiro Yui? As well as...<br>
<strong>Morishita Kihiro:</strong> Really-, we&#x27;ve been looking all over for you! Miss Kitora!<br>
<strong>Haji Keiko:</strong> H-Hello...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Morishita Kihiro and Haji Keiko. You three make a rare group.<br>
<strong>Kihiro:</strong> You might be right there!<br>
<strong>Kihiro:</strong> Though, despite myself coming from the equipment department and Miss Haji from the engineering preparatory department, we&#x27;ve long since deepened our friendship!<br>
<strong>Keiko:</strong> Eh!?<br>
<strong>Kihiro:</strong> But you&#x27;re right that we have little in common with Miss Yamashiro here! ...What seems to be the matter, Miss Haji?<br>
<strong>Keiko:</strong> I-It&#x27;s... nothing.<br>
<strong>Keiko:</strong> (Deepened... our friendship...?)<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> So then, did you need me for something?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Yes! Though, I&#x27;m not really the one looking for you; that&#x27;s these two!<br>
<strong>Kihiro:</strong> What are you saying, Miss Yamashiro! With you offering your assistance, we&#x27;re all of one heart and mind!<br>
<strong>Kihiro:</strong> In short! The three of us have one common cause!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> ...Haji Keiko, please give me the essentials.<br>
<strong>Keiko:</strong> R-Right... Actually, we were thinking we wanted you to help with our assignment, Kitora-san...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Your assignment?<br>
<strong>Kihiro:</strong> As a matter of fact, we&#x27;ve been assigned to build one motorcycle!<br>
<strong>Kihiro:</strong> Soon enough, we&#x27;ll be unveiling it to the public-- but as reasons go, we&#x27;re lacking staff on that day! We&#x27;d very much like your help, Miss Kitora!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I&#x27;m not against helping you, but, sadly, I don&#x27;t know much about motorcycles.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Why not ask someone more suited for this? Someone like Inago Akira should be up to the task.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Actually, we asked Boss, but she couldn&#x27;t make it...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> You&#x27;re the only one we can turn to, Mirja-san!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> And anyway, what we&#x27;re missing is someone to help draw in visitors, so it&#x27;s not like you even need to know about motorcycles!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>All 3:</strong> Please help us!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> ...Fine then. If you&#x27;re that set on it, I&#x27;ll help you out.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Hooray-! This is why I love you, Mirja-san!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Morishita Kihiro, Haji Keiko. Could you give me a specific schedule for the event?<br>
<strong>Kihiro:</strong> Sure thing! We&#x27;re glad to have you, Miss Kitora! Really, what a stroke of luck, Miss Haji!<br>
<strong>Keiko:</strong> Y-Yes... But, err... No, it is lucky...<br>
<strong>Kihiro:</strong> We&#x27;ve done it, Miss Haji! Now we&#x27;re 100% prepared for the unveiling!<br>
<strong>Keiko:</strong> Um, but... Is this really okay? I feel like we didn&#x27;t tell her the important part...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Don&#x27;t worry about it, Keiko-san! We don&#x27;t have to tell her about &quot;that&quot; until just before we start!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Mufufu~! Ahh~, now I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;ll wait for the day after tomorrow~!<br>

<strong>Mirja:</strong> Do what you want.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> More importantly, Morishita Kihiro. Let&#x27;s go over once more what will happen when we get there.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Firstly, as I&#x27;m in charge of reaching out to visitors...<br>
<strong>Kihiro:</strong> Ahh, we lied about that.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Huh?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Hey!? It&#x27;s too soon to spill the beans!!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> ...Too soon to spill the beans. And what do you mean by that, Yamashiro Yui?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Well, uh, we didn&#x27;t lie so much, Mirja-san. Loosely speaking, we do want you attracting visitors...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Haji Keiko?<br>
<strong>Keiko:</strong> M-Me!?<br>
<strong>Kihiro:</strong> Please don&#x27;t glare at Miss Haji like that, Miss Kitora. She was saying we should give a proper explanation until the bitter end.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> ...Right, I think I have an idea of what&#x27;s going on. Yamashiro Yui is behind this, isn&#x27;t she?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Teheh.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> &quot;Teheh&quot; doesn&#x27;t make up for this.<br>
<strong>Kihiro:</strong> To give a perfectly crisp and clear explanation, we&#x27;d like you to be a race queen for us, Miss Kitora!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> A... race queen.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> So, what are you making me wear?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ehehe! Take a look, Mirja-san! This is it!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> To sum it up... I wear this, sit on the motorcycle, and attract people...<br>
<strong>Kihiro:</strong> As a staff member attracting visitors in the broadest sense, you&#x27;re our billboard.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Keiko:</strong> I-I&#x27;m sorry... We were actually going to hire a professional to do this...<br>
<strong>Kihiro:</strong> You see, while building the motorcycle, my gen~ius instincts went and caught fire.<br>
<strong>Kihiro:</strong> And, while remodeling here and there, we completely spent through our budget.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> That&#x27;s when I happened to hear about all this, and thought, why not ask Mirja-san?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> With your bombshell body, there&#x27;s no way you wouldn&#x27;t look great in it!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> ...Unbelievable.<br>
<strong>Keiko:</strong> Um... Are you not going to do it afer all...?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> No, I will. I wouldn&#x27;t turn you down after coming this far. I&#x27;m not happy about it, but all I can do is resign myself to this...<br>
<strong>Cameraman:</strong> Excuse me-. Would you mind giving a look over this way-?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Li... like this?<br>
<strong>Cameraman:</strong> Thanks a lot! That&#x27;s perfect!<br>
<strong>Man:</strong> Hey, check out the cowling on that bike...! The design, materials, functionality; they&#x27;re all first rate.<br>
<strong>Woman:</strong> I can tell. And, the parts used here...! That&#x27;s an interesting make, but what purpose does it serve? Hmm, I&#x27;d really like to find out.<br>
<strong>Kihiro:</strong> Mmhm! Just as we&#x27;d planned, Miss Haji! Our motorcycle is the center of attention!<br>
<strong>Kihiro:</strong> Now then! Let&#x27;s hurry over and give our guests an explanation!<br>
<strong>Keiko:</strong> Right...! I&#x27;m very glad, that we worked so hard on this assignment...!<br>
<strong>Mirja</strong>ï¼š (...From the sound of it, this motorcycle has incredible workmanship. That at least makes it worth me enduring the shame of dressing as a race queen.)</p><p><strong>Mirja:</strong> (Though--)<br>

<strong>Senpai Toji:</strong> I won&#x27;t be able to go and cheer you on, but give it your best shot there.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I will. As one of the selected representatives, I plan to do my best not to dishonor Ayanokouji&#x27;s reputation.<br>

<strong>Mirja:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> (As always... being alone performing maintenance on an okatana gives me the best chance to examine myself.)<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> (I&#x27;m only mindlessly working my hands, and yet Jikkyu Mitsutada is showing me things I wouldn&#x27;t ordinarily notice... That&#x27;s the feeling I get.)<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Still, to make both my senpai and kouhai worried... How pathetic of me.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> It seems that... It&#x27;s strange to admit, but losing to Shidou Maki must have been somewhat of a shock to me... I think.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I wasn&#x27;t conceited, but challenging her with everything I had and losing is frustrating... Faced with her sword, I was shown the true extent of her strength. And, that might not be something I can reach with just my swordsmanship.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> It&#x27;s not that I have any intention of neglecting my training, but...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> As a toji, what sort of path should I explore from here?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> ...Heh. Jikkyuu Mitsutada isn&#x27;t going to tell me that much, is it.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="misogi---mirja-end-what-must-be-polished-is-you-yourself"></a>[Misogi - Mirja: End]: What Must Be Polished is You Yourself<a class="hash-link" href="#misogi---mirja-end-what-must-be-polished-is-you-yourself" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Mirja:</strong> We&#x27;ll be in trouble if it comes out from blind spots behind the trees!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Let&#x27;s move out into the open and engage from there. Fortunately, the aradama appears to be pursuing us.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> (I won&#x27;t show as shameful a performance as last time. I&#x27;m focused.)<br>
<strong>Senpai Toji:</strong> I&#x27;m not happy about that one bit though...<br>
<strong>Senpai Toji:</strong> But, it&#x27;ll be easier fighting like Kitora said. Let&#x27;s go!<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> ......!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> It&#x27;s moving as anticipated. Now, let&#x27;s make our move.<br>
<strong>Kouhai Toji:</strong> U-Um! Is it really alright for me to be the one finishing it off...?<br>
<strong>Kouhai Toji:</strong> I think one of you senpais should do it.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> No, the two of us will halt its movements. At that point, please come at it from behind.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> If you&#x27;re unable to bring it down, we&#x27;ll immediately go on the attack.<br>
<strong>Senpai Toji:</strong> The way things are, that seems like the least risky way to beat it.<br>
<strong>Kouhai Toji:</strong> Alright then...!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Have confidence in yourself. --Here it comes!<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> SHAAaaaa...!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I&#x27;m sorry to have made the both of you worry about me on our last mission.<br>
<strong>Senpai Toji:</strong> It&#x27;s all good. You were more clear headed than usual today anyway. It helped see the fight from a different perspective.<br>
<strong>Senpai Toji:</strong> Some girls get so focused on the fighting they lose sight of what&#x27;s around them.<br>
<strong>Kouhai Toji:</strong> I also had a valuable experience here thanks to you, Kitora-senpai! I feel a little more confident now.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> It&#x27;s all because I had your cooperation. A toji&#x27;s duty is to exorcise aradama and protect the people. Toji should combine their strengths.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I recognized that once again here.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> (I don&#x27;t necessarily need to bring about overwhelming results with my swordsmanship. What&#x27;s important is that we accomplish our duties more safely.)<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> (Studying more into tactics for battle and managing a unit will surely be useful to me.)<br>
<strong>Senpai Toji:</strong> You look kinda like you got a weight off your shoulders there, Kitora.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Yes; because I&#x27;ve found a direction to go in.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> (When I participated in the tournament in my third year of middle school... and, the missions that came shortly after. I believe it was a good opportunity for me.)<br>
<strong>Uraga Nao:</strong> Hey, Mirja~? You listening~?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I am listening. As you two groan on about your post-high school graduation career paths.<br>
<strong>Nao:</strong> They make it sound like checking our career paths is no big deal, but this is tough~. They tell you to write down schools of choice too, if you&#x27;re going on to university.<br>
<strong>Mizushina Kinuka:</strong> Ah! Maybe I should write down Ayanokouji Martial Arts School as my school of choice. The best way to keep an eye on my little sister would be to get re-enrolled here-.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> The teacher is going to think you&#x27;re making a joke. And, how would your sister feel, having her older sister as her kouhai now?<br>
<strong>Kinuka:</strong> She&#x27;d be delighted, wouldn&#x27;t she!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Sigh... You too, Uraga Nao; why not work backwards and narrow down which faculty to pursue from your future dreams and goals?<br>
<strong>Nao:</strong> Ughh... I don&#x27;t want to hear you using logic on me now. What about you, Mirja? Are you already thinking about your career path and everything~?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I&#x27;m thinking of becoming an okatana polisher, once I lose my powers as a toji. Though, it&#x27;s only one possibility.<br>
<strong>Kinuka:</strong> Your family are swordsmiths... they&#x27;re polishers, right? And can&#x27;t you do it yourself too, Kitora-san?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I can. Even now, I keep in practice enough to not lose my skill. When I want to think something over, I feel like doing it while polishing an okatana.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Of course, I also check with professionals from time to time.<br>
<strong>Nao:</strong> Mirja, you&#x27;re totally okatana crazy~.<br>
<strong>Kinuka:</strong> Well, that&#x27;s nothing new.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I would like to continue polishing Akabane swords in the future.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> By polishing and restoring Akabane swords, it might lead to a rise in the number of toji accepted by okatana. That&#x27;s something I want to help with.<br>
<strong>Nao:</strong> Oh gosh... she has such a serious and well defined goal~...<br>
<strong>Kinuka:</strong> That sounds like something the teachers would take, no questions asked. But, wait, why have you been thinking this out more than us third years-!?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> ...That&#x27;s something I should be asking, as your kouhai. You should think more carefully about this, you two.  </p><div class="videoWrapper"><iframe width="640" height="480" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yi4RtIeXwzQ"></iframe></div><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="resort-dress---mirja-start-scouted"></a>[Resort Dress - Mirja: Start]: Scouted<a class="hash-link" href="#resort-dress---mirja-start-scouted" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Mirja:</strong> We were lucky we found that shop earlier.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> The whipped creme they had for dessert was especially well made.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> It was; I thought they were a bit expensive just for lunch, but I can understand why now.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Yes. Before our vacation is over, I&#x27;d like to bring Asakura Mihono back there.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Fufu, we should.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Do you think Mihono-chan&#x27;s finished having lunch with Inago-san by now?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> ...Oh, she&#x27;s sent us a message.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Ah, she did. Looks like she went with Inago-san to a family restaurant.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Maybe we should have uploaded pictures of our food too?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I don&#x27;t think we should. I can already imagine how annoying Yamashiro Yui would be, after missions kept her from coming along.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> You know Mirja, I&#x27;ve been thinking this for a while, but don&#x27;t you think you&#x27;re too hard on Yui-chan sometimes?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Am I?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Maybe that&#x27;s in large part due to her being my direct kouhai at Ayanokouji Martial Arts Academy.<br>
<strong>???:</strong> Excuse me, do you have a minute? I&#x27;d like to talk to you about this...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Hm? You&#x27;re a magazine reporter? Did you need something from us?<br>
<strong>Magazine Reporter:</strong> Do you have any interest in becoming a model?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> A model...?<br>
<strong>Magazine Reporter:</strong> Ahh, you don&#x27;t have to look so suspicious! We&#x27;re a small-time local magazine!<br>
<strong>Magazine Reporter:</strong> I&#x27;ll come right out and say it, I want you to be a model for us!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Don&#x27;t give them that look, Mirja. Let&#x27;s hear them out first.<br>
<strong>Magazine Reporter:</strong> Thank you very much.<br>
<strong>Magazine Reporter:</strong> The girl I&#x27;d asked to model for us suddenly couldn&#x27;t make it, so I&#x27;ve been looking for a substitute.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> But, why me?<br>
<strong>Magazine Reporter:</strong> You&#x27;re exactly the type of model I had in mind!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> So they say. It looks like they&#x27;re in a pinch, so why not help them out?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Still...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll be a nice experience for you.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Acting as if it&#x27;s someone else&#x27;s problem... Fine then. I&#x27;ll take your offer.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="resort-dress---mirja-end-model-debut"></a>[Resort Dress - Mirja: End]: Model Debut!<a class="hash-link" href="#resort-dress---mirja-end-model-debut" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> I can&#x27;t wait, Chii-nee!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> I know how you feel, Mihono-chan.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Did you already see what Mirja-san&#x27;s wearing, Chii-nee? What&#x27;d it look like? She must have looked really good, right?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> No, I haven&#x27;t gotten to see yet. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m excited too.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I&#x27;m glad to hear that, but it&#x27;s not all that different from what I typically wear.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> What&#x27;s wrong?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Mirja-san, you look so super pretty, all the words left my mouth...!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> I know, she really does... I&#x27;m surprised.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Do I really?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I didn&#x27;t think I looked that different from usual... Ahh, it must be because of the makeup.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> But she&#x27;s still the same old Mirja-san inside; the gap&#x27;s making my brain hurt...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Mihono-chan!? Mirja, you have to help Mihono-chan; start talking more like how you&#x27;re dressed!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> ...Stop getting so worked up over this, you two.<br>
<strong>Mihono/Chie:</strong> Okaaay.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> ............Huh?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> What am I doing here instead of there? I don&#x27;t get it. Huh?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Why is this happening; isn&#x27;t that like an event made for me?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Huhh?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Yui&#x27;s making this really awkward...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...That must have been so nice. I wish I could have been there to watch her model too.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Even Kiyoka&#x27;s doing it...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Damnit...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> What&#x27;s wrong with me; why didn&#x27;t I skip my missions to be there...!?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> ...Why are you crying over this?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> WHY WOULDN&#x27;T I BE CRYINGGGGGGGGGG!!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Now now.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> They said they would send us copies once the magazine is finished, so can you wait until then?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> They&#x27;ll what...!? I still have something to live for!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Mirja-san, if you do work as a model again, please take me along next time!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> You have to bring me too!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> ...I see I should have never taken the modeling job in the first place.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka/Yui:</strong> MIRJA-SAN!<br>
