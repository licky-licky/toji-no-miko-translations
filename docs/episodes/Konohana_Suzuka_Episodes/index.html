Ojou-samas<a class="hash-link" href="#1-dance-of-the-ojou-samas" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Mai:</strong> Good to see you, Konohana-san.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> And you as well, Yanase-san. It&#x27;s been quite some time since we met at a social gathering.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> That&#x27;s true. Lately, I&#x27;ve been spending more time on battlefields... Are you here accompanying your father as well, Konohana-san?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yes, networking is invaluable, after all. Meetings like this allow you to keep up with many people.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> And deepening your connections is never a waste.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> For the sake of the Konohana family, and more precisely, for my own sake.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> You&#x27;ve always had your act together. Compared to you, I--<br>
<strong>Woman:</strong> Kyaaaaa--!! L-Look outside; an aradama!!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> What was that!?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> What&#x27;s it doing out here...?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> We can think about that later. First, we need to destroy that aradama. Will you help me?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Yes, of course!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Then, we shouldn&#x27;t waste time. Let&#x27;s show this aradama where it&#x27;s not welcome.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Nicely done. Thankfully, we were able to deal with this before it became a serious incident.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I ended up on another battlefield, in the end.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> You&#x27;re right, now that you mention it. Perhaps that&#x27;s the fate of us toji.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> But, leaving that aside, you were about to say something strange before we were interrupted, weren&#x27;t you?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Something strange? Sorry, I don&#x27;t really remember?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> &quot;You&#x27;ve always had your act together. Compared to you, I--&quot;.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Surely you don&#x27;t mean to imply you haven&#x27;t been an accomplished person yourself?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I&#x27;m not implying anything; that&#x27;s just how it is...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> That joke isn&#x27;t as funny as you think.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> There aren&#x27;t many who could repeat the way you handled your okatana just now.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> That beautiful swordsmanship could only belong to one who thoroughly dedicated herself to training every day.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Therefore, please have more confidence in yourself. Your worries only weaken your resolve.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Konohana-san... Thank you very much.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> You don&#x27;t need to thank me.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Now then... The party seems to still be open. I should take my leave.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Farewell, Yanase-san. Until we meet on another battlefield.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Yes! Until we fight together again.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="2-the-ojou-sama-is-a-commoner"></a>2: The Ojou-sama is a Commoner<a class="hash-link" href="#2-the-ojou-sama-is-a-commoner" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Maki:</strong> What are you having for lunch, Suzuka?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> As for me, I&#x27;ve prepared this.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> That&#x27;s... Another convenience store bento? How many days in a row is that?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Unfortunately for you, that&#x27;s wrong. This isn&#x27;t a convenience store bento, but rather a bento from the supermarket&#x27;s deli corner.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> And would you look at this, right here! I found it at a 30% discount! Such great value, isn&#x27;t it?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> The ojou-sama is bragging about bargain bin deals...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I can&#x27;t overlook that. I&#x27;ve never once thought of myself as an ojou-sama, you know.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> If you aren&#x27;t one, then what even is an ojou-sama?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I&#x27;ve heard rumors that, in middle school, you rode in a different luxury car to school every day.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...? What&#x27;s so strange about that?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> So it&#x27;s true!? Why would you change cars every day? And luxury cars too!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I&#x27;m sorry? You&#x27;re the one saying strange things now. You change clothing every day, don&#x27;t you? Why would cars be any different?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Of course it&#x27;s different!! Don&#x27;t compare cars costing tens of millions of yen to clothes...!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> But outfits costing several tens of millions of yen aren&#x27;t all that uncommon, are they?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Your sense of money&#x27;s insane... That reminds me. There&#x27;s another rumor you were running late one day, so you had a helicopter airlift you to school.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> That&#x27;s a misunderstanding. Even I&#x27;ve never flown in a helicopter to school.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> It figures, that one&#x27;s just idle gossip...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yes, a helicopter wouldn&#x27;t have made it in time. I rode a Harrier instead.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Isn&#x27;t that a fighter jet!? I knew it; you&#x27;re an ojou-sama among ojou-samas.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> But I think I&#x27;m fairly ordinary, though?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Do I even want to know your definition of ordinary...?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Still, I&#x27;m surprised you not only go to convenience stores, but supermarkets too. Or do you have someone get these for you?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I&#x27;d never have someone do that for me. You must not be aware, Maki-san. Of how wonderful the supermarket is.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> The shelves are brimming with an endless variety of foods, and simply browsing through their collection of sweets is a joy.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> There&#x27;s so much to see that I could spend half a day there without losing interest in the slightest.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Ah, I know! If you&#x27;d like, will you join me next time? I can guide you around.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> S-Sure...  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="3-suzukas-duties"></a>3: Suzuka&#x27;s Duties<a class="hash-link" href="#3-suzukas-duties" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Excellent work. I&#x27;d expect no less from you, Yukari-sama. Even while negotiating with such veteran ministers, you didn&#x27;t give an inch. It was a valuable learning experience.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> With this, we should be able to act more freely. Another step toward my ideal.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> We can begin as soon as this bill takes effect. I&#x27;ll need you working harder than ever from here.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I&#x27;m well aware. I&#x27;ll gladly do everything I can to make your plans a reality, Yukari-sama.<br>
<strong>Man:</strong> .........<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> What are you doing? Clear the way, you&#x27;re being disrespectful.<br>
<strong>Man:</strong> ORIGAMIIIII!!<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Hm, an insurgent?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I won&#x27;t allow it.<br>
<strong>Man:</strong> GYAAAHH!!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Don&#x27;t worry, I merely used the back of the blade. I wouldn&#x27;t dirty Kujikanesada with the blood of a common rebel, after all.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Honestly, for one as helpless as you to make an attempt on Yukari-sama&#x27;s life was hopelessly naive.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> With an overambitious plan, someone must have put you up to it, didn&#x27;t they?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Prepare yourself. I&#x27;ll have you tell me everything.<br>
<strong>Man:</strong> ....Ghkhg!!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Wha!? What are you doing!?<br>
<strong>Man:</strong> .........<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> He&#x27;s dead... It seems he prepared a suicide capsule in the back of his teeth.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> This is inexcusable. To have lost such a valuable witness right from under me... Yukari-sama, I&#x27;ll accept any punishment you give.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> There&#x27;s no need. I have no interest in every insect crawling the ground in my way.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> As my desires are realized, many more like him will be flushed out. They&#x27;re not all worth my attention. Leave him where he lies.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...Understood.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Now then, come with me.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yes! Wherever you go, I will be at your side!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="4-the-time-we-spent-together"></a>4: The Time we Spent Together<a class="hash-link" href="#4-the-time-we-spent-together" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Maki:</strong> What&#x27;s the matter; your attacks are getting softer. Tired already?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Funny, coming from you. Your footwork is already slipping, Maki-san.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Now you&#x27;ve said it. How about this!?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Kuh...! How much longer can you go on!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Hah--!!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Oh, that was a good strike. For practice, you&#x27;re sure coming at me with a lot of passion. Reminds me of when we first met!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> And you&#x27;re taking this awfully casually, to go reminiscing about the past!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> That&#x27;s not true. I&#x27;m barely holding my ground.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> (She&#x27;s always grinning like that. Back then, I hated that smile from the bottom of my heart.)<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> (Maki-san&#x27;s okatana, &quot;Usumidori&quot;, is of special importance to practitioners of Kurama-Ryu. I was deeply jealous of her.)<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> (&quot;Usumidori&quot; was much more suited to be mine. I challenged her in the tournament, intending to prove that, but it ended in my defeat.)<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> (With my pride deeply wounded, my spite for her only grew stronger. I swore I would someday surpass her.)<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> (I even followed her as far as joining the elite guard.)<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> What are you smiling about?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Smiling? I was?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Yeah. I couldn&#x27;t believe it myself, but while you were fighting so passionately you had such a gentle smile on your face.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Seriously, you&#x27;re the one taking this casually, aren&#x27;t you?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I was simply reflecting on the past a little, is all.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> The past? I must not be a serious opponent for you, if you can happily walk down memory lane in the middle of a fight.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Isn&#x27;t that the case for you, Maki-san? You&#x27;ve done nothing but win against me lately. You have to be taking me lightly by now.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Suzuka, to me you&#x27;re a close friend I know I can rely on. But at the same time, I see you as my rival.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Every day I&#x27;m trying desperately not to be outdone by you. You never give me a spare moment to take you lightly.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...!? You&#x27;re always going on like that... Then, today&#x27;s the day I overtake you!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Not going to happen. Even in practice, you&#x27;re the one person I never want to lose to!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> That&#x27;s what I wanted to say! Regardless of anyone else, I have no intention of giving you an easy victory!<br>

<strong>Wakako:</strong> The sight of you at work is lovely enough to touch my heart, but without rest your body will start to suffer.<br>
<strong>Wakako:</strong> If your body were to give out on you... I wouldn&#x27;t be able to go on living!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> You&#x27;re always so dramatic. But, I do happen to be at a good stopping point. Let&#x27;s pause here for now.<br>
<strong>Wakako:</strong> Suzuka-sama, um, here... Try these, if it suits you.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> My, what delicious looking tarts. Just look at how the fruits are glistening. Where did you find these?<br>
<strong>Wakako:</strong> There&#x27;s a shop I often see featured in magazines; they made them. Actually, these tarts are so famous they regularly sell out the moment the shop opens.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Really? You did well in getting them then.<br>
<strong>Wakako:</strong> Yes, I was waiting in line since three this morning!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Y-You arrived that early?<br>
<strong>Wakako:</strong> I worked my hardest to ensure you could eat them, Suzuka-sama!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I appreciate your dedication, but there&#x27;s no need to go to such unreasonable lengths. It would be a serious issue if you came down ill as a result.<br>
<strong>Wakako:</strong> Suzuka-sama is worried about me... My heart feels like it could leap from my chest! I think I could live the rest of my life on those words alone!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Fufu, you sure love to exaggerate.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Sorry to interrupt. Suzuka, I brought orders for you.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Ara, Maki-san, you didn&#x27;t have to come all this way to deliver them.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> It&#x27;s a part of the job; don&#x27;t worry about it. I skimmed over it earlier. Our next mission seems fairly challenging.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Ara, are you losing your nerve? Don&#x27;t worry, I&#x27;ll cover your share of the work if you need me.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Who said anything like that!? I only wanted to warn you it looks difficult! It won&#x27;t be a problem for me!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Is that so? In any case, you can always depend on me being there to support you.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> That&#x27;s what I should be saying...<br>
<strong>Wakako:</strong> ...I&#x27;m really not fit to be the one standing at Suzuka-sama&#x27;s side, am I. She looks so much more splendid together with Maki-sama...<br>

<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yes, we will be going undercover.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Another report has come in from that wedding chapel of an aradama stealing a wedding ring.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Which means, someone will have to dress like a bride to lure the aradama out?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Should we defeat the aradama there though? Shouldn&#x27;t we work to get the stolen ring back?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> No, we have a ring equipped with a transmitter, so we only need the aradama to steal it.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I see, that makes sense.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> So you&#x27;ll be the bride, the aradama will steal the ring, we track where it goes, and this will all be solved.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Eh!?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Did I get something wrong?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> N-No... Only, I&#x27;ll be the bride? The members from the previous mission have all been gathered...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Of course, if there&#x27;s a chance you&#x27;ll be in danger, I&#x27;ll be right there to protect you. But wouldn&#x27;t it be best if we were the ones doing the dangerous work?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Y-You do have a point.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> And besides, instead of someone like me, you&#x27;d make a much more convincing bride, Suzuka.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> V-Very well then. I&#x27;ll play the bride to the best of my ability.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> There, I&#x27;ve put it on. Hopefully it can convince the aradama I&#x27;m a true bride...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> (Nonetheless... The design of this wedding dress is exquisite.)<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...Does it suit me, I wonder?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Even though I should be accustomed to wearing dresses... It&#x27;s strange. I&#x27;m feeling slightly nervous.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...Fu.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Maki-san? ...I&#x27;ve finished changing.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...Maki-san?<br>
<strong>Chapel Staff:</strong> Oh, if you&#x27;re looking for Shidou-san, she said she would patrol the chapel while you get changed.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> How typical of her.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> It would be a waste to wait for her return, so I&#x27;ll go on patrol as well.<br>
<strong>Chapel Staff:</strong> Of course, please do.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...May I ask you something?<br>
<strong>Chapel Staff:</strong> What&#x27;s that?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...This doesn&#x27;t look strange on me, does it?<br>
<strong>Chapel Staff:</strong> No, it&#x27;s a perfect fit.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Thank you very much...

<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Oh? Over there, that&#x27;s... Yomi-san, Ban-san. So you two were stationed here.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Satsuki-san, shouldn&#x27;t you say something more? On average, brides enjoy compliments.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> You look very nice, Konohana-san.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Well, I do appreciate the flattery.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> But more importantly, have either of you seen Maki-san around?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Shidou-san? I haven&#x27;t seen her.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I spoke with her a little about our patrols.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> How long ago was that?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Only a few minutes ago. She went to look for where security was light.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Light security... Thank you, Yomi-san.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> If she went to where there was little security, this should be a likely area...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Oh, Konohana-sa... Wow, that&#x27;s so pretty.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Hanahana, you look amazing in that wedding dress!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> I wish I could wear one too!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Fufu, thank you. Have you seen Maki-san around?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Makimaki was right here with us until a moment ago. I think she&#x27;s still nearby!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah! You want Shidou-san to see you in your wedding dress, don&#x27;t you!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> All I want is to perform our mission, which I need to find her for.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...Musumi-san? We mustn&#x27;t confuse our private interests with our duties.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I-I&#x27;m sorry.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Please focus your attention on securing the area, will you?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...Really now, it&#x27;s all because Musumi-san had to say something strange that I&#x27;m somewhat nervous again... Ah.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...! M-Maki-san?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Oh, Suzuka. Looks like you&#x27;re done getting changed.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Y-Yes.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> There&#x27;s been no sign of anything here. The spectrum finder hasn&#x27;t responded either, so it doesn&#x27;t seem like the aradama is around.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Suzuka?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Ah, it&#x27;s nothing... Its target must be the ring after all.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> That&#x27;s right, we should get it ready now.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yes.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> (Honestly, why did I expect anything more from Maki-san... I feel like a fool for ever getting nervous.)<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Suzuka?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I&#x27;ll have the ring ready in a moment. The other toji have taken their positions, so we can start...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> No, I didn&#x27;t mean that... You look good.<br>

Fufu, I&#x27;m glad to hear that, Maki-san.  </p><div class="videoWrapper"><iframe width="640" height="480" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MB7eNdGUsHU"></iframe></div><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="valentines-suzuka-start-a-similar-pair"></a>[Valentines Suzuka: Start]: A Similar Pair?<a class="hash-link" href="#valentines-suzuka-start-a-similar-pair" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Mirja:</strong> As of now, there is only one more confirmed target in the shopping mall. Do you see it on the spectrum finder?<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> ...Ggii.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> There it is.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> (Rather than giving chase now with the two of us, it would be more effective to form a pincer attack. If these aradama are truly after the chocolate, then it shouldn&#x27;t run to the other floors, but instead to the food court.)<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> (There is only one route it can take to there. Our strategy should be for Kitora Mirja to circle around, and--)<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I&#x27;ll circle around to the food court! Konohana Suzuka, you drive the aradama forward. As a precaution, I&#x27;ll contact Kohagura and Tsubakuro as I move.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> !<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Good, I won&#x27;t object to that.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Destroying them is most important, however--<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> ...GGGIII-!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> It won&#x27;t make it so easy, will it.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Though, even if you run, I&#x27;ll guide your every move.<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> GSHAA---!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Just as planned. It&#x27;s coming directly here.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> However, I won&#x27;t so lenient as to let such a mindless charge through!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Well done.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Bringing it down was nothing. You had the more difficult role of guiding it here.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> It might have been on the run, but that aradama would have only gone to where the chocolate is located, so it was hardly a challenge.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I see. Though, shouldn&#x27;t you have been able to bring that aradama down?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> There are many things left unconfirmed about these aradama, so I decided to rely on the more certain method of a pincer attack. If you hadn&#x27;t proposed the idea, I would have.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I realize we are operating in two man teams during this mission, but it&#x27;s been simple to carry out with how clear each other&#x27;s intentions are.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I felt the same. I can follow on your sensible instructions without hesitation. The elite guard must operate very smoothly.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I never give detailed instructions to the elite guard.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> The primary role of the elite guard is to escort Yukari-sama, so when carrying out large scale operations, I and Maki-san will take command of our own units.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Now that you mention it, that is certainly true. Hm...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> While we are on the topic of the elite guard, what sort of person is Shidou Maki? How do you see her?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Eh? W-What do... you mean by that...?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I have somewhat of an interest in Shidou Maki myself.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I&#x27;m not sure if you are aware, but in the tournament the year before last, I was defeated by her.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> As I see her, she is a straightforward toji with a single-minded strength. Every one of her strikes had great force behind it.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> However, as someone who is close at her side, I was wondering if you had a different impression.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Is that all you meant. Though, I don&#x27;t think my impression differs much from yours? There&#x27;s no hidden side to speak of when it comes to Maki-san.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Well, if I had to name something, she can be quite dense at times.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Is that so? She doesn&#x27;t at all give that impression when fighting.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Thank you for answering such a trivial question of mine.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> It was nothing. Now then, why don&#x27;t we make our way back.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="valentines-suzuka-end-the-reason-behind-her-enthusiasm"></a>[Valentines Suzuka: End]: The Reason Behind Her Enthusiasm<a class="hash-link" href="#valentines-suzuka-end-the-reason-behind-her-enthusiasm" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Patissier:</strong> Sure, that would be fine. I can teach you some relatively simple tricks to making delicious chocolate even at home.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Thank you very much. It won&#x27;t be an issue for you to teach them to me, will it?<br>
<strong>Patissier:</strong> Well, it shouldn&#x27;t be a problem so long as you don&#x27;t go spreading online that it was our shop that taught it to you.<br>
<strong>Patissier:</strong> We&#x27;re very grateful to all you toji. You&#x27;re spending your spare time helping us, aren&#x27;t you?<br>
<strong>Patissier:</strong> It&#x27;s probably because you&#x27;re all so cute, but we&#x27;re selling more chocolate this year than usual.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Well now. In that case, I&#x27;ll gladly learn what you have to teach me.<br>
<strong>Patissier:</strong> Then, we can do it after we close up for the day. But, you must be tired from your duties, so don&#x27;t push yourself, okay?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Of course; thank you for your concern.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> We&#x27;re back-! I had a pretty exciting experience, fighting with Yumecchi out there.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Really? I was just fighting like I normally do~.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> You were really leading the way with how we were fighting before. It seems like anyone would have a hard time keeping up with you.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ah, now that we&#x27;re here, I wanna eat some cake!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> That&#x27;s a good idea! I&#x27;m a little hungry myself.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> What should I have today~? Mont blanc? Or pudding a la mode... Mmm, I think I&#x27;ll go with the strawberry rare cheesecake after all~.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Strawberry is one of your favorites, isn&#x27;t it, Yume. You like Ichigo Daifuku Neko as well, don&#x27;t you?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Yeah, I guess it is~.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Once you&#x27;ve finished eating, can I count on you to help us with managing the shop?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I&#x27;ll go ahead and get changed first.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Sure sure-. You don&#x27;t have to worry about me-.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Thank you very much for your order. We hope to see you again.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Thank you very much~...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Suzuka-onee-san, is it me, or are you acting extra excited today?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the case? This is how I always am.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh, but I feel like something&#x27;s different for sure-. Ah, maybe you got a special kind of cake!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> If I had gotten a cake like that, I would have shared it with you, Yume.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Hmm, I guess you would&#x27;ve. Then maybe I imagined it? But still...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> (I should have expected no less from Yume... She&#x27;s so perceptive when it comes to the strangest things. I think it would be fine to tell her about being taught the tricks to making chocolate though.)<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> (But, until Valenties day, I cannot allow Maki-san to find out.)<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> (I&#x27;m only erring on the side of caution. Sorry, Yume.)<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> (I&#x27;m sure the store&#x27;s products would be more delicious, but I&#x27;m a bit interested in seeing Maki-san&#x27;s reaction when I tell the chocolates I gave her are homemade.)<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Though, it is Maki-san after all. I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;s no stranger to homemade chocolate.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> What&#x27;s that about Maki-onee-san?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Nothing at all. It isn&#x27;t much longer until closing time, so let&#x27;s give one last effort.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> You really are acting kinda suspicious today, Suzuka-onee-san~...  </p><div class="videoWrapper"><iframe width="640" height="480" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gTpQZtWj_rg"></iframe></div><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="xmas-19---suzuka-start-a-place-to-hide-a-present"></a>[Xmas&#x27; 19 - Suzuka: Start]: A Place to Hide a Present<a class="hash-link" href="#xmas-19---suzuka-start-a-place-to-hide-a-present" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Maki:</strong> Suzuka, did something happen for you to call me over here?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I&#x27;m sorry to do this when things are so busy at the end of the year. But actually, I&#x27;d like to discuss something with you.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Discuss what?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> It&#x27;s about the birthday present we bought for Yomi-san the other day.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Oh yeah. We picked out a great present thanks to you. I&#x27;m looking forward to surprising her with it. But, what about it?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> You see, I had hidden it in the back of the record room so that Yomi-san wouldn&#x27;t find it until the 24th...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Don&#x27;t tell me she found it!?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> No, I was able to retrieve it just in time, but Yomi-san&#x27; intuition is sharp. I&#x27;m not quite sure how to keep it a secret until the day of.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I get it. You&#x27;re right, that&#x27;s an important discussion to have.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> To begin with, anywhere we can enter, Yomi-san freely enters as well...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> And if we kept it in our living quarters, Yume would likely find it whenever she comes in to play around.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> In previous years, we prepared it together with Yume, so the three of us could have kept it a secret between us.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> But she went and said she&#x27;d do something on her own this year. I want to keep it secret from Yume too if possible...<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Konohana-san, you were in here?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Y-Yomi-san! Hadn&#x27;t you gone off on an assignment?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I was called in by Yukari-sama. I&#x27;m supposed to bring you with me as well.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yukari-sama asked for you and myself? Very well then. We can leave in a moment. Though...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I&#x27;ll take care of the present for now. If you think of a good place to store it, send me a message.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Alright then. Do your best to keep it a secret.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Konohana, Satsuki, the two of you will be undertaking a special mission.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I understand. Ask us to do whatever is needed.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes, whatever the mission entails, we will carry it out flawlessly.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Those are encouraging responses. Your mission is set to take place on December 25th.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Dressed in Santa Claus outfits, I want you to visit locations where the local children gather and distribute presents prepared by the Origami family.<br>
<strong>Suzuka/Yomi:</strong> Eh...?<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> What, are you dissatisfied with that?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Not at all; I think it&#x27;s a wonderful idea! Yukari-sama, thank you for offering us this lovely mission.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> So long as you order it, I&#x27;ll tend to it quickly, Yukari-sama.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> The presents have already been set aside in the storehouse. I leave it to you to decide how to distribute them. Is that clear?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yes ma&#x27;am!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> There&#x27;s a mountain of presents...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Would you look at that! Each of them is so neatly wrapped; just the sight of it gives me a thrill!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Does it...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> They&#x27;re all so cute, and yet you don&#x27;t seem interested in the slightest, Yomi-san...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Ahh! That&#x27;s right! I could try that!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Konohana-san? Is something wrong?<br>

<strong>Yomi:</strong> I&#x27;m sorry. I&#x27;m unused to working with children...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> There&#x27;s no helping that then. Yomi-san, I&#x27;ll give an example of what to do, so try mimicking me to start. Here I go.<br>

<strong>Children:</strong> Okaaay!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I see, bring yourself down to their level, and speak plainly to them... I&#x27;ll try it.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Everyone, if you want a present, please line up. Will everyone who wants a present please line up.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> All the presents were peacefully handed out. You did well, Yomi-san.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Are you feeling too tired to have much to say? Though, because of your efforts today, you brought happiness to plenty of children.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Do you think so?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I do. And that Santa bag you&#x27;re holding is the proof of it. Isn&#x27;t the inside filled with objects of their gratitude?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes; letters, drawings, candies, and chocolate. I never expected them to give me so many gifts in return.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> With this, we should be able to give a good report to Yukari-sama.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> That&#x27;s true.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> By the way, Konohana-san. You&#x27;ve been carefully holding onto one present for a while now. Did you forget to distribute it?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Our mission today was to deliver every last one of the presents. We should hurry and find a child to deliver it to.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> There won&#x27;t be any need for that. This here is Maki-san and my birthday present to you, Yomi-san.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> For... me?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> With all the confusion surrounding the party and our missions, we ended up a day late, but Yomi-san, we wish you a happy birthday.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Konohana-san...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Fufu, and I&#x27;ll take a photo of the moment of our successful surprise. Maki-san on her expedition assignment should be glad to see this.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Thank you for your gift. I&#x27;m grateful for your thoughtfulness.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> You&#x27;re very perceptive, Yomi-san, so we were anxious you might find your present before we could give it to you.<br>

<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yes, it will be a bit of a trip. It&#x27;s been some time since you and I took an assignment together, Maki-san.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> With both of us, it&#x27;d be extremely unlikely anything goes wrong, but... It hasn&#x27;t been long since we were put in the special defense team.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Let&#x27;s keep ourselves focused.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Of course.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Even seen favorably, the special defense team is simply a re-organizing of the old Origami family elite guard.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> There are still those keeping a harsh eye on us now, so all we can do is to continue producing results.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I don&#x27;t see any... responses to aradama.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Doesn&#x27;t seem like there&#x27;s any around here. If we had Yomi with us right about now...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> She would have found them easily.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yet...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Though we were re-assembled directly under Akane-sama... If the four of us were to be acting together, it would invite needless suspicion.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> We need to endure it for the time being.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> We can&#x27;t let pointless gossip make Yukari-sama&#x27;s situation worse than it already is.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ...I&#x27;m going to hang around here a little longer. What about you, Suzuka?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Let&#x27;s see... We should rest for the night.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Got it. You go on back first, Suzuka.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> No, you&#x27;ll be coming back with me, Maki-san.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> If you&#x27;re worried about me, don&#x27;t be. An aradama&#x27;s not going to get the better of me just because I lost one night of sleep.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I believe you. But, what if it&#x27;s two nights instead of one? What if we still haven&#x27;t found the aradama then?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Do you plan on keeping yourself awake all this time?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Then I&#x27;ll...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> It would be too much, even for you. Wouldn&#x27;t it, Maki-san?<br>

Your back is so warm.)  </p><div class="videoWrapper"><iframe width="640" height="480" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/se0e89SO9FY"></iframe></div><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="misogi---suzuka-start-someone-i-cant-take-my-mind-off-of"></a>[Misogi - Suzuka: Start]: Someone I Can&#x27;t Take My Mind Off Of<a class="hash-link" href="#misogi---suzuka-start-someone-i-cant-take-my-mind-off-of" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Yukari:</strong> Shidou, Konohana, I want the both of you to leave to conduct an inspection tomorrow.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Will you not be traveling with us, Yukari-sama?<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> That&#x27;s right; there&#x27;s other business I&#x27;ll have to attend to. I&#x27;d like for you two to handle this.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> The details will be sent to you later, but essentially...<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> The idea is to have two active duty toji give their perspective on plans made with the railway association to resolve issues dispatching toji to sites of aradama outbreaks.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Yes ma&#x27;am!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Understood.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Konohana, after accompanying me to several inspections, you should have an idea of what to do. Give Shidou your support.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Certainly.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I&#x27;ll be counting on you.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> (Yukari-sama said to support Maki-san, but, even without me, she likely would have been fine on her own.)<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> (Shidou Maki... Even before facing each other in the finals of the tournament, I was already aware of her. Being the owner of that okatana, Usumidori.)<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> (Usumidori has a deep connection to my Kurama-ryu... I had expected to inherit it myself one day. But, it never happened.)<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> (Ever since then, I think... I might have been conscious of her.)<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> (And-- then came the tournament where I&#x27;d been determined to prove my superiority over her. Only to be defeated in the end... What&#x27;s worse, it happened two years in a row.)<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ...zuka?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> (Even now, after following her into the elite guard, I can&#x27;t help but never want to be outdone by her.)<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Suzuka. Um... It&#x27;s awkward, with you staring at me not saying anything... If something&#x27;s bothering you, could you tell me?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...!? Ahem... I&#x27;m very sorry about that. I was just a bit lost in thought.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Oh.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> You really helped me out today. I&#x27;m glad you came along.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...Maki-san?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Suppressing aradama is one thing, but I still can&#x27;t get used to this inspection stuff.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Even when they go over it for me, I can&#x27;t come up with a lot more than, &quot;Ahh, so that&#x27;s how it is.&quot;<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Compared to me, you&#x27;re incredible.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Wh-Where is all this coming from?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Weren&#x27;t you asking all the right questions?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> If it had been just me, I wouldn&#x27;t have been able to come back with a report that&#x27;d make Yukari-sama happy.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...That&#x27;s the entire reason I was here. There&#x27;s no reason for you to be concerned about it.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> More importantly, what are you thinking, flaunting your weakness in front of me like that?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ...What do you mean?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I&#x27;m shocked is all. You used to be so stubborn, and yet you seem to have grown awfully open minded.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> You&#x27;re good with situations like those, right? Since you know how to look at things from different angles.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> All I was thinking all day was, I&#x27;m really glad someone as reliable as you is with me.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Wha...!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I still keep it in mind; how you told me it&#x27;d be better if we took on different roles that show the best of our abilities.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...If that&#x27;s all this is about, then that&#x27;s fine.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> (Maki-san has been like this ever since we agreed to start calling each other by our first names...)<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> (...It makes me seem strange for being the only one so wary around her...!)<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> (Really... Maki-san, you&#x27;re just so...)  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="misogi---suzuka-end-crossing-okatana-as-a-refresher"></a>[Misogi - Suzuka: End]: Crossing Okatana as a Refresher<a class="hash-link" href="#misogi---suzuka-end-crossing-okatana-as-a-refresher" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Maki-san. You&#x27;ve left a few errors in this paperwork, you know?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I did? Sorry; could I fix it up later? I&#x27;m running short on time.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> It&#x27;s not an issue. I&#x27;ve already corrected them for you.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Thanks for that. Anyway, I&#x27;d better get going.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Hey, hey, Suzuka-onee-san. Aren&#x27;t you kinda getting friendlier with Maki-onee-san now? You are, right?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Nothing&#x27;s changed between us in the slightest.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh; you&#x27;re definitely friendlier now!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> (She&#x27;s not wrong... It feels as if there&#x27;s less distance between Maki-san and myself...)<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> (But, even so... I still want to make up for the losses I suffered to her...)<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Sigh...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> (How can I relieve these pent up feelings... It seems I&#x27;ll have to do something to refresh myself.)<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> This is the first time we&#x27;ve fought seriously since the tournament, isn&#x27;t it?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Thank you very much for accepting my sudden proposal.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> It&#x27;s fine by me.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...This time, I&#x27;ll be victorious.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I&#x27;m not planning on losing either.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Good. There wouldn&#x27;t be much point if you were.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Then, let&#x27;s get started. Come at me whenever.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I&#x27;ll take you up on that then!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> EII--!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Ggh... You&#x27;re especially aggressive today.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I can&#x27;t have you thinking... I&#x27;ll only stay the same old Konohana Suzuka--!!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Having you come at me head on&#x27;s kind of exciting.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Don&#x27;t you think... you&#x27;re talking a little too much?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> You&#x27;re right; let&#x27;s leave it at that. Here I come.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> --YAAAAAAHH!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> (She really is... so strong! Her strikes so straightforward... so heavy!)<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> (Even still, I won&#x27;t lose!)<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> HAAAAAH!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> [pant... pant... pant...]<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I&#x27;m beaten... It&#x27;s your win.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> That was a great match. You really are amazing. You had me scrambling to keep up; I&#x27;ve never seen you fight like that before.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Let&#x27;s keep getting stronger like that together, to support Yukari-sama.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> (That attitude of hers-- As straightforward as her swordsmanship. Maybe that&#x27;s what Usumidori recognized in her.)<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> (This marks my third consecutive defeat. And yet...)<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Of course. But, someday, I will overtake you. ...I hope you won&#x27;t grow complacent, unless you&#x27;d like me to take your precious okatana off your hands.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I&#x27;m glad for the competition. I won&#x27;t be losing either; I&#x27;ll show you how strong I can get.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Take good care of Usumidori for me.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Course I will. That&#x27;s my trusty partner you&#x27;re talking about.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations/edit/docs/episodes/Konohana_Suzuka_Episodes.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_2_ui" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_3DPF"></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/tnm-translations/docs/episodes/Shidou_Maki_Episodes/"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Â« Shidou Maki Episodes</div></a></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/tnm-translations/docs/episodes/Satsuki_Yomi_Episodes/"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Next</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Satsuki Yomi Episodes Â»</div></a></div></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_35-E thin-scrollbar"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#1-dance-of-the-ojou-samas" class="table-of-contents__link">1: Dance of the Ojou-samas</a></li><li><a href="#2-the-ojou-sama-is-a-commoner" class="table-of-contents__link">2: The Ojou-sama is a Commoner</a></li><li><a href="#3-suzukas-duties" class="table-of-contents__link">3: Suzuka&#39;s Duties</a></li><li><a href="#4-the-time-we-spent-together" class="table-of-contents__link">4: The Time we Spent Together</a></li><li><a href="#5-the-one-at-your-side" class="table-of-contents__link">5: The One at Your Side</a></li><li><a href="#bride-19-start-undercover-investigation-suzukas-case" class="table-of-contents__link">Bride '19: Start: Undercover Investigation (Suzuka&#39;s Case)</a></li><li><a href="#bride-19-end-youre-late-you-know" class="table-of-contents__link">Bride '19: End: You&#39;re Late, You know?</a></li><li><a href="#valentines-suzuka-start-a-similar-pair" class="table-of-contents__link">Valentines Suzuka: Start: A Similar Pair?</a></li><li><a href="#valentines-suzuka-end-the-reason-behind-her-enthusiasm" class="table-of-contents__link">Valentines Suzuka: End: The Reason Behind Her Enthusiasm</a></li><li><a href="#xmas-19---suzuka-start-a-place-to-hide-a-present" class="table-of-contents__link">Xmas' 19 - Suzuka: Start: A Place to Hide a Present</a></li><li><a href="#xmas-19---suzuka-end-present-for-you" class="table-of-contents__link">Xmas' 19 - Suzuka: End: Present For You</a></li><li><a href="#special-defense-team---suzuka-start-suzuka-of-the-special-defense-team" class="table-of-contents__link">Special Defense Team - Suzuka: Start: Suzuka of the Special Defense Team</a></li><li><a href="#special-defense-team---suzuka-end-in-harmony" class="table-of-contents__link">Special Defense Team - Suzuka: End: In Harmony</a></li><li><a href="#misogi---suzuka-start-someone-i-cant-take-my-mind-off-of" class="table-of-contents__link">Misogi - Suzuka: Start: Someone I Can&#39;t Take My Mind Off Of</a></li><li><a href="#misogi---suzuka-end-crossing-okatana-as-a-refresher" class="table-of-contents__link">Misogi - Suzuka: End: Crossing Okatana as a Refresher</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Links</div><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://pastebin.com/LdyviZ8Z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Translator anon&#x27;s pastebin<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Site source code<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Built with Docusaurus.</div></div></div></footer></div>
