Hiyori-san! Morning! You&#x27;re looking as lovely as ever today!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> .........<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Huhh? Why are you glaring at me like that?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> I can&#x27;t stand that kind of empty flattery.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I&#x27;m not lying to you! I think you&#x27;re beautiful, Hiyori-san! I mean it!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> You go around telling that to everyone, don&#x27;t you.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> W-Well, I mean... That&#x27;s because every toji is good looking!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> And I have a disease that&#x27;ll kill me if I don&#x27;t compliment every girl I think is cute!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ......That&#x27;s some disease. Well, it doesn&#x27;t matter to me either way.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> You&#x27;re so cold to me, Hiyori-san!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> But you know, I kind of like it when you treat me like that!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...If you don&#x27;t have anything more to say, I&#x27;m going back to my room.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ehh-! Stay and talk with me for a while! I was thinking you and I could get closer--<br>
<strong>Academy Intercom:</strong> Aradama have been identified in the area of this academy. Toji, make preparations for emergency sortie. I repeat, aradama have been identified--<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Oh no, Hiyori-san! We should go together and help out!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> And on our way there, we can talk about all kinds of things and deepen our bond with each other!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...Third layer jin&#x27;i!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Hey!? Hiyori-san-!? Please don&#x27;t leave me behind!! Is that how badly you don&#x27;t want to talk to me!?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Phew... Looks like that&#x27;s mission complete!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Hiyori-saaaan~, I was so lonely~. Why did you run away and leave me all by myself on the way here~?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...Oh, you were here too?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> You didn&#x27;t even recognize me!?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Hey, Hiyori-chan! Even if you&#x27;re joking, you can&#x27;t be that rude!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Uuuu, not just cute, but kind on top of that. You&#x27;re my angel, Kanami-chan...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Eh-? U-Uh, thanks...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Anyway, since we worked up a sweat here, why don&#x27;t we head for the baths! You&#x27;ve gotta come with us, Hiyori-san!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...I know you have an ulterior motive, so I&#x27;m not going anywhere with you.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> What&#x27;s wrong with you, Hiyori-chan! Yui-chan just wants to hang out together; she doesn&#x27;t have any ulterior motive!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> --Uh, yes I do?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I mean, for me, taking a bath together after a mission is the best part about being a toji.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> ...Huh? What do you mean...? Wait, then what&#x27;s your ulterior motive...?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Kanami. In this world, there exist perverts beyond human understanding. This is one of them.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> That&#x27;s me, the pervert beyond human understanding~! Nice to meet you!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Wh-Why do you look so happy being called a pervert...? I don&#x27;t get it...  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="2-yuis-little-sister"></a>2: Yui&#x27;s Little Sister<a class="hash-link" href="#2-yuis-little-sister" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Ellen:</strong> Ah-! Yuiyui! I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d run into you here!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ellen-san! You&#x27;re looking good again today!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Oh! Thank you so much!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> I&#x27;m meeting Kaoru to get some parfaits from the coffee shop by the station. Do you want to join us, Yuiyui?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ahh, sorry... I really want to go with you two, but my wallet&#x27;s running tight this month...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Your wallet...?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> You are getting your salary, right? Since us toji are civil servants, after all.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Or did you spend it all on something big this month; is that what you mean?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> No... I get my salary, but it&#x27;s not like that...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> ? Do you have some kind of special circumstances?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> .........I-I do...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> --Oh, sorry about that. If you don&#x27;t want to talk about it, I don&#x27;t want you to feel forced to.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> ...No, I don&#x27;t want to have to hide this from you, so I&#x27;ll tell you about it, Ellen-san.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> To tell the truth... My little sister has a serious illness, and the medical bills are really high...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> So... Um...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> It&#x27;s hard getting by on just what my parents make, so whatever I get from my salary is gone right away too...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Sorry, you probably didn&#x27;t expect me to bring up something so serious, did you...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> I had no idea...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> It&#x27;s my fault for prying into it. I&#x27;m sorry about that.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Don&#x27;t blame yourself. You didn&#x27;t do anything wrong.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> ...That settles it! In that case, forget about the coffee!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> We&#x27;ll go to my room instead, and we can all hang out and talk!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> I don&#x27;t have a lot to offer, but I can make you some tea and sweets!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ehh-!? You don&#x27;t have to go that far; I&#x27;d feel bad if you changed your plans because of me.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Don&#x27;t worry about a thing! I didn&#x27;t know your sister was sick!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> But I think it&#x27;s incredible the way you&#x27;re already helping to support your family, Yuiyui!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> And also, I&#x27;m really glad you felt like sharing that with me!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> So I want to know more and more about you, so we can get even closer!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ellen-san... Thanks a lot!!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I want to get a lot closer with you too, Ellen-san!!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="3-yuis-grades"></a>3: Yui&#x27;s Grades<a class="hash-link" href="#3-yuis-grades" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Mirja:</strong> Final exams will be starting soon. Asakura Mihono, have you been preparing yourself?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Mirja-san... I&#x27;ve been thinking. I&#x27;ve been working hard as a toji, so I shouldn&#x27;t really have to study, right?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> We carry the duties of both a civil servant and a student, so neglecting your studies is out of the question.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Uuuuuuuu... I thought I could get you on my side if I tried to pass it off as seriously asking for advice, but it&#x27;s no use...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> By the way, what kind of grades do you get, Yui?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> My grades? Aside from math, they&#x27;re catastrophically bad!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Really-! Thank goodness-! We&#x27;re in this together-!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I don&#x27;t know that that&#x27;s something to be happy about...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> But hey, why are you only good at math then?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Mmm, well, I use math all the time doing everyday things, so I guess I just picked it up naturally?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Back when I was in elementary school, I liked finding the discount stickers they use in supermarkets. I&#x27;d do the math for the prices in my head, and I just got better and better at it.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Really? I like finding discounted stuff too, but I just bring them to the checkout without figuring out the price.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Math is useful, and it can really make life easier!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> For example, if you&#x27;re at a festival stall and they ask if you want to try the raffle, you can judge the price against the theoretical value of the prizes left over and decide if you should draw or not!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Th-Theoretical...?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> To put it simply, it means calculating how much you stand to gain before deciding whether you should gamble.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Are you good at math too, Mirja-san?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I am. I like to think all the scientific subjects are my forte.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> You mean it!? If you&#x27;re good at math too, it must really have been fate that brought us together!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I saw Mirja&#x27;s test results before, and it&#x27;s not just math. She gets good grades in every science subject...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> That doesn&#x27;t change the fact that she&#x27;s good at math though! The minor details don&#x27;t matter here!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Let&#x27;s cut right to the chase, Mirja-san! Why don&#x27;t you come back to my room, and we can passionately talk about math alone together!?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I have the feeling I&#x27;m in danger, so I refuse.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Th-This can&#x27;t be happening... I managed to ruin my big chance because of the way I&#x27;m always acting...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Yui-chan... So you know how bad you act, huh...  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="4-protective-handkerchief"></a>4: Protective Handkerchief<a class="hash-link" href="#4-protective-handkerchief" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Mai:</strong> I&#x27;ve thought this for a while, but that handkerchief with the little chicks on it you always have on your arm is so cute, Yui-chan.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Thanks! Actually, my little sister, Miku, made it for me!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Wow, that&#x27;s so nice! The stitching is so well done...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ehehehe. Miku&#x27;s been in the hospital ever since she was little, but she&#x27;s really good at sewing~.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> She even left a message on it, &quot;Onee-chan, thank you for everything&quot;!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> You love your sister a lot, don&#x27;t you, Yui-chan. Whenever you talk about her, your eyes light up.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Of course! She&#x27;s my lovable little sister.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> ...Miku loves to study, so every time I go to her hospital room there&#x27;s always piles of thick books lying around.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Every one of them is just words words words, with no pictures anywhere. I give up on the first page whenever I try reading one.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> ...I only heard this from the nurses, but Miku&#x27;s dream is to someday be a schoolteacher.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Apparently, a few times a week, she gathers up the other kids who stay at the hospital like her and helps them with their studies.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> She sounds like such a good girl.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> And even though she&#x27;s been hospitalized since she was young, she has all kinds of dreams for the future.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> ...If her sickness gets better, she&#x27;ll study a lot, then get into a good college, and fulfill her dream of becoming a schoolteacher.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> And then she&#x27;ll meet someone nice, get married, and become a good mother.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> --But, her sickness is taking all of that away from her.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> It&#x27;s too unfair. Why&#x27;d that have to happen to such a good kid... If I could take her place, I would, but...<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ah... Sorry! You were only asking about my handkerchief, but then all I could think about was Miku.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> You know, I think aradama and illness are a lot alike. They both come out of nowhere, and they both take the futures from people who&#x27;ve done nothing wrong.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> That&#x27;s why I have to fight it!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I might not be able to make Miku better, but I can save people getting unfairly attacked by aradama!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> To tell the truth, sometimes when I run into a big aradama, I feel so scared I want to run away.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> But when that happens, I look at the handkerchief Miku gave me. And I imagine Miku with me, telling me to do what&#x27;s right!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Like, &quot;Onee-chan, help save those people from the pain of losing their future&quot;.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> And then, all the people getting attacked by aradama look like Miku to me. And for Miku&#x27;s sake, I&#x27;ll fight off any aradama!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> All my fears vanish, and when I swing my okatana, I feel like I could chop through every aradama in my way, like, URYAAAAA!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Really? So to you, that handkerchief is the ultimate protective charm.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I&#x27;m sure your sister is also feeling better, knowing how hard you&#x27;re working as a toji for her.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ehehe, I hope so!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="5-whats-always-in-my-bag"></a>5: What&#x27;s Always in My Bag<a class="hash-link" href="#5-whats-always-in-my-bag" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Ahh-!

<strong>Yui:</strong> I keep an ice pack in there too, so it&#x27;s nice and cold! Don&#x27;t worry!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You keep an ice pack in your bag!? Just for the tako wasabi!?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Hang on, it&#x27;s already evening. If you put that in there before we started practice, isn&#x27;t it all melted by now?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I feel like there&#x27;s bigger things to worry about than that, Kofuki-san...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> It&#x27;s fine! When we went back, I swapped it out for a new one!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Well, fine by me.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You&#x27;re okay with that...!?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> In the first place, why would you got that far to keep tako wasabi with you at all times...?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Do you really feel like you have to eat some that often...?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Nn? What&#x27;s weird about that? You keep gummies in your bag too, Kiyoka.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Right? It&#x27;s the same thing!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ehhhh...? Tako wasabi and gummies aren&#x27;t at all alike though...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> But they feel the same in your mouth, don&#x27;t they?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Even if they do, everything else is completely different, isn&#x27;t it...?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Anyway, Kofuki-san! Please try the tako wasabi I made!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You made it yourself!?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Why&#x27;s that surprise you? Mai gives out the cookies she makes all the time, doesn&#x27;t she?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> She does, but making tako wasabi is on a whole different level from baking cookies...!?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Uuu... When it comes to food, I can&#x27;t get through to these two at all... Hono-chan, Chie-san, Mirja-san, help me...<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> --Ohh. This stuff&#x27;s pretty good.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Isn&#x27;t it! Here, you have some too, Kiyoka-chan!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Open wide and say ahh-!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...I-I&#x27;ll just try one bite...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> (bite)<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...! It&#x27;s good! The octopus is fun to chew, and the wasabi gives it a nice flavor.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I always thought of tako wasabi as something adults eat when they&#x27;re drinking, but this is really tasty!!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> See-? Now do you get why I like to have tako wasabi with me when I&#x27;m out?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I do. Or at least, I can tell why you like it so much!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I&#x27;ve never really had it before, so I had no idea it tasted so good...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Fu fu fu. I&#x27;m happy to turn you into a tako wasabi fan too, Kiyoka-chan-!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> If you ever want some, come ask me anytime!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Okay, thanks for offering! Then... Could I have another bite?  </p><div class="videoWrapper"><iframe width="640" height="480" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a6wLA2_IHTA"></iframe></div>**New Year&#x27;s 1:** To Fulfill a Great Ambition **Yui:** ...Pant, pant... Not good, I can&#x27;t... I can&#x27;t die in a place like this... **Kofuki:** What? What are you even talking about. **Yui:** I&#x27;ve been waiting, Kofuki-san! I just know you&#x27;d look great in a kimono... **Yui:** Why aren&#x27;t you wearing a kimonooo!!? **Kofuki:** Cause putting one on&#x27;s too annoying. **Yui:** But I&#x27;ve been waiting so long for this... I was getting so excited I was on the brink of death...! **Mihono:** I&#x27;m done-! Yui, Fukki-! **Yui:** I waited, Mihono-chan! You look way too cute in that! **Mihono:** Ehehe, thanks. Chii-nee helped put it on me. **Chie:** Really, stop running around, Mihono-chan. What will you do if it starts coming loose? **Mihono:** Ahh, oh yeah! Sorry, Chii-nee! **Mirja:** I think it would be best if you remembered how to put it on yourself, so you can fix it if that happens. **Mihono:** I-I can try, but... I&#x27;m not sure I can remember... **Yui:** ...... **Mirja:** What is it, Yamashiro Yui? **Yui:** Bravo-! Bravo, everyone! Could anyone else out there wear a kimono so well, nay, they couldn&#x27;t! **Yui:** ...Wait, hold on? Where&#x27;s Kiyoka-chan? **Kofuki:** She&#x27;s still getting changed. She said she can&#x27;t get it to fit right or something. **Mihono:** She was still like that when we were done changing too. **Chie:** That&#x27;s true. She said she might need a little more time. **Yui:** Hmm... So that means, Kiyoka-chan&#x27;s still getting dressed all alone right now... **Mirja:** That&#x27;s how it is. **Yui:** Guhe, guhehe. My big chance has arrived. It&#x27;s time to make my dream come true! **Mihono:** Your dream? **Yui:** Yes, my dream! The humble Yamashiro Yui will go help Kiyoka-chan as she&#x27;s getting changed! **Mihono:** Kiyoka and Yui are pretty close, huh. Maybe I should go help her too. **Kofuki:** She&#x27;s not a little kid. One person&#x27;s enough. **Chie:** But still, is it really alright letting her go? **Yui:** KI-YO-KA-CHWAAAN-!　I&#x27;M- HERE- TO- HELP-, WITH YOUR KIMONO! **Kiyoka:** GYAAAAAAAAAAAA!! **New Year&#x27;s 2:** It&#x27;s Fine, Isn&#x27;t It! [This needs a TL note. In period dramas, there&#x27;s a cliched scene where the evil governor will tug the sash of a woman in a kimono, causing her to spin around as she comes undressed. You&#x27;ve probably seen something like it, but Yui is doing the whole act and really hamming it up.]<p><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Yui-chan, why are you here....<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ｉ’ｍ　ｈｅｒｅ, 　ｔｏ　ｈｅｌｐ　ｙｏｕ，　ｇｅｔ　ｃｈａｎｇｅｄ－！<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Why are you talking so weird!?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Huff-! Huff-!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> A-Aren&#x27;t you breathing a little heavy...?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> That&#x27;s just my excitement escaping through my mouth!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Eek... Y-You&#x27;re eyes are so bloodshot too... Aren&#x27;t they?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> That&#x27;s just my excitement spilling out of my eyes!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Either way, you&#x27;re leaking!?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Thank you, kami-sama... No, GOD! Thank you, God! After all these years, today, you&#x27;ve made my dream come true!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Your dream? I-I don&#x27;t really understand, but... A-As you can see, I&#x27;m getting dressed now, okay?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> And that&#x27;s why I came!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Eeh!?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> It&#x27;s okay, right, Kiyoka-chan? Since you&#x27;re getting changed, it&#x27;s okay, right...?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I-I don&#x27;t know what you mean, but it&#x27;s not okay! I know whatever you&#x27;re going to do, I&#x27;m not at all okay with!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> It&#x27;s fine, isn&#x27;t it, it&#x27;s fine!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> What is!?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Kiyoka-chan, I, Yamashiro Yui, have a dream. A dreaaam to play governor with a cute girl...!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I didn&#x27;t want to know!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Tugging on a cute girl&#x27;s obi! Their sweet scent spreading as they spin! And she&#x27;s left in an immodest state!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Playing governor is, GOD! Now then... Here we go!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> D-Don&#x27;t... HYAAAAAAAAAA-!!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I&#x27;d like it if you&#x27;d shout &quot;Ohhh myyyy~!&quot; instead!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Pant, pant... Th-That&#x27;s just, too much...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ahh, the way you&#x27;re lying there, trying to cover your chest... Good!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Nothing about this is good...<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Oiii, are you done changing yet-? Wait, what are you getting naked for?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Kofuki-san!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Eh, you aren&#x27;t finished changing yet? Hang on, I&#x27;ll call Chii-nee over!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...I-I&#x27;m saved.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I wanted to keep playing a little longer, but I had my fun!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Kiyoka-chan, I&#x27;ll help you get dressed too, okay!<br>

<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Just the two of us, Yamashiro-san?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> You&#x27;re fine with it just being you and me!? You&#x27;re so adventurous, Tsugumi-san-!!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I am not. Besides, wouldn&#x27;t it be boring going to the pool with someone like myself?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Seriously-! I don&#x27;t get it; how could a date at the pool all alone with a cute girl ever be boring?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> It&#x27;s impossible to predict what will set you off, Yamashiro-san.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> ...Will anyone else be coming?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Uhh, as far as I&#x27;ve heard, there&#x27;s Kanami-chan, Mai-chan, Mihono-chan, Kiyoka-chan...<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> ...That&#x27;s enough. I get the gist of it now.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> So anyway, come to the pool with us! Or, is there some research you have to do?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> No, on Sunday, I&#x27;ll be available.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Hooray-! Be sure to get an extra cute swimsuit ready for it, okay-!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> What kind of swimsuit did you buy, Tsugumi-san?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Just an ordinary one.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Did you really get a swimsuit just for this!? I&#x27;m so glad to hear it!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> There&#x27;s nothing wrong with having a swimsuit handy.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> How much swimming do you plan on doing, Yamashiro-san?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> You think we&#x27;re going swimming!?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> No wait, since we&#x27;re going to the pool together, we should have fun with each other!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> But, isn&#x27;t the purpose of a pool facility to let you swim?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> That&#x27;s what school pools are for. But we&#x27;re here to enjoy the pool today!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Enjoy it? ...I see, that is another way of looking at it.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> That&#x27;s right! And to that end, I, Yamashiro Yui! Have studied the pool to perfection!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> What I recommend trying at this pool we&#x27;re going to is the floating island attraction, Tsugumi-san!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> The &quot;floating island attraction&quot;?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> That&#x27;s right! It&#x27;s an attraction featuring floating platforms in the pool that you try to cross over while dodging obstacles!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> They have water slides and stuff too, but that sounded like the most fun to me!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> So you should look forward to it, okay?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> It does sound like fun, doesn&#x27;t it-.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Of course it does! I was getting so excited about it last night that I could barely sleep.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> From the sound of things, Kanami-chan and Mai-chan got there ahead of us, so we should race on over there too!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I just can&#x27;t calm down anymore~. The pool is seriously like visiting heaven!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="swimsuit-19-end-this-is-what-i-wanted-to-do"></a>[Swimsuit 19: End]: This is What I Wanted to Do!<a class="hash-link" href="#swimsuit-19-end-this-is-what-i-wanted-to-do" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Yui:</strong> We&#x27;ve arrived at the floating island attraction! I will now explain the rules!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> The rules?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> The difficulty of this attraction is designed for normal people, but we&#x27;re toji!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> That&#x27;s why; don&#x27;t you think we ought to make it more challenging?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> You have a point. If it&#x27;s too easy, it won&#x27;t be very fun.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I knew you&#x27;d understand, Mai-chan!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> How exactly do you plan on making it more challenging though?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Are we going to cross it while doing a handstand?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> A handstand!?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Going upside down in swimsuits on the floating islands... Everybody&#x27;s bodies wobbling around... Tsugumi-san, are you a genius...?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Hang on, wouldn&#x27;t doing a handstand on it be dangerous? We have to set a good moral standard.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ugh... If that&#x27;s what your conscience as a toji says, then we&#x27;ll just have to go along...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> So, like I originally planned, we&#x27;ll cross the floating islands in pairs while holding each other&#x27;s hands!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> We have to hold hands... That sounds like it would really restrict our movements.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Not to mention, if one person lost their balance, it would be easy for both to fall in.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> That should make for a nice adjustment to the difficulty, Yamashiro-san.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Sure it does; I racked my brain coming up with it. Tsugumi-san, you and I should be the first pair to go!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> ...This takes an even greater sense of balance than I realized... Whoops.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Watch out, Tsugumi-san! Come and lean your body into me!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Thanks for supporting me, Yamashiro-san.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I should be the one thanking you hereee.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> (The perfectly legitimate reason I invented to press up against girls on the floating islands is a huge success!)<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> (Ahh, this is bad. I&#x27;m enjoying this so much it hurts! I wish time could stop here forever!)<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Uhehe, uheheheheh!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> What&#x27;s the matter, Yamashiro-san?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Nothing at all, just that the wonderfulness of the pool is getting to mee.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> True, I&#x27;m having a better time than I thought I would.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> ...Yamashiro-san, thank you for asking me to come with you.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Tsugumi-san smiled...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> (Wait? The mood here... If I confessed to her right now, doesn&#x27;t it seem like she&#x27;d accept?)<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Tsugumi-san, I-- PHWAGH!?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> The water hoses have started up.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Did you really have to give me a cold shower nowwwwww!?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Yamashiro-san!? You&#x27;ll slip on the wet platform, moving like that...<br>
<strong>Yui/Tsugumi:</strong> KYAAAAAAA!?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> We failed, didn&#x27;t we...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> But, I still had a lot of fun.

<strong>Itsuki:</strong> Yes... A little bit.<br>
<strong>Itsuki:</strong> Up until now, whenever I fought aradama, it was with a lot more people, so this is my first time with just one other person...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> You don&#x27;t have to worry about a thing, Itsuki-chan. I might not look like it, but I&#x27;m super strong!<br>

<strong>Itsuki:</strong> Okay, I&#x27;ll be in your care.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> -!!<br>

<strong>Yui:</strong> (This is different from what I feel with everyone in the investigation team... Could this be, my motherly instincts!?)<br>
<strong>Itsuki:</strong> Yui-san?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> It&#x27;s nothing at all, nothing at all.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> [inhale]... [exhale]... Okay! While we&#x27;re moving around together, you can feel free to think of me as your big sister!<br>
<strong>Itsuki:</strong> You&#x27;ll be my big sister, Yui-san?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I might not look like it, but I have a real little sister, which makes me a real big sister.<br>
<strong>Itsuki:</strong> If she has a big sister like you, your little sister must be having fun every day.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Itsuki-chan... I love you!<br>
<strong>Itsuki:</strong> Thank you.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I want to be the best big sister I can be, so you don&#x27;t know how happy it makes me to hear that.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> That reminds me, what&#x27;s Fuu-san usually like? As a fellow big sister, I&#x27;m a little curious.<br>
<strong>Itsuki:</strong> What&#x27;s Onee-chan like? Onee-chan, she&#x27;s... She&#x27;s like that.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Doesn&#x27;t change at all, huh...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> If she came to a different world and she&#x27;s still acting the same as always, that&#x27;s amazing.<br>

<strong>Itsuki:</strong> I-I&#x27;m alright! More importantly... Can ask you to handle things here for a minute?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Sure, but... Do you have some kind of plan?<br>
<strong>Itsuki:</strong> I was thinking of setting up a trap. It might not go that well though...<br>

<strong>Yui:</strong> No matter how small it is, any injury on a cute girl is life-threatening! Let me see it!<br>
<strong>Itsuki:</strong> O-Okay.<br>
<strong>Itsuki:</strong> ...I didn&#x27;t want to make you worry. I&#x27;m sorry.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> You might not think it, but I&#x27;m pretty sharp when it comes to things like these. Since my little sister has a bit of an illness.<br>
<strong>Itsuki:</strong> I hope she gets better soon then.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> ...Thanks. I&#x27;d like to be able to go on trips and stuff with her someday.<br>
<strong>Itsuki:</strong> You love your little sister, don&#x27;t you.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Yeah. I bet I love her just as much as Fuu-san loves you-.<br>
<strong>Itsuki:</strong> In that case, your little sister must love you even more than that.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Eh-, why do you think that-? I love her more for sure!<br>
<strong>Itsuki:</strong> Because... There&#x27;s no such thing as a little sister who doesn&#x27;t love their big sister! I&#x27;m absolutely positive she love love loves you!<br>

That&#x27;s all I need from you for today.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Wait, are you sure?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Yes. I need to set some aside for Shichinosato-san, after all.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Tsugumi-san, the way you look out for Kofuki-san... It&#x27;s so precious I can&#x27;t get enough!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Only you could describe aradama management as precious, Yamashiro-san.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> The reason I do this is because, if there are no aradama around, Shichinosato-san starts to get cranky.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Oh come onnn, isn&#x27;t that what makes it so precious~? Or, are you saying you get it?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Hmm, I can just never tell how you&#x27;ll respond to anything.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> There&#x27;s many types of people among the investigation team that I&#x27;m unused to dealing with, but... Yamashiro-san, you&#x27;re the most extreme of them all.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Socializing is hardly my strong suit, but there&#x27;s no one I&#x27;ve ever had as much trouble understanding as you.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> That sounds like an incredible appraisal of me, doesn&#x27;t it!?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> If that&#x27;s how you feel, then please go ahead and learn more about me! Read me like an open book; I&#x27;ll answer any question you ask!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Ah... Then, I have one question. I realize it&#x27;s a little late to ask, but, why are you helping with my research?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Putting it bluntly, I&#x27;m doing it for the money.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I get to be together with a real beauty, and I get paid to do it. Working as a toji is seriously the best job there is!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Your expression was different before and after you said that... Was there something about it you found hard to tell me?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ahaha, not at all; I love a girl who&#x27;s perceptive like that.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> ...My little sister, she&#x27;s sick. That&#x27;s why I need as much money as I can get.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> But, don&#x27;t you think a reason like that&#x27;s sort of too heavy to bring up? I mean, when you&#x27;re fooling around with girls, it&#x27;s best to keep things a little lighthearted and all!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> She&#x27;s sick?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ahaha, I shouldn&#x27;t have told you all that. Please just forget it.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> No, it&#x27;s good that I was able to see a new side of you.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> And also, Yamashiro-san. The experiments you&#x27;re assisting us with... Their results might one day be linked to a cure for your little sister.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Will they really!?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Speaking confidentially... Research is progressing on whether or not noro can be used to cure diseases.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> In fact, there have been rumors of a successful test case...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> This research can... But, how does it work?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> It&#x27;s only a rumor, so I&#x27;m not very clear on the details. At most, it should still only be at the fundamental research stage.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> But still! It&#x27;s possible that it could save my sister... It might be able to save Miku, wouldn&#x27;t it?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> ...Hearing something like that, there&#x27;s no way I can sit still about it!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Then... You might want to go and ask the elite guard about it.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> The elite guard?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Yukari-sama herself is involved with this research, so the people in the elite guard may know something more.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Though, it&#x27;s considered top secret, so I&#x27;m not sure if they will tell you...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> That&#x27;s enough for me! I&#x27;m going now!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> The elite guard...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I guess I&#x27;ll ask Suzuka-san, since she&#x27;s from Ayanokouji Martial Arts School too.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="misogi---yui-end-things-are-best-the-way-they-are"></a>[Misogi - Yui: End]: Things Are Best the Way They Are!<a class="hash-link" href="#misogi---yui-end-things-are-best-the-way-they-are" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Yui:</strong> Hello! Is Suzuka-san home at the moment!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...This isn&#x27;t my home, I&#x27;ll have you know. Was there something you needed?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Actually, there&#x27;s something I wanted to talk to you about...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> If it&#x27;s a love confession, I&#x27;ll refrain from hearing it.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> You mean, somebody leaked my private information about how I love Suzuka-san!?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Well now, was that actually true?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ahh, so you were just kidding with me. Here I was getting rejected before I even asked you out.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Don&#x27;t you think it&#x27;s your conduct that causes you to be treated this way? So? What was it you really came to see me about?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> ...Do you think we could talk about this someplace else?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> It seems this is a rather serious conversation. ...Come with me.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> You won&#x27;t have to worry about us being overheard in here.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Thank you very much! To tell the truth... I heard there were experiments in treating people&#x27;s illnesses with noro, and I wanted to ask you if, maybe you knew anything about it... Or something.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> --!? Where did you hear about... No. More importantly, why do you want to know?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Actually... Umm, this is kind of hard for me to say, but...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...It&#x27;s about your sister, isn&#x27;t it.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> You know about her?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> It&#x27;s only natural we would gather that much information. You haven&#x27;t spoken to anyone else about this... Have you?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> N-No! As soon as I heard about it, I came right here...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> In that case, forget all about it.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> ...! B-But, they&#x27;re researching it, aren&#x27;t they!?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> When you have no way of knowing how long it will take before that research can be used for practical purposes, there&#x27;s no point in placing your hopes on it, is there?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Your sister is desperately fighting to overcome her illness with modern medical care, and should be gradually getting better.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> If you have any time at all to spare speaking about this with me, you should spend it visiting her instead.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> And, you can forget all about that research. I&#x27;m sure that... Even if that method could make her better, you would only come to regret it.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> (...What Suzuka-san said is right. But, still...)<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> (If it can make her better, no matter what method it takes, I just want her to be healthy again...)<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Yamashiro Yui!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Eh?<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> KEEHHHHHH!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Uwah!?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> HAAAAAH!!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Th-Thanks for that...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> ...You aren&#x27;t acting like your usual self, Yamashiro Yui.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> What is it you&#x27;re brooding over? Isn&#x27;t your cheeriness your greatest asset?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> ...I&#x27;m sorry.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> If something is bothering you, why not speak about it? Telling someone else may lead to you finding the means to resolve it.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Then... I heard they&#x27;re researching a new kind of treatment that might cure my sister. But, someone who knows a lot about that treatment told me I shouldn&#x27;t place my faith in it...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> It&#x27;s true that they say progress in the field of medical research is fierce going. However... Is that the only method that can cure your sister?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> No... It&#x27;s going bit by bit, but she really is getting better now.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Is that research something that will soon be available for use?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Umm... I think they said, it was still at the stage of fundamental research?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Then, that well informed person was right in what they said. You can&#x27;t be certain of when a medical treatment still in the stage of fundamental research will be made available.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> This is only in regards to new forms of medicine, but... I&#x27;ve heard new medicines can take over a decade of research before they are made for general use.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> It can take that long!?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> (If that&#x27;s true, then... Going the slow and steady way might actually be faster...)<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> (I can&#x27;t be getting all torn up over it now; I&#x27;ve got to keep going at it the best I can, for Miku&#x27;s sake!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Thanks a lot, Mirja-san! I&#x27;m past it now!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> The girls of the investigation team really are the best there is!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> ...A crying child will soon be laughing, I suppose. Well, if you&#x27;ve recovered your spirit, then let&#x27;s leave it at that.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Right! Yamashiro Yui&#x27;s going at it in full spirit for another day!  </p><div class="videoWrapper"><iframe width="640" height="480" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wuef7y1z6Q4"></iframe></div><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="china---yui-start-the-chinatown-date-ive-longed-for"></a>[China - Yui: Start]: The Chinatown Date I&#x27;ve Longed For!?<a class="hash-link" href="#china---yui-start-the-chinatown-date-ive-longed-for" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> We&#x27;ve safely eliminated the aradama, so while we&#x27;re here, why don&#x27;t we take a stroll around Chinatown until the sun starts setting?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I&#x27;m all for it~! There&#x27;s still a lot more shops I haven&#x27;t been to yet. Do you two wanna come with me?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Of course I do!　It&#x27;s a Chinatown date with two good looking girls at my side! This makes fighting off those aradama all worth it~.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Date~! Date~! Chinatown date~!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> You&#x27;re sure in a good mood, Yui.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> You know I am! Taking a beauty like you on a date through Chinatown; that&#x27;s the kind of classic date course I&#x27;ve been dreaming of!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Hm? What&#x27;s up, Tsugumi-san? Ah-- Don&#x27;t tell me, you&#x27;re getting jealous I&#x27;m giving Mihono-chan all the attention?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> No, not once this whole time have I ever felt anything like that...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Then, what&#x27;s that uneasy look on your face for?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Sorry, it might be senseless of me to ask, but... I was just wondering, what is the definition of a &quot;date&quot; to begin with?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Tsugumi-san, you&#x27;re such a serious going girl. When it comes to things like this, it&#x27;s all about &quot;Don&#x27;t think; feel!&quot;<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Go with your feelings without thinking... Is that it. Then, coming up with feelings regarding dating... How exactly do you do that?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> That&#x27;s easy! Right now, I&#x27;ll swap between taking you and Mihono-chan on a Chinatown date with me, to give you the dating experience!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> The dating experience?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Yeah! I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time mentally rehearsing for the ultimate heart-pounding Chinatown date, so I&#x27;ll show you a good time for sure!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> If you&#x27;re that sure then, Yamashiro-san... It might not be so bad to get an experience of the real thing.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> That&#x27;s the spirit! So then, to start us off... I think I&#x27;ll take out Mihono-chan!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ehh-- Starting with me!? If you just tell me we&#x27;re going on a date like that, I don&#x27;t have time to get my heart ready...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Don&#x27;t you worry about that, Honey. I&#x27;ll escort you around just right. Why don&#x27;t we find somewhere to get some delicious sweets first?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> This place sells the apricot seed soft serve that&#x27;s the talk of Chinatown! I don&#x27;t have much pocket money on me today, so let&#x27;s share one between us. Here, open wide.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ahhn. [chew chew]... It&#x27;s yummy-!!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Alright, now it&#x27;s your turn, Mihono-chan! I&#x27;ll say &quot;ahh&quot;, and you...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah, look, look! In that general store next door! They&#x27;ve got cute panda things you can wear!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ah, wait, Mihono-chaaan!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Tadahhh! Check it out! See this panda hat I got! Does it look good?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Mmm~! It&#x27;s good; so good~! Next up, let&#x27;s try this Chinese hat~! Uwah~! This one looks good too~.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Um, would it be alright if we stopped for a moment?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Hmmm? What&#x27;s the matter, Tsugumi-san? Hahahn~, now are you feeling jealous of me with Mihono-chan...<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> That&#x27;s not it. It&#x27;s just that, I&#x27;ve started to have my doubts about all this. Eating sweets together, and excitedly shopping. It&#x27;s true that it does seem like you two are having lots of fun, but...<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> It also seems as if nothing has changed from when the three of us were going around together before. Can you really call this an example of a date...?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> You&#x27;re right. It was a lot of fun, but if I had to say either way, this isn&#x27;t any different from everyone hanging out together, is it-?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Yamashiro-san, is it really fine to classify this under the definition of a date?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Uuu~, when you put it like that, I&#x27;m losing confidence. Could I have a little time to think this over?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Get ahold of yourself, Yui. Remember the strongest Chinatown fantasy date plan you fantasized about over and over day after day. Chinatown... Chinatown... When I think of an ideal date in Chinatown, it&#x27;s gotta be...  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="china---yui-end-a-practice-run-yuis-fantasy-chinatown-date"></a>[China - Yui: End]: A Practice Run!?

Chinatown date... When I think of situations for the Chinatown date I&#x27;ve been dreaming of, there&#x27;s...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> That&#x27;ll do~!!!!!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> You look like a lightbulb went off in your head, Yui.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> She does. And, it&#x27;s somewhat unsettling...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Anyway, let&#x27;s get back into it, and swap partners! I&#x27;ll need you to be play my girlfriend now, Tsugumi-san!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> (Sigh, of course it would come to this. Though, I was the one who asked what a date was to start, so I can&#x27;t back out now, can I...)<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Understood. Then, please go easy on me.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Just leave that to me! Anyway, let&#x27;s start right off by holding hands! [squeeze~]. Woww, Tsugumi-san, your hands are so soft and warm~!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Y-Yamashiro-san! What are you doing? You got too close all of a sudden!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> See, I remembered. When you think of a date, it means the two of you are closer than friends! That means, the two of us need to have a closeness deeper than friendship.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Deeper than friendship... Is that so.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> That&#x27;s right! For example, if, while everyone&#x27;s watching, I gave you a deep kiss!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> And then, and then, if I took you someplace where no one&#x27;s around, like a park or back alley, and when it&#x27;s just the two of us, we... Ehehe... Ehehe...<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I-Is that what it means...  I think I understand the gist of it now, so don&#x27;t you think we can end our fake date here?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Y-Yeah. I think so too... The sun&#x27;s going to go down soon too, so why don&#x27;t we head home for today...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ehh-, just hang on! We were only just getting started-!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Uuuu... Just when it was looking like we were going to get into the juicy stuff; I&#x27;m such an idiot! I should have way more stuff in my stock of fantasies that&#x27;ll make girl&#x27;s hearts pound-!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ah-! I know! I have the strongest Chinatown date plan in history here! Hey, you two-, wait for me-!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I thought up the strongest Chinatown date plan! So please! Will you at least hear me walk you through it? If this doesn&#x27;t make your hearts throb, then I&#x27;ll take this as my loss!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> We weren&#x27;t competing to see if you won or lost in the first place... But, if you&#x27;re that adamant about it, we can at least hear you out.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah. It&#x27;s fine if you&#x27;re only going to talk... And plus, I&#x27;m a little curious what the strongest date plan is like!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Thanks so much, you two! It&#x27;s that kind side of you that I love so much! Anyway, I&#x27;ll get right to my presentation!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Our date starts off at a China dress shop in Chinatown! We put on matching dresses, and head out on the town!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Matching China dresses... We&#x27;re sticking to the assumption that this is a same sex female couple then...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Still, this sounds exciting! You&#x27;d be happy to wear a cute dress, wouldn&#x27;t you!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Right? So then, we eat some tasty food in Chinatown, and have a good time going around to all the cute general stores...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> That&#x27;d be fun~! But...<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Things have gone back to playing out exactly the same as before, haven&#x27;t they...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Hold your horses-! The main event starts right here!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> While the two of us are having a good time on our date, a group of burly thugs shows up and surrounds us, then tells you this:<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> &quot;Hey, pretty little thing, want to come have a good time with us...&quot;<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> That&#x27;s when the thugs try to take you away by force. But then, I shout, &quot;Get your hands off my girlfriend-!&quot; and give the guys a high kick while I&#x27;m still in my China dress!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> To protect the girl I love, I start pumping out stylish moves, taking down the punks one after another. And, completely captivated by me, my girlfriend says:<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> &quot;Thank you! I owe you my life. To make it up to you... You. Can. Have. Me...&quot;<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Kyaa-! Y&#x27;know, you&#x27;re a lot bolder than I thought... But, what kind of woman turns down a woman&#x27;s advances! Now&#x27;s not the time to hold ourselves back! And then, the two of us spend our sweet time together... Eheheheh...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> So, what do you think? Don&#x27;t you want to go on a date like that?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ummm... I want to wear a China dress, but... Everything after that is a little...<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> To begin with, it&#x27;s hard to imagine such a convenient group of thugs would appear at such convenient timing...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Come onnn... But I came up with the strongest, most exciting Chinatown fantasy date plan in history...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Wawah, Yui&#x27;s all depressed now...<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> If we were to leave her like this, it would weigh on our conscience, wouldn&#x27;t it. We have to come up with something to support her...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Yui, I think everybody has their own different kind of date they dream about, but I got to have a lot of fun today because you were with us! So thanks.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> That&#x27;s right. And, I was able to mostly understand what the definition of a date is too...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> You mean it!? I&#x27;m so glad~! I should be the one thanking you two! Getting to go on a three girl date through Chinatown made me the happiest girl in the world!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> A three girl date...? Can you really call an outing with three people a date? Sigh... I&#x27;m understanding the definition less and less.  </p><div class="videoWrapper"><iframe width="640" height="480" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mM0jQ11E1pE"></iframe></div><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="pirate---yui-start-after-the-mission-were-pirates"></a>[Pirate - Yui: Start]: After the Mission, We&#x27;re Pirates!<a class="hash-link" href="#pirate---yui-start-after-the-mission-were-pirates" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Aradama:</strong> GGGII...!<br>

<strong>Ellen:</strong> You&#x27;re not going to make anything happen like that, Yuiyui. But thanks all the same.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Cool older girls are a treasure of their own!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Yui-chan!? There&#x27;s an aradama coming after you!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Thanks! Nice spot, Kiyoka-chan!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> --ORYAAAAAAAAAAA!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That should be all the aradama around here for now.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Sigh... You made me worried because you were looking away so much.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Sorry, sorry. My eyes&#x27;ll stay glued to you from now on, so forgive me, Kiyoka-chan!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You&#x27;re not giving me any reason to forgive you at all.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Eh!?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Ahaha. The investigation team really gets along, don&#x27;t they.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> When we first met, I never thought it would turn out like this, but we&#x27;re just fine now. It&#x27;s fun being with everyone.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Mmhmm. I love all the girls in the investigation team, so I always want to be with them wherever they go.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Yui-chan... Stalking is absolutely off limits, okay?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> You&#x27;ve got it all wrong. I&#x27;ll be there at all times to protect my lovable investigation team from any perverts out there. It&#x27;s a great idea!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> You sure do come up with some unique ideas, Yuiyui.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I knew you&#x27;d understand! I love you, Ellen-san!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Yui~. I love you too.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> E-Ellen-san... Please, for our sakes, don&#x27;t encourage Yui-chan too much...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> It would be a good idea though, if you didn&#x27;t have to worry about Yuiyui&#x27;s own health and safety. But there wouldn&#x27;t be any time for Yuiyui herself to rest.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Keeping an eye on good looking girls would fill me up with power, so I think it has a chance to work!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> There isn&#x27;t one, okay? You don&#x27;t have a chance.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> You don&#x27;t miss a beat playing off each other. It&#x27;s perfect.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Kiyoka~, Yui~, Ellen-saaan~!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Hono-chan? Are you done over there too?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah! Akira-san was with me and all. And Satsuki-san knew just where the aradama would be going, so it made fighting easy.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> --But hey, that wasn&#x27;t what I wanted to talk about. The person in charge of the amusement park asked, after we&#x27;re done clearing out the aradama, if we wanted to play around in the park a little!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> And also, with this new attraction they just started! &quot;The Treasures of Pirates&quot;! You want to try it, right?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Sure we will!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> That&#x27;s the one where they lend you pirate costumes, right? Boss would probably look so good in that! I wanna see it!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It does sound kind of fun. But, what about Kofuki-san and Juujou-san?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> I think they&#x27;ll be fine with it, but I&#x27;ll check with them just in case.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah, thanks for that!

<strong>Ellen:</strong> You have to go all out with this kind of thing! You should enjoy it as much as you can too, Kiyoka!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Alright! Then... Captain Yui! What treasure are we after this time?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> The treasures that I&#x27;m after. That&#x27;d be--<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> The fine and dashing ladies of the pirate groups Captain Suu and Captain Boss are leading around!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> What!?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> You can all be under my command... Eheheheh.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Our objective is to find treasure pendants hidden by old pirates by using our maps before the time runs out...!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> If we steal the other team&#x27;s maps, we&#x27;ll get points, but girls don&#x27;t get us anything.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> If we get the girls, we get the maps too! That way we get all the spoils, Kiyoka-chan.<br>

<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> So stealing their maps is our first goal then?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Does that we won&#x27;t use the clues on the map we have to find the treasure until later?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Yep. The maps aren&#x27;t all going to be real ones, and besides, doesn&#x27;t plundering sound like a real pirate thing to do?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Aye aye sir! We&#x27;ll plunder with all we&#x27;ve got!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Uhh... Aye aye sir...!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Then, we&#x27;re setting off!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ah, I&#x27;ve got eyes on Captain Boss&#x27;s ship!<br>

<strong>Yuui:</strong> Mihono-chan, Boss, Satsuki-san; they&#x27;re all looking so good...! Ahhh~!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Boss&#x27;s miniskirt...! Those tempting thighs...!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ah! They&#x27;re boarding us!?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Honestly... Come down from the crow&#x27;s nest and protect our pirate flag, Yui-chan!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Aye aye sir! I&#x27;ll be there to protect you, Kiyoka-chan!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Alright, let&#x27;s do all we can to protect our captain and pirate flag!<br>

<strong>Ellen:</strong> We&#x27;re not going to go down so easy, Inagon, Yomiyomi!<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Well bring it on!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> While we were fighting, Hiyoyon and them found the treasure.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> We might&#x27;ve lost, but it was still fun-! And I got pictures of everybody&#x27;s pirate cosplay!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> You always put everything into having a good time, Yuiyui. I think that&#x27;s so nice.<br>

I want to keep getting more and more treasures for myself!  </p><div class="videoWrapper"><iframe width="640" height="480" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/szCgvSydsCY"></iframe></div><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="taisho-romance-military-uniform---yui-start-click"></a>[Taisho Romance Military Uniform - Yui: Start]: Click!<a class="hash-link" href="#taisho-romance-military-uniform---yui-start-click" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Yui:</strong> ............<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I wish the whole investigation team would cosplay for me...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...What are you saying now?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Kiyoka-chan!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I&#x27;m going on a journey! And, I&#x27;m going to find cosplay that everybody&#x27;ll look good in!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...You don&#x27;t have to come back, Yui-chan.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> And so, I set out on my journey to search for cosplay!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Just wait, Kiyoka-chan! I&#x27;ll make sure to find the very best cosplay for you!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Hmh!? My hot girl-dar is picking something up! That&#x27;s...<br>
<strong>Aoto Hina:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Heyyy! Hina-saaan! Where are you going-!<br>
<strong>Hina:</strong> Ah, Yui-chan! Rare to see you around here.<br>
<strong>Hina:</strong> Need something from our place? Pa should be in right about now...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ah; it&#x27;s not like that! I&#x27;m actually on a journey to find cosplay the investigation team&#x27;ll look great in!<br>
<strong>Hina:</strong> ...Ah, i-is that why. I&#x27;m making a delivery to an important customer, so I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be much help with that...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> That&#x27;s... a cool looking sword you have there. Ah, but, there&#x27;s no edge to it... Is it a fake?<br>
<strong>Hina:</strong> Yep; it&#x27;s a prop for a movie they&#x27;re shooting.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> A MOVIE!?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> It all sorta just clicked for me! Is it okay if I go along with you for that!?<br>
<strong>Hina:</strong> Probably, but... I&#x27;m going to check with them just to be sure, so give me a sec.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Okay!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> This is it--------!! Please give me these costumes!!<br>
<strong>Director:</strong> ......I said she could come because she&#x27;s a friend of yours, Hina-chan, but...<br>
<strong>Hina:</strong> ...I&#x27;m sorry. She&#x27;s not a bad girl... Just a weird one.<br>
<strong>Director:</strong> You&#x27;re telling me... Err, what do you want these costumes for?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> There&#x27;s people I want to put them on! Like, Mirja-san and Chie-san&#x27;d look absolutely perfect in it!<br>
<strong>Director:</strong> I see... In that case, what about this. If they help out with the filming, I&#x27;ll let them wear those clothes.<br>
<strong>Director:</strong> How does that sound?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> We&#x27;ll help-!!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="taisho-romance-military-uniform---yui-end-theres-no-moe"></a>[Taisho Romance Military Uniform - Yui: End]: There&#x27;s No Moe!<a class="hash-link" href="#taisho-romance-military-uniform---yui-end-theres-no-moe" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Yui:</strong> Please, Mirja-san! Chie-san! Help film this movie with me!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Mmm... Sorry, Yui-chan. I have coursework I have to take care of.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Now would be difficult for me as well. Please ask someone else to help.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> That&#x27;s a shame... Even if I wanted to find other people...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ugh... D-Don&#x27;t tell me...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Sorry, Kiyoka-chan... I want a grown up onee-san girl in those clothes! It wouldn&#x27;t work for you!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I-I&#x27;m saved... but, I&#x27;m not satisfied with why!!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Hmm...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Onee-sans that could hold a candle to Mirja-san and Chie-san... Can I find anybody like that...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> THERE THEY ARE!!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Tadaaah! Well; how do I look?<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> I put it on, &#x27;cause you were saying I had to... Does this actually look any good on me?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> You two look fantastic! This is it, right here! This is what I wanted to see!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ahh, it&#x27;s too much, seriously too much... I&#x27;m about to get a nosebleed...<br>
<strong>Hina:</strong> UWAH-!? Not about to; there&#x27;s blood pouring out!? Here, c&#x27;mon and lie down here, before it gets on your costume!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Th-Thank you very mush...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ah, Hina-san&#x27;s thighs... I could die happy laying on these...<br>
<strong>Hina:</strong> Quit being silly; let&#x27;s get your nosebleed to stop. Filming&#x27;s going to start soon.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Shure... I found heaven here...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Now I&#x27;ve made my film debut!<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Debut? We just got total side roles. Is it really worth celebrating that much?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> You should celebrate too, Inagon!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> She&#x27;s right! You two looked amazing cosplaying!<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Hah? What do you mean? You&#x27;re the one who looked way better than us.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> ...Huh?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> I agree with Inagon. I think the director wanted to make you an extra after seeing you, Yuiyui.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Sigh... That director sure has some strange sensibilities.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I mean, I did think I looked alright in it, but I&#x27;m not feeling any moe from my own cosplay!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I really just want somebody to cosplay for me!<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> I was giving you a compliment... Guess it&#x27;s no use with you.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Though, that&#x27;s just what I&#x27;d expect from Yuiyui.  </p><div class="videoWrapper"><iframe width="640" height="480" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w9aCtUPAX8k"></iframe></div><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="star-ocean---yui-start-i-want-to-touch-your-ears"></a>[Star Ocean - Yui: Start]: I Want to Touch Your Ears!<a class="hash-link" href="#star-ocean---yui-start-i-want-to-touch-your-ears" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Rena Lanford:</strong> Alright, let&#x27;s go looking for those aradama, Yui.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Sure!<br>

<strong>Rena:</strong> Like what?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Please let me touch those cute ears of yours, Rena-san!!<br>
<strong>Rena:</strong> Eh? That&#x27;s really sudden.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> It might seem sudden, but it&#x27;s not sudden at all! I&#x27;ve been wanting it this whole time!<br>
<strong>Rena:</strong> Yui? That look on your face is scaring me...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> You let Mai-chan touch them, right!? So what&#x27;s wrong with letting me touch them too!!<br>
<strong>Rena:</strong> J-Just calm down, Yui-chan!!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I wanna rub your ears, Rena-sannnnnnn!<br>
<strong>Rena:</strong> KYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> You don&#x27;t have to run, Rena-san-!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> [Pant pant]... Sorry, I calmed down now.<br>
<strong>Rena:</strong> I-If you&#x27;re calmed down, that&#x27;s good.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Phew, we ran so much I worked up a good sweat! I&#x27;ll go get us something to drink, so just wait here.<br>
<strong>Rena:</strong> O-Okay.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Here, this one&#x27;s yours.<br>
<strong>Rena:</strong> Thanks, Yui.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> You&#x27;re very welcome!<br>
<strong>Rena:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Umm, you&#x27;re going to make me embarrassed if you keep staring, okay?<br>
<strong>Rena:</strong> Ah, sorry.<br>
<strong>Rena:</strong> ...Did you really want to touch my ears that badly, Yui?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Of course I do! Anybody&#x27;d want to touch a cute girl&#x27;s ears!<br>
<strong>Rena:</strong> ...Is that right.<br>
<strong>Rena:</strong> ...I&#x27;ll let you do it now that you calmed down, okay? But, just for a little bit!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> You mean it!?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> ...Oh, too bad. Looks like it&#x27;s time for us to get to work.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Let&#x27;s go handle this, Rena-san!<br>
<strong>Rena:</strong> Yeah.<br>

<strong>Aradama:</strong> OOoooo...<br>
<strong>Rena:</strong> Mm, it&#x27;s going well!<br>

<strong>Yui:</strong> Watch out, Rena-san!<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> GOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> You&#x27;re not laying a finger on such a pretty girl!!<br>
<strong>Rena:</strong> Th-Thanks for that, Yui.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> This is no big deal!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Rena-san. I really appreciate how you&#x27;re softening the aradama up for me.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> But, I&#x27;m pretty strong myself. So... how about we fight more back to back, with the two of us?<br>
<strong>Rena:</strong> Yui...<br>
<strong>Rena:</strong> Okay, let&#x27;s fight together!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Yeah!<br>
<strong>Rena:</strong> We beat the aradama... but I didn&#x27;t see any energy stones.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Mmm, looks like they were just normal aradama after all.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> But, we took care of them and neither of us got hurt, so it&#x27;s all okay either way!<br>
<strong>Rena:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Rena:</strong> You&#x27;re pretty popular with girls, aren&#x27;t you, Yui?<br>
