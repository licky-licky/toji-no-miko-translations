heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> Oh yeah, so what&#x27;s your friend like, Musumi-san? You said you were close to someone at Heijou.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> She&#x27;s really energetic, and she loves animals.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Ah, I&#x27;m curious too. Do you mind if I listen in?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Sure. She&#x27;s a year older than me though. When we first met, we were on a mission together...<br>
<strong>Naruse Miki:</strong> We in Naruse Squad will be pursuing the aradama who have fled into the mountains... Hm? Where&#x27;d Himeno-san run off to? She was just here a moment ago.<br>
<strong>Miki:</strong> Hmmm... Musumi-san, could you go look for her? We can&#x27;t operate effectively if we&#x27;re all split up~<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah... Okay. I&#x27;ll try.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Himeno-saaan... Where are you... Himeno-saaan!<br>
<strong>Himeno Shiho:</strong> Shh! Don&#x27;t make too much noise!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> H-Himeno-san...<br>
Meow- Meow- Meow- Meow-</p><p><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> There&#x27;s... Kittens...?<br>
<strong>Shiho:</strong> Aren&#x27;t they adorable? With the aradama in the area, I felt like I had to keep them safe.<br>
<strong>Shiho:</strong> But something&#x27;s not right. I looked around the area and couldn&#x27;t find their mom anywhere.<br>
<strong>Shiho:</strong> If we don&#x27;t find her soon, she might get mixed up in the Special Ritual Squad fighting the aradama, and then...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> What was that...?<br>
<strong>Shiho:</strong> Just what I was afraid of... That sounds like the aradama... They must be after the mother!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> How terrible... Himeno-san, we have to get the rest of the squad...<br>
<strong>Shiho:</strong> I won&#x27;t let them hurt her!<br>
<strong>Shiho:</strong> Pant... Pant...<br>
<strong>Shiho:</strong> Sorry, Musumi-san. I got carried away and pulled you into that... I&#x27;m a failure as a senpai.<br>
Meow- Meow- Meow- Meow-</p><p><strong>Shiho:</strong> Sorry. When I thought these kittens and their mom could get hurt, I lost control and abandoned the rest of the squad.<br>
<strong>Shiho:</strong> And even then, I was too late... Their mother...<br>
<strong>Shiho:</strong> But still, you remind me of those kittens, Musumi-san. Always so weak and innocent... For me to put you in danger like that...<br>
<strong>Shiho:</strong> That&#x27;s why... I&#x27;m... I&#x27;m really sorry.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Don&#x27;t be! You don&#x27;t have to apologize. I... I don&#x27;t like to fight... I hate it, but... I understand how you feel, Himeko-san.<br>
<strong>Shiho:</strong> Thank you. But, for me to run off on my own like this, I&#x27;m going to get punished pretty hard, aren&#x27;t I...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Umm... Probably...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...And that&#x27;s what happened. After we reunited with everyone else, we both got scolded a lot. But I don&#x27;t think they were actually mad at us.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ahh, I would have felt the same. You just gotta help out at a time like that!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Himeno Shiho-san really loves animals, doesn&#x27;t she?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Yes. Whenever I go on missions with Shiho-san, she&#x27;s always teaching me about what kind of animals live around there... I hate having to fight, but that makes it kind of fun~.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="2-do-you-like-it-or-do-you-hate-it"></a>2: Do You Like It? Or Do You Hate It?<a class="hash-link" href="#2-do-you-like-it-or-do-you-hate-it" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> Hey, Kiyoka, do you wanna come train with me?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Me? Are you sure? You could probably find someone better...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Well, Chii-nee and Mirja-san were both busy. Plus, I want to find out how strong you really are.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...O-Okay, I&#x27;ll try it.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> We&#x27;ll use wooden swords in a three round match. It&#x27;s not first to two wins, just three whole rounds.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Here I come!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Eh...? What was that... I couldn&#x27;t get through!?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Then, round two, let&#x27;s start.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Twice in a row... Alright! This is where it counts!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Y-Yes.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I&#x27;m going to seriously come at you now!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...I couldn&#x27;t win a single round in the end.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...What the heck! I don&#x27;t believe it!? Kiyoka, you&#x27;re crazy strong!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Honestly, in that last fight, I felt like I put everything into my swings, but it was like hitting a wall. I couldn&#x27;t break your guard.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ahhh, I feel so weak! This sucks...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Um... I-I just... Sor-<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Stop right there! You were about to say sorry, right! You&#x27;re not allowed to!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Instead, I want you to explain something to me. How can you be that strong but so scared of fighting?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Because you could get hurt, and it&#x27;s scary, isn&#x27;t it? I mean...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Even with utsushi on, you can still feel pain. And if utsushi gets broken and you&#x27;re attacked by an okatana or an aradama, you could die, you know?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I&#x27;m the one who doesn&#x27;t understand... How all of you can be okay with it.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> And that&#x27;s why you avoid fighting?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...Yes.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I love practicing with wooden and imitation swords in the dojo...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> In the dojo, I used to be called a &quot;genius&quot; and &quot;prodigy&quot;... But I don&#x27;t think I deserved it.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I just really loved practicing with a sword. As I kept rising through the ranks, everyone had these expectations that I&#x27;d go out and fight aradama, and I was sent to the Heijou Institute...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> But... I was useless.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> When it came to actual fighting, you were frozen in fear?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Yes.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> To cut someone or be cut by someone else, or to be injured by an aradama... It really scares me. In the end, I just love the practice of martial arts.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That&#x27;s why, fighting you now, Asakura-san, was the first time in a long while that I&#x27;ve enjoyed it. I forgot everything else and only focused on our match... So, thank you very much for asking to train with me today.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="3-teruhiro-and-kagemitsu"></a>3: Teruhiro and Kagemitsu<a class="hash-link" href="#3-teruhiro-and-kagemitsu" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>???:</strong> Hey, hey, you there, from Heijou!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah, uh, yes!?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> W-Who might you be...?<br>
<strong>Koike Saaya:</strong> Whoops, sorry. It&#x27;s rare to see someone else from Heijou around here, so I just had to call out to you. I&#x27;m Koike Saaya, a third year high schooler at Heijou.<br>
<strong>Saaya:</strong> Ever since last September I&#x27;ve been interning here; getting on the job training at the prefectural police station. Ah, it&#x27;s just deskwork though.<br>
<strong>Saaya:</strong> So are you here to watch the tournament? Wait, if you were here to see that, you&#x27;d already... Have gone back...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> K-Koike-san? I-Is something wrong?<br>
<strong>Saaya:</strong> I might be mistaken, but... Is that Teruhiro?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah, yes. My okatana is Renge Fudou Teruhiro.<br>
<strong>Saaya:</strong> Ahh... I knew it. It&#x27;s been so long, but... It doesn&#x27;t feel real... I&#x27;m even tearing up... That used to be my okatana, you see.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Eh...?<br>
<strong>Saaya:</strong> Ah, sorry... Meeting the previous owner must be like running into your lover&#x27;s old ex, huh? It&#x27;s not really a happy topic.<br>
<strong>Saaya:</strong> I made this really awkward. Sorry! Just pretend I didn&#x27;t say anything.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> No, it&#x27;s not like that... Um, if you don&#x27;t mind, I&#x27;d like to hear more about that, actually...!<br>
<strong>Saaya:</strong> Okay. But first, can you tell me about yourself too?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> To tell you the truth, Renge Fudou Teruhiro is my second okatana. Originally, I had a different one... Koryuu Kagemitsu. That one chose me first...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Apparently I had better compatibility with it than anyone else, and so it was officially given to me. I loved it so much too, and thought we&#x27;d always be together. But, last fall, it suddenly stopped responding to me...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It must have been... Because I&#x27;m such a weakling, that it ran out of patience. I... I don&#x27;t like to fight, and so because of that, Kagemitsu just gave up on me.<br>
<strong>Saaya:</strong> I see. ...Hmm. Can you let me hold Teruhiro?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah, sure, here you go.<br>
<strong>Saaya:</strong> I just need to borrow him for a minute...<br>
<strong>Saaya:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Saaya:</strong> Mm, I can still do jin&#x27;i, and I could even form utsushi a little now. Holding it like this reminds me what it was like to be a toji.<br>
<strong>Saaya:</strong> Though, it&#x27;s a little embarrassing to admit, but... As a toji, I was pretty mediocre. Here, you can have him back.<br>
<strong>Saaya:</strong> ...About three years ago, they found someone more capable of using Renge Fudou Teruhiro than me. At that time, I handed in my okatana and retired from being a toji.<br>
<strong>Saaya:</strong> It all ended so fast, but I didn&#x27;t feel like I had any regrets. If anything, doing support work like I am now suits me much better.<br>
<strong>Saaya:</strong> ...Hey, Kiyoka-chan. Don&#x27;t you think Teruhiro feels very kind?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Eh...?<br>
<strong>Saaya:</strong> After all, even after Koryuu Kagemitsu left you, Teruhiro stayed by your side.<br>
<strong>Saaya:</strong> Even after I haven&#x27;t held him in three years, letting me use my powers again was like his way of saying &quot;Welcome back&quot;.<br>
<strong>Saaya:</strong> I&#x27;m sure whoever it was that owned him between me and you was helped out by that kindness as well.<br>
<strong>Saaya:</strong> Can&#x27;t you feel it? Throughout your whole body, like he&#x27;s reassuring you, &quot;I don&#x27;t mind if you&#x27;re weak.&quot;<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Renge Fudou Teruhiro... Doesn&#x27;t mind...?<br>
<strong>Saaya:</strong> That&#x27;s it. So right now, please take good care of him for me. And if you do that, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll grow into a strong woman.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> A strong woman?<br>
<strong>Saaya:</strong> Yeah, a strong woman who can strike out beautifully with a blade. Teruhiro wants you to grow stronger together.ã€€Strong enough that one day you&#x27;ll make even Koryuu Kagemitsu jealous!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Koike-senpai...<br>
<strong>Saaya:</strong> Oh, you finally smiled! Ah~, but then you&#x27;ll have two okatana calling after you. You&#x27;ll have to deal with how tough it can be being popular, Kiyoka-chan~.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah...

<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Well, I have a teacher... Or more like, a role model.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> A friend of yours? What&#x27;s she like? How&#x27;d you meet her?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Mihono-chan, if you keep asking her questions she won&#x27;t have time to answer any...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It&#x27;s okay. Well, she&#x27;s...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I have to get to the school store! It&#x27;s going to sell out! Today&#x27;s the release of the new monthly issue!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> And Kamo Chinami-san is on the cover! I have to get it!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I mean...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Kamo Chinami-san is such a hot topic right now. She&#x27;s so pretty, and fashionable, and her swordfighting techniques are cool in a cute way, and she&#x27;s just so beautiful from head to toe.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Boys fall in love with her and girls want to be like her. It&#x27;s not surprising that the squad she&#x27;s in gets chased around by journalists looking to upload new photos to the internet.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> When I think of the word &quot;heroine&quot;, without a doubt, it&#x27;s Chinami-senpai that comes to mind.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...That&#x27;s right. She&#x27;s the complete opposite of an unappealing girl like me, who&#x27;s useless at anything that&#x27;s not in a dojo...<br>

<strong>Chinami:</strong> You want it after all, don&#x27;t you?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> N-No, I don&#x27;t mind if you take it...<br>
<strong>Chinami:</strong> Really? Is that how you really feel? I think you just don&#x27;t want to let anyone take what you want from you. Well, that&#x27;s how a girl ought to be!<br>
<strong>Chinami:</strong> I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything wrong with that!<br>
<strong>Chinami:</strong> Hey, what&#x27;s your name?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> M-My name...? It&#x27;s... Musumi Kiyoka...<br>
<strong>Chinami:</strong> Then I&#x27;m Kamo Chinami... But you knew that already, didn&#x27;t you? Alright then, Kiyoka. You win this one.<br>
<strong>Chinami:</strong> My friend can just wait for the publisher to send me a copy. Here, you keep this one.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Eh...?<br>
<strong>Chinami:</strong> Oh yeah, you said you always buy this magazine? You&#x27;ve got some good fashion sense. That&#x27;s promising.<br>
<strong>Chinami:</strong> You just need to start putting it into practice. If you want to be something, you&#x27;ve gotta try being it~<br>
<strong>Chinami:</strong> Anyway, I have to get going! If you ever want any tips about fashion, feel free to ask me, okay? Onee-san here&#x27;ll give you a total makeover!<br>
<strong>Chinami:</strong> See you around! Bye!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> And that&#x27;s how we met.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I didn&#x27;t get a chance to apologize to her then, so I went to see her later. And we kept getting closer ever since...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> It almost sounds like... You got picked up by someone handsome.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I guess she&#x27;s my handsome onee-san?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> I&#x27;ve heard of her, Kamo Chinami-san. She does amateur modeling. You&#x27;re surprisingly well connected, Kiyoka-chan...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Is this her femininity in action!?  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="5-thesis-what-is-femininity"></a>5: Thesis! What is Femininity!<a class="hash-link" href="#5-thesis-what-is-femininity" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> Grrrrrr.... Grr.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Why are you looking so upset, Hono-chan? That&#x27;s not like you.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Don&#x27;t act like you&#x27;re so innocent... (Stare......)<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> W-What is it...? When you stare at me like that... I-It&#x27;s really embarrassing...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> There! There it is! That bashfulness!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> It must be nice, Kiyoka~ Having that much femininity... Meanwhile, I&#x27;ve got none of that...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> There it is!!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Eh!? W-What is...?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Just now, you said &quot;femininity&quot;, didn&#x27;t you, Hono-chan!? What does &quot;femininity&quot; mean to you!?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> What&#x27;s up with you!? It&#x27;s not like you to be so aggressive, Kiyoka... That scared me.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah... I&#x27;m sorry. I&#x27;ll explain. The other day, Yanase Mai-san and I were baking cookies together, and we got into a discussion about what femininity means.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> S-So that&#x27;s why...? Well, femininity means &quot;cute and girly things&quot;, doesn&#x27;t it? You&#x27;ve got a lot of it, Kiyoka. You&#x27;re cute and make me want to protect you.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Really, you think I&#x27;m cute...? But that&#x27;s not important right now! Hono-chan, that way of thinking is wrong!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Listen up! You could say femininity means &quot;for a girl to be alluring while doing girly things&quot;!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> O-Okay...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> But, to be more fashionable. To be a better cook. To be more considerate. To be more accepting... There are all kinds of answers, yet all of them are right!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That&#x27;s why... Femininity is something only you can decide on the definition of!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> For each person to imagine their ideal girl, and then to put in effort making that a reality... That&#x27;s what &quot;femininity&quot; is all about!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Essentially...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> For each and every girl out there, there&#x27;s a different definition of femininity! Understand? That&#x27;s the final answer I&#x27;ve arrived at!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> (How&#x27;s that!)<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I-I guess... You have a point there...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Right? So you could get stronger at swordfighting and become a cooler girl! That&#x27;s an ideal! Thinking like that, practicing swordfighting is a perfectly valid way of raising your femininity!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> A sword isn&#x27;t just a way of becoming stronger, but also cuter in a cool way! In that sense, you&#x27;re training in two things at once! If you want to be more popular, you just need to think about what makes a female swordfighter popular in the first place!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...Phew! Without an ideal to strive for, you&#x27;ll never express your femininity!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I-I think I get it... An ideal. Okay...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> (I&#x27;ve never seen Kiyoka like this before. I&#x27;m still sort of reeling...)  </p><div class="videoWrapper"><iframe width="640" height="480" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6_yDBybZI3Y"></iframe></div><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="bride-19-start-undercover-investigation-kiyokas-case"></a>[Bride &#x27;19: Start]: Undercover Investigation (Kiyoka&#x27;s Case)<a class="hash-link" href="#bride-19-start-undercover-investigation-kiyokas-case" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Yui:</strong> Ehhh!? Aradama showed up at the wedding chapel again!?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Mm, it sounds like it.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Apparently another ring was stolen, so maybe it&#x27;s the same aradama from before?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Stealing a ring from a bride-to-be at the happiest moment of her life; Yamashiro Yui, ally to women around the world, won&#x27;t let this stand!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...Though sometimes, you&#x27;re their enemy.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ahaha, there you go again with your jokes~.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> A ha ha ha.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Kiyoka-chan, your smile&#x27;s looking a little forced, isn&#x27;t it-?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka/Yui:</strong> An undercover investigation?<br>
<strong>Chapel Staff:</strong> That&#x27;s right. If one of you acts as a decoy, we can find where the aradama hid the ring, right?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> ...Did you know about this? [whispered]<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> No, they only said we&#x27;d learn the details when we arrived... [whispered]<br>
<strong>Chapel Staff:</strong> Um...?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ah, it&#x27;s nothing! That&#x27;ll be just fine with us! Please, just let us handle everything!<br>
<strong>Chapel Staff:</strong> We&#x27;ll be counting on you then. So... Which of you will wear the wedding dress?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka/Yui:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> (I want to wear a wedding dress! But, Yui-chan...)<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Hm? What could be on your mind, Kiyoka-chan? Here, don&#x27;t be shy, let&#x27;s get you into that dress!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> But...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Huh, do you not want to wear it? You like wedding dresses, don&#x27;t you, Kiyoka-chan?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I-I do.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I&#x27;m just teasing you. I know what you&#x27;re thinking. You&#x27;re worried I&#x27;m going to do something weird, right?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You realized!?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Of course, it&#x27;s me we&#x27;re talking about.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Then... You won&#x27;t come in while I&#x27;m changing?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I- won&#x27;t- come- in-?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Why did that sound so phony!?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Sorry, sorry, I&#x27;m just kidding, Kiyoka-chan. I would never force my way in on you while you&#x27;re changing.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> We&#x27;re in a wedding chapel after all, so I&#x27;ll swear to God to keep my word.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Still...<br>
<strong>Chapel Staff:</strong> Excuse me, you can lock the waiting room door, so...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Okay! I&#x27;ll dress up as the decoy!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> That&#x27;s how little you trust me!?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Fu, fufufu... As if I&#x27;d try. Peeping on you while you were changing was never what I was after, Kiyoka-chan...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> It&#x27;s my chance to see you in a wedding dress, so I have to make sure you get changed first! Excuse me, Mr. Staffmember! Could I please borrow a camera!<br>
<strong>Chapel Staff:</strong> A... Camera?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> That&#x27;s right! I need a camera, to record the aradama from a distance!<br>
<strong>Chapel Staff:</strong> Oh, of course! I&#x27;ll get you one right away!<br>

<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> There wasn&#x27;t any sign of her trying to unlock the door, so she wasn&#x27;t lying.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Sigh, I should have trusted her more... I was rude to Yui-chan, wasn&#x27;t I...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Oh, welcome back, Kiyoka-chan! You look so good in that wedding dress! We should get married right away!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Thank you... Hey, why do you have that camera!? You didn&#x27;t have it before, did you!?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> That&#x27;s the expression I&#x27;m looking for!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Answer the question!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Why...? The staff here lent it to me.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Why would they do that!?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> All I had to do was say I wanted to record pictures of the aradama, and they handed it right over.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Of course they would, if you put it like that...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Pretty quick thinking on my part, huh?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It&#x27;s devious...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> KYAA-!?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Got that expression too! It&#x27;s so good-, you&#x27;re so cute, Chan-kiyo!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Chan-kiyo...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> But, no matter what, a girl&#x27;s smile is always best! Go on, smile for me!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> And if you&#x27;d try flaunting your chest while you&#x27;re at it, I&#x27;d be even happier!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Well I&#x27;m sorry you can&#x27;t see my chest unless I flaunt it, okay!?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> All breasts, big and small, are beautiful, Kiyoka-chan!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That&#x27;s not making me feel any better-!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Hmmm, I thought you&#x27;d be acting more embarrassed... Whoopsie.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Stop trying to embarrass me so you can take pictures...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I&#x27;m just screwing around, you know. Since you do get to wear a wedding dress and all, wouldn&#x27;t you want some pictures taken?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You seemed totally serious to me... But, still... This wedding dress is very cute...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Isn&#x27;t it? So just leave it to me, your cameraman.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Yui-chan... Why are you down there on the floor?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Well I have to take some low angle shots of you, don&#x27;t I? Don&#x27;t worry, I&#x27;ll be sure your panties don&#x27;t show up in the pictures!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Panties...!?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Did you just take a picture of them!?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Relax, the only record of your panties is safe in my memories.<br>

You might not be able to rely on me for much... But I look forward to working with you.<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> That&#x27;s not true at all. I&#x27;ll be counting on you, Kiyoka.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> (Th-That&#x27;s right. A hero like Fuu-san might be helping to clear out the aradama... But this is where a toji like me needs to get it together...!)<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Umm... Then, let&#x27;s give it everything we&#x27;ve got, Fuu-san!<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> Are you maybe feeling a bit nervous today?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah... No, it&#x27;s not like that!<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> Then, that&#x27;s fine, but it&#x27;s not good for you to go all out all the time, alright?<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> If you can&#x27;t show your strength when it counts, you&#x27;ll be in trouble, won&#x27;t you?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You&#x27;re right about that. To tell the truth... I was feeling like I had to try even harder than usual.<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> That feeling&#x27;s important too. There&#x27;s not a single thing wrong with feeling that way.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> How is it you can be so calm, Fuu-san? You&#x27;re going through so much trouble, coming to our world and then helping us fight aradama, and yet...<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> It&#x27;s because I&#x27;m the leader of the Hero Club. Who&#x27;s going to follow me if I don&#x27;t take everything in stride?<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> Though it&#x27;s not really like that. It&#x27;s hard for me to put in words, but, well... We&#x27;re the ones who decided to help out defeating the aradama, and we know we can trust you toji.<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> Anyway, if things get bad, I can just weaken the aradama with my overflowing girl power, so I&#x27;ll be counting on you to finish them off, Kiyoka.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Your overflowing... Girl power!<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> GUGGGGGIIII...!!<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> Ah, there they are!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Let&#x27;s go, Fuu-san!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...And so that&#x27;s what happened. She was a big help, getting me over my strange nervousness and finishing up our mission.<br>
<strong>Itsuki:</strong> Onee-chan is good at picking up on things like that.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Fuu-san has a strong sense of leadership, doesn&#x27;t she. It&#x27;s a different from Mirja-san, but I found myself depending on her before I knew it.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> On top of that, she&#x27;s so cool and feminine.<br>
<strong>Itsuki:</strong> Hmmm... I feel like you&#x27;re the more feminine one, Kiyoka-san. You know so much about fashion, and the way you accessorize is cute too.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I&#x27;m not that... I still have a long ways to go. I also heard about Fuu-san that her cooking is her specialty.<br>
<strong>Itsuki:</strong> Onee-chan&#x27;s cooking is delicious. She does all the chores around home too.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> She&#x27;s incredible... I really look up to her. I might&#x27;ve wanted to have a big sister like that myself.<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> What do you think, Itsuki? About your reliable big sister you&#x27;re so proud of.<br>
<strong>Itsuki:</strong> Come on, Onee-chan. You&#x27;re letting it go to your head.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Fuu-san!<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> Ah, sorry for getting caught up in the moment.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I... I want to learn to be as feminine as you are, Fuu-san! Could I ask you to give me special training to raise my girl power...!?<br>
<strong>Itsuki:</strong> Ehh...!? Um, Kiyoka-san... I think it would be best if you didn&#x27;t go there. About Oee-chan&#x27;s... girl power...<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> I hear your request loud and clear. I don&#x27;t know how long it will take, but I&#x27;ll do all I can to help boost your girl power, Kiyoka!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah, thank you very much... Fuu-san!<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> The road to improving your girl power is steep and perilous. We&#x27;ll start your training straight away, Kiyoka!<br>

We just ate a little while ago, so why are Fuu-senpai and Kiyoka-chan sitting in front of bowls of udon?<br>
<strong>Itsuki:</strong> That&#x27;s because...<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> There&#x27;s lots of things that can boost your girl power, like practicing cooking and stuff, but the most effective method is udon!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Udon!?<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> That&#x27;s right. Udon is packed with all the ingredients you need for girl power! And-, with enough girl power, you can do anything-!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I-I got it!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> (I don&#x27;t exactly understand... why eating udon is meant to make you more feminine. But I just have to have faith in Fuu-san for now.)<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> Now, eat up the udon that&#x27;s loved by all across the nation, and raise up your girl power!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Udon is loved on that kind of level in the world you came from!?<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> Sure; udon is at the very tip top of gourmet food. Come on, while it&#x27;s still hot!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I-I&#x27;ll give it a try...!<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> [chew chew]... Even in this world, udon&#x27;s still the best! ...It&#x27;s filling me up!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Yes... It&#x27;s very tasty, isn&#x27;t it!<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> I think I&#x27;ll just keep going on into seconds...?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> [chew chew]... A-Already!? I-I have to... try harder too-!<br>
<strong>Tougou:</strong> Ahh... You can&#x27;t do that, Kiyoka-chan. If you try to have as many helpings as Fuu-senpai...<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> Thank you for coming along to the Inubouzaki Fuu-style Girl Power Boosting Special Training.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I&#x27;m sorry, but... Fuu-san? We ate udon and then exercised together, but I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;ve gotten any more girl power yet...<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> Girl power is something that exudes on its own. You might not feel it right away, but when you do, you&#x27;ll know for sure it&#x27;s gone up. Believe you me!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Girl power exudes on its own... You sure know your stuff, Fuu-san.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I understand then! Now, let&#x27;s go and do a good job of suppressing aradama again today.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah! There&#x27;s a big park nearby here. I don&#x27;t want to let the aradama come near it.<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> Of course. We wouldn&#x27;t want anyone to get hurt.<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> Kiyoka! I drove it over your way! I&#x27;m counting on you!<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> ...!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> --HAAA!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> The readings from aradama in the area are gone. It seems like that was the last one.<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> Nice job-. Toji sure are something else. You had my eyes glued to the way you were handling that sword of yours.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It&#x27;s just really easy to coordinate with you, Fuu-san. So, I sort of feel like I should be thanking you.<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> You don&#x27;t have to thank me or anything. You&#x27;re already doing a lot for us. Ah, actually, mind if we stop by somewhere for a bit?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Wow... It&#x27;s so pretty here. I&#x27;ve never been to this park before.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It&#x27;s a good thing we stopped the aradama from running amok here.<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> That&#x27;s for sure-. That&#x27;s another thing you worked hard for, Kiyoka.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That&#x27;s not true... It wasn&#x27;t just because of me.<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> You can&#x27;t deny you&#x27;re the one who defeated all those aradama today, can you?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Somehow, I just felt a little less hesitant today with my swordsmanship.<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> Fu fu fu, don&#x27;t you get it? That&#x27;s the proof of your girl power.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It is!?<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> Yep. Now that your girl power&#x27;s gone up, I&#x27;m sure you won&#x27;t lose to any aradama. Be confident in yourself, Kiyoka.<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> A girl full of confidence is the strongest there is.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Now that you mention it, attractive girls always seem to have a lot of confidence, don&#x27;t they.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Thank you for all you&#x27;ve done for me, Fuu-san.<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> Hm? What do you mean?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You gave me all that encouragement to help me feel confident in myself.<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> Ahaha-, you noticed, huh?<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> (She caught my interest for some reason, so I might&#x27;ve gone overboard with getting in her business.)<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> Did I overdo it a little?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Fufu, only when you made girl power sound so all powerful. But, I was very glad for your help.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I think I&#x27;ll keep working towards bringing up my girl power from now on!<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> Mmhm. That&#x27;s the spirit.

<strong>Mihono:</strong> The more aradama there are, the higher Fukki&#x27;s motivation meter goes up.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Oh yeah, we should all get something to eat after this.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> I don&#x27;t see why not. We got unlucky with our timing and missed a chance to have lunch.<br>

<strong>Kofuki:</strong> It&#x27;s hot out, so let&#x27;s just stay at the lounge here.<br>

<strong>Mihono:</strong> ? Kiyoka, are you feeling sick maybe? ...Are you okay?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Eh.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah... I&#x27;m not feeling sick or anything. I just kind of had something on my mind.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> We were talking about, if we can&#x27;t come up with anything else, let&#x27;s eat a late lunch in the lounge here.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I think eating in the lounge is fine. They just added a new menu a couple days ago too.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Then, that&#x27;s that! Let&#x27;s get going!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Sigh...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Your chopsticks are hardly moving. If it&#x27;s alright, do you want to talk about what&#x27;s on your mind with me?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I probably should... Is it alright if you hear me out?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> See, next week... I have to go on the workplace experience trip. And I&#x27;ve been worrying and worrying about whether I can do it right...<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> What... that&#x27;s it? Who cares; just do whatever. It&#x27;s not like messing it up&#x27;ll kill you.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Honestly... You&#x27;re so quick to say things like that, Kofuki-san.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> You just worry about stuff too much.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> That&#x27;s enough, Kofuki-chan. Telling her that isn&#x27;t going to help her.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Where will you be going for your workplace experience, Musumi Kiyoka?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It&#x27;s a hotel, or, a ryokan. I&#x27;m meant to be working as a hostess... and I&#x27;m feeling a little hopeless about it now.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Wait, really? If you&#x27;re going to a ryokan, you&#x27;d get to eat yummy food and stuff, so isn&#x27;t that pretty lucky?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Mihocchi...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Even if it&#x27;s only just for that day... If only I could turn into Hono-chan...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Even if you can&#x27;t be Asakura Mihono, it&#x27;s important that you take a positive outlook like she has.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Instead of setting out to do all of your work perfectly, why not just aim to do the tasks you want to do well on properly?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> I agree. I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ll be asking for students getting workplace experience to be perfect at their jobs.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> So I hope, while you&#x27;re working, you can find something you have fun with and that makes you want to keep at it.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I&#x27;ll try thinking about how to have fun with it like Hono-chan would.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> So wait; it kinda feels like I helped?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You did, so thanks.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> You&#x27;re welcome then!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="hostess---kiyoka-end-hopefully-it-goes-well"></a>[Hostess - Kiyoka: End]: Hopefully it Goes Well<a class="hash-link" href="#hostess---kiyoka-end-hopefully-it-goes-well" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Umm, this meal was for the room to the left of the one before--<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> H-Help me, Kiyokaaaaaaaaa!!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...Hyau!? What&#x27;s the matter, Hono-chan!?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> The food I was making turned into an aradama!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> What do I do!?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ehh!? Why did it do that!? First... W-W-W-We have to calm down...!?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...Right! We use our okatana at times like these!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Oh yeah, our okatana!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> This&#x27;ll do it... in a jiffy!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Wait, Hono-chan! You&#x27;re holding a fire extinguisher!!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> SHHUU---!!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah, everything&#x27;s gone all white!?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> SHHUU---!!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I can&#x27;t see the aradama! Stop it, Hono-chan!!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> S-Stop doing that-!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...Oh, huh. It was a dream... Sighh... Thank goodness.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That weird dream was probably because I keep thinking about the workplace experience. I was even with Hono-chan, even though we&#x27;re from different schools.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Maybe I shouldn&#x27;t have set the AC to shut off on a timer either.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Let&#x27;s turn the AC on and go back to sleep.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> So then, I thought I was in the middle of my workplace experience, but at the end... You were shooting a fire extinguisher, and everything went white. It was such a weird dream.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> And it woke me up and I couldn&#x27;t get back to sleep last night. It gave me a lot of trouble.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> So that&#x27;s why you were yawning before. But still, I know it&#x27;s a dream, but none of that made any sense.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It&#x27;s all your fault, Hono-chan-. I mean, how did you turn food into aradama?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> How am I supposed to know! That was the just me from your dream!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Fufu, sorry. By the way, where did you go for your workplace experience, Hono-chan?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> For my one, I went to a kindergarten. But it was pretty fun! I got to play around with the kids, and take a nap.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You seem like you&#x27;d be really good at working with kids, after all.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah. We got along great. They told me to come back again, but I&#x27;m too busy with missions to stop by.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...It&#x27;d be a little hard to fit in, wouldn&#x27;t it.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah, with school and missions and all. Maybe if I could take time off from class, but there&#x27;s no way they&#x27;d let me.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> When you do your workplace experience in 2 days, it might be hard on you, but give it your best shot. I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll have fun with it.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Sure! I hope I&#x27;ll get to have as much fun as you did, Hono-chan.  </p><div class="videoWrapper"><iframe width="640" height="480" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tNOrmUo4s64"></iframe></div><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="misogi---kiyoka-start-ill-protect-you"></a>[Misogi - Kiyoka: Start]: I&#x27;ll Protect You!<a class="hash-link" href="#misogi---kiyoka-start-ill-protect-you" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>--This was something that happened on a mission a few months ago.</p><p><strong>Kofuki:</strong> This&#x27;s the best!

<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Shut up! These&#x27;re all mine!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> You&#x27;re getting too excited!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> (Losing control of Shichinosato Kofuki will hurt us. Asakura Mihono is...)<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Geez, there&#x27;s way too manyyy! I chop one... and another... and there&#x27;s just... more!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> (She still has strength left. What about Musumi Kiyoka?)<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> [pant... pant...!]<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> (...So Musumi Kiyoka is reaching her limit.)<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> ...Could we talk for a moment, Setouchi Chie?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Please listen to me, Setouchi Chie.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> ...Eh-- Ah, what?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Asakura Mihono and I will move to concentrate the aradama around Shichinosato Kofuki.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Please move with Musumi Kiyoka in a direction with less aradama.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> ...If that&#x27;s the plan, then Kiyoka-chan and I will go with you. The three of you can&#x27;t handle this many aradama on your own.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> ...You and Musumi Kiyoka are showing heavy signs of fatigue.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> This is expected to be a lengthy mission. So please recover your stamina for now.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> We can manage this fine.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> ...Alright. I&#x27;ll look after Kiyoka-chan.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I&#x27;ll leave her to you.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> ...Follow after me, Asakura Mihono! We&#x27;re taking out the aradama that escape from Shichinosato Kofuki!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Okay!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> ......! HAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> ...That should be the last of the aradama around here... I think? Are you okay, Kiyoka-chan?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I&#x27;m almost exhausted from fighting on and on, but... I didn&#x27;t get hurt or anything.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...How do you think Hono-chan and them are doing?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Mirja-san is with them, so I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re alright. So, just rest a little... When you get your energy back, we can go help them out, okay?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> With all those aradama, we&#x27;re probably going to have to fight some more... Do you think we can meet up with them alright?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Don&#x27;t worry. Your onee-san will keep you safe.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...When you say that, it feels like it&#x27;ll really be okay.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> But... sorry... right now... I need some...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Chie-san?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> [pant... pant... pant...]<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You&#x27;re burning up!?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> (She was fighting like this... Chie-san really is incredible.)<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...No, that&#x27;s not it. It&#x27;s because I&#x27;m so weak... Chie-san had to push herself so hard for me...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Ki... yoka... chan?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...Don&#x27;t overwork yourself, Chie-san. I&#x27;ll try my best.<br>

<strong>Chie:</strong> Kiyoka-chan, thanks for protecting me. I&#x27;m feeling better after a little rest, so I can fight too now.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...Let me feel your forehead for a second.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Eh?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> ...Your hand feels nice and cool, Kiyoka-chan.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> The reason it feels nice is because you still have a fever!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> ...Ah.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Do you understand? No matter what you say, Chie-san, I&#x27;m going to protect you until we meet up with everyone!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Are you listening!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> ...I am. Then, please look after me, Kiyoka-chan.<br>

<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah! There&#x27;s Kiyoka and Chii-nee!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah, everyone...!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I&#x27;m glad to see the both of you are safe. Setouchi Chie, how are you feeling?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> ...Could you tell I had a fever?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I can&#x27;t tell that much.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> But, you were clearly responding sluggishly. I decided something had to be wrong and focused the aradama on us.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> You had one!? I didn&#x27;t notice at all!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> I&#x27;m your onee-san. I can&#x27;t go making you worry about me, can I?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> And, I had Kiyoka-chan making sure I was safe, so I was absolutely fine.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> [crying]...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Kiyoka-chan!? Why are you crying!?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Was it that scary being off alone with Chichie!?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That&#x27;s not it... Since Chie-san wasn&#x27;t feeling well, I-I had to protect her... When it was over, I felt so relieved... The tears won&#x27;t...<br>

<strong>Hiyori:</strong> I wish they&#x27;d give it a rest this time of year, but they... That kind of thing doesn&#x27;t matter to aradama.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> If only there&#x27;d be a little less...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Have you not been able to go home and see your family in a while, Kiyoka?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Lately... not so much.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> But, and it depends on what comes up, but I think I&#x27;ll be able to go back home for 2 or 3 days during New Year&#x27;s.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> I&#x27;m sure your parents would be glad to see you.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> What about you, Juujou-san?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> I got invited to spend New Year&#x27;s Eve with Kanami, Kaoru, and the rest.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> We talked about going right after that to make our first shrine visit too.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah, we did too. I promised Hono-chan we&#x27;d all go together.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> We still aren&#x27;t sure where we&#x27;re going, but maybe to Hono-chan&#x27;s home.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Oh yeah, Mihono lives at a shrine, doesn&#x27;t she.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I asked Hono-chan and she said she&#x27;d let me try on miko clothing, so I&#x27;m a little excited.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Thinking about it, there&#x27;s not a lot of days left, but I guess we both can&#x27;t wait for New Year&#x27;s.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You&#x27;re right, but... there&#x27;s something I have to do before that...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ? We didn&#x27;t have much homework over winter break, did we?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It&#x27;s cleaning season...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I still have to do a big cleanup of my dorm room...!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> It&#x27;s just cleaning your room; it won&#x27;t be that big a deal.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I&#x27;ve been so busy lately, I haven&#x27;t had time to tidy up...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I still do basic cleaning, of course, but... I just can&#x27;t seem to get around to it.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Alright then. If tomorrow works, do you want me to help you out?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Will you really!?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Sure.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Thanks a lot! That would help so much! I have the day off tomorrow too.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Is it that bad that you have to grab my hands...?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> (Could Kiyoka actually be bad at cleaning...?)<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> With that settled, when we get back to town, why don&#x27;t we go eat something sweet to cheer ourselves up?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> I&#x27;m fine with that.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Great~!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> You&#x27;re just looking for a reason to go eat sweets, aren&#x27;t you?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Actually, the other day, I found a shop that a lot of people are saying serves delicious fruit gratin. I really wanted to try it, but it&#x27;s hard to go there by myself.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> So that&#x27;s why. Then, no point in wasting time here.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="heijou-jersey---kiyoka-end-the-temptations-that-sneak-into-cleaning"></a>[Heijou Jersey - Kiyoka: End]: The Temptations That Sneak into Cleaning!<a class="hash-link" href="#heijou-jersey---kiyoka-end-the-temptations-that-sneak-into-cleaning" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Phew... I think that&#x27;s enough vacuuming to start.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I&#x27;m glad I finished before Juujou-san got here.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Even though she&#x27;s coming to help, I have to do this much first...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Umm... Okay, I have all the cleaning supplies. And enough strings to tie up magazines.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I know! Before we get started, I&#x27;ll change into my jersey.<br>
<strong>Hiyori&#x27;s Voice:</strong> Kiyoka. I&#x27;m here to help out.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah, I&#x27;ll get the door-!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Just from looking around, it doesn&#x27;t seem bad enough you needed somebody else&#x27;s help.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> For the end of the year cleaning, I just need to do things like the windows... The big problem is sorting through all the books and magazines I subscribed to this year.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I can send the books I&#x27;m not going to be reading back home. It&#x27;s just hard to get through all by myself... I really appreciate you being here, Juujou-san.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ? If you&#x27;re just deciding whether you need them or not, you don&#x27;t need me, do you?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> No no no... I&#x27;ll be in big trouble if you&#x27;re not here!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...If you say so?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> For now, let&#x27;s change into our jerseys then get started. I was just about to get changed myself. I don&#x27;t really like getting my uniform dirty when I&#x27;m not on a mission.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> That&#x27;s a good idea. Give me a minute.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Thanks for helping with cleaning the windows too.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> I&#x27;m good at helping with cleaning, so that&#x27;s easy for me. And it&#x27;s over quick when there&#x27;s two people.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Anyway, what&#x27;s that you&#x27;ve been reading?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It&#x27;s the teens&#x27; fashion magazine I always buy...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> That says it&#x27;s the April issue, doesn&#x27;t it...?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Uh, about that... I remembered I bought the skirt the model on the cover is wearing... and then I just started flipping through the pages.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Weren&#x27;t you going to pick out the books you&#x27;re done reading to send home, and tie up the magazines for recycling...? Honestly.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You&#x27;re right... Even if I look back through them at times like these, I can&#x27;t go holding onto them forever.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I really should throw them away every month when I buy a new one, but...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> They come in handy for things like tips on how to coordinate, so it&#x27;s hard to get rid of them.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Let me see those. I&#x27;ll tie up the ones around here.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Please go ahead. I knew this would happen, which is why I wanted you to come.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Don&#x27;t sound so proud about that.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> How&#x27;s it going over there?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Take a look at this, on the corner of this page! Isn&#x27;t this knitted scarf so cute? It looks so soft and fluffy.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> It&#x27;d probably look good on you.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> And then, there&#x27;s this too, I think this chic design would look great on you, Juujou-san!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Once the new year starts, we can make it our first shopping trip... or maybe not. But, we should go take a look together. And we can invite some others too.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Sounds good. There&#x27;s still plenty of time to use a scarf this season.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Wait, forget that... hand that over here too.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> This one&#x27;s this month&#x27;s issue... so I&#x27;m not done with it yet.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Sigh... Then, what should I be doing next?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> The books stacked in front of the bookshelf are going home, so it&#x27;d help if you could put them in those cardboard boxes.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I&#x27;ll look for other books I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be reading.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Got it.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Still, even for paperbacks, there&#x27;s a lot more than I was expecting.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Nn...? This one... Isn&#x27;t this the sequel to the novel you let me borrow before?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> I guess I can take a quick break and take a look...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> This book, I bought it and never got around to reading it. I must have tucked it away here.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I&#x27;ll just take a quick peek to see what it was about...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Wha... It ends like that? Now I&#x27;m even more interested to see what happens next...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> If you want the 3rd volume, I think it was over here...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Here you go.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Sure. Thanks for finding it.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka/Hiyori:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...It&#x27;s been a couple hours and we haven&#x27;t finished sorting anything!?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I can&#x27;t believe it... Even Juujou-san got sucked in, when I called her so this wouldn&#x27;t happen...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Sorry, I couldn&#x27;t help myself... I couldn&#x27;t put the book down.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Let&#x27;s hurry up and finish this. It&#x27;ll be night at this rate.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> No more reading until after we&#x27;re done...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...Yeah, we should be fine with enough self-control. I know it.<br>
