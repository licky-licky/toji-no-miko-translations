Kaoru, you got to see Papa and Mama at their research lab recently, didn&#x27;t you? They had a lot to say about you! They were so happy to meet you!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Yeah. They sure were something. All full of energy.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> They&#x27;re both so busy after all; they don&#x27;t get a lot of free time to talk... Mama especially said she&#x27;s head over heels for you!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Huh.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> When it comes to engineering, Papa and Mama give even Grandpa a run for his money!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Ooh.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> You haven&#x27;t met my grandpa yet, have you? I want to show you how amazing he is already!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Ahh.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> ...Kaoru...? Are you listening?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> I&#x27;m listening. But you keep going on and on about your family. I&#x27;m running out of reactions.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Come on, don&#x27;t be like that! I love my family so much, so I want to share with you all about them~!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> I know, so I&#x27;ll keep listening until you&#x27;re satisfied, okay?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> That&#x27;s what I love about you, Kaoru!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Actually, I&#x27;m going on a trip with my family soon! It&#x27;s been a while since the whole Kohagura family got together! I&#x27;m really looking forward to it!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Papa and Mama said they&#x27;re working extra hard to make sure they get time off for it...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Oh! Speaking of which, Mama&#x27;s calling me now! Mind if I take it?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Go ahead.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Hi Mom! I can&#x27;t wait to see you! ...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> ......Ah............OK...<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> She said the trip had to be postponed.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> I see.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> It&#x27;s not all that surprising though. Papa and Mama have so much to work on lately. This happens a lot.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> In fact, it was a real miracle everyone&#x27;s schedules managed to free up like that! Like all the planets aligned!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> ...........<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> But, it still hurts... I wanted to see them...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Still, I can&#x27;t be selfish.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s all that selfish.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Ah, c&#x27;mon. Cheer up, Ellen. How about instead, on the day you were supposed to go on a trip, I&#x27;ll go along with you to your favorite cake buffet?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Kaoru... You&#x27;re supposed to say &quot;you&#x27;ll take me there&quot;-!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Fine, fine. You can eat as much as you want. Cause you&#x27;re paying.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="2-cake-buffet"></a>2: Cake Buffet<a class="hash-link" href="#2-cake-buffet" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Ellen:</strong> We&#x27;re here... We&#x27;re finally here... The caaaaake buffet---!<br>
<strong>Everyone:</strong> Yay-!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> The pure white cream, the light and fluffy texture, the bright and juicy fruits...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Baked and non-baked, souffle and tarts, there&#x27;s every cake you can imagine! Let&#x27;s charge right in, everyone~!!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Go get your fill.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Eh? Kaoru-chan, are you not having any?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> I&#x27;ll watch our seats. Ellen~, get some coffee for me~.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ellen-chan already raced in ahead of everyone...<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Tch, too late, huh...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Anyway, I&#x27;m going too-!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Ah, hey! That&#x27;s where you&#x27;re supposed to say &quot;Then, I&#x27;ll get your coffee for you~&quot;!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Can I... Eat these...? Any of these...? All of these...?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Mmhm, it&#x27;s fine. Eat whichever you like.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...! ...I can&#x27;t choose...<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Fufu. Then, how about we pick out different types? We can taste each other&#x27;s later.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Who would even want to eat all these sweets to begin with...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Hiyori-chan! There&#x27;s a chocolate mint cake over here!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> What!?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> We&#x27;re back-! Time to eat-!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Whoa!? Ellen-chan&#x27;s surrounded by an army of cakes!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> No, no~! I&#x27;ve maneuvered this army right where I want them!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> There&#x27;s no way someone could that much, is there...?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> A piece of cake! I could have this before breakfast!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> She&#x27;s probably gonna go back two or three times for more.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Th-That&#x27;s really something...<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...Mai. Did we not get enough...?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> N-No, we&#x27;re fine. I think that would be too much for even the two of us together.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Everyone&#x27;s ready, right? So we can start eating? Come on, hurry! Three, two...!<br>
<strong>Everyone:</strong> One-!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Burp...... I-I ate too much... I can&#x27;t move...<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> The cause of defeat was one helping too many.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> I thought I could at least finish one of everything... My greed got the better of me...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Still, I can&#x27;t believe you ate all that! You really love cakes, huh, Ellen-chan~?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Just looking at the satisfaction on her face made me start feeling happier.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> I really enjoyed it too, of course! Eating the cakes I love with the people I love; today I&#x27;m feeling 100% happy!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> ...Just, for a little bit... Let me rest...<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Then I&#x27;ll go get some cake and coffee.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> They&#x27;re probably putting out new cakes around now, in the wake of Ellen&#x27;s rampage~.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> You mean... Were you just waiting around knowing this would happen...?  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="3-a-few-minutes-of-vacation"></a>3: A Few Minutes of Vacation<a class="hash-link" href="#3-a-few-minutes-of-vacation" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Finally, we&#x27;re in Izu.<br>
<strong>Nene:</strong> Ne~!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> And the weather&#x27;s so nice! Though it feels like we could be assigned a mission right away.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Since we&#x27;re here and all, I wanna eat some of Izu&#x27;s specialties. Ellen, do you know any?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> I&#x27;ll look some up on my phone!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> ...Let&#x27;s see... Izu has a lot of fishing ports, so it seems like they sell a lot of dried fish.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> They seem to have a lot of orange farms too. They must love picking oranges.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> That sounds nice.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> And then, they have a local delicacy called &quot;Deep-Fried Dick&quot;, apparently.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...What&#x27;s with that suggestive name?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Seems like they mince up locally caught mackerel and squid, add vegetables like carrots, onions, and burdock, mix it all together, and fry it in oil.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Sounds delicious... I wanna eat it, but it&#x27;ll be embarrassing to order.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> You&#x27;re lewd, Kaoru.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> You&#x27;re the one who said it first.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> I just said what it&#x27;s called~.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Oh! Sana-sensei&#x27;s calling! Hello, what is it?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> ...Eh? An emergency assignment? So Kanamin and Hiyoyon made it to Izu, and we&#x27;re supposed to meet up with and test them?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Well there goes our Izu sightseeing tour. Only got a few minutes out of it.<br>
<strong>Nene:</strong> Ne~...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> There&#x27;s no helping it. Accepting those two is more important than us getting a day off.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Oh yeah, so what about the investigation team?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> We just have to trust they can take care of themselves.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> We have to focus on our own mission, after all.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...Man. After this is over, I want a long vacation.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="4-vision-of-the-future"></a>4: Vision of the Future<a class="hash-link" href="#4-vision-of-the-future" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Ellen:</strong> Hiii-! Myaako-! I&#x27;m stopping by!<br>
<strong>Sasano Miyako:</strong> ...You again. You sure come here a lot.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Yes! Is it okay if I check out some of the data from the research department?<br>
<strong>Miyako:</strong> That&#x27;s fine. If you want to continue what you were reading last time, it&#x27;s on the shelf over there.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Thanks as always!<br>
<strong>Miyako:</strong> ...Do you keep it a secret from your partner that you come here?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Partner? You mean Kaoru?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> I invite her every time, but of course she always refuses, saying it &quot;Sounds lame~&quot;.<br>
<strong>Miyako:</strong> I see. But isn&#x27;t that normal?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> I guess? I think Kaoru gets a little abnormally annoyed with everything though~.<br>
<strong>Miyako:</strong> Well, you have a real passion for researching developments into new anti-aradama technology.<br>
<strong>Miyako:</strong> Especially &quot;suppression methods that don&#x27;t involve the use of toji&quot;. I don&#x27;t think many toji in active duty would have such an interest in that field.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Miyako:</strong> Do you really hate fighting that much? Or does this... Have something to do with Mokusa?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> ...Myaako. No matter how alone we are, that&#x27;s being too careless.<br>
<strong>Miyako:</strong> You&#x27;re right. I&#x27;m sorry.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> I&#x27;m really glad I could be a toji. I have the strength to keep everyone safe and happy, after all.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> But a toji&#x27;s power doesn&#x27;t last forever. I won&#x27;t always be able to go on like this.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> So when my power fades, I want to take the path of an engineer like my esteemed papa and mama.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> With an okatana now, and with technology someday. That&#x27;s how I&#x27;ll always be able to continue fighting to protect people!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Coming here is just laying the groundwork for that. So if I had to say, my research here is for my own benefit.<br>
<strong>Miyako:</strong> ...That&#x27;s unexpected. I didn&#x27;t think you considered those things.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> It&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve told anyone about it too! I&#x27;m feeling sort of embarrassed...<br>
<strong>Miyako:</strong> Really? I see you in a different light now.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Ooh! If it made Myaako fall for me all over again, then it was worth revealing.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Though, saying all that, no one knows what could happen in the future.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> It might be that, somehow, I end up being the first ever lifetime toji, you know!<br>
<strong>Miyako:</strong> Who can say.<br>
<strong>Miyako:</strong> ...By the way, there were some interesting results in yesterday&#x27;s incident report. Want to take a look?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Of course!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="5-the-fighting-toji-san"></a>5: The Fighting Toji-san<a class="hash-link" href="#5-the-fighting-toji-san" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Kagami Mimi:</strong> Ah, it&#x27;s Ellen~!

<strong>Mimi:</strong> Yeah! All done~! Hey, Ellen, will you play with me again today?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Sure thing~! What&#x27;d you have in mind?<br>
<strong>Mimi:</strong> Awesome-! I thought we could play samurai-!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> But you&#x27;re so strong, Mimimin-! Last time I was defeated... But this time, I&#x27;ll show you my true power!<br>
<strong>Mimi:</strong> Ahaha! You always say that, but you always end up losing!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Fufufu... Don&#x27;t make the mistake of comparing me to last time...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> ---!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> (My spectrum finder picked something up... It&#x27;s right near the school...)<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Sorry, Mimimin-! Seems like I have some toji work to do. We can settle this later, okay?<br>
<strong>Mimi:</strong> Ehh-!?<br>
<strong>Mimi:</strong> Ah, then I&#x27;ll go with you! With both of us together, we can beat that aradama in no time!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> That&#x27;s a great idea. But this is work for your onee-san. It&#x27;s still a bit too early for you, Mimimin.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> The aradama&#x27;s close by, so don&#x27;t leave the school. Promise me that, okay?<br>
<strong>Mimi:</strong> &#x27;Kay...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Then, I&#x27;m going! I&#x27;ll be right back-!<br>
<strong>Mimi:</strong> ...But that&#x27;s so boring. I figured Ellen would have said it&#x27;s fine for me to go...<br>
<strong>Mimi:</strong> I know~. I&#x27;ll sneak out and beat the aradama.<br>
<strong>Mimi:</strong> She said not to, but I bet Ellen&#x27;ll be so surprised and praise me a lot~!<br>
<strong>Mimi:</strong> ...Ah, Ellen&#x27;s over there! Which means that bad aradama must be around too...<br>

<strong>Mimi:</strong> N-No...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Didn&#x27;t you hear me say not to come?<br>
<strong>Mimi:</strong> ...! Sor-I&#x27;m sorry...!<br>
<strong>Mimi:</strong> I do so good in practice, so I thought I could fight already... But I couldn&#x27;t move a muscle...<br>
<strong>Mimi:</strong> I&#x27;m sorry, Ellen. Sorry I broke my promise. Please don&#x27;t hate me...!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Don&#x27;t cry, Mimimin. I could never hate you.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> I was just really worried. I&#x27;m glad you&#x27;re safe.<br>

<strong>Ellen:</strong> But it&#x27;s also a part of the season here in Japan. It&#x27;s fun waiting around in all the commotion.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> And here I thought I&#x27;d get to laze around at home through New Year&#x27;s-.<br>
<strong>Nene:</strong> Nene-!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mai... You don&#x27;t have to hold my hand anymore. I won&#x27;t get lost.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Ah, that&#x27;s right. Sorry, I&#x27;ve been holding on all this time.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> It&#x27;s okay... Your hand was warm.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Hey, Hiyori-chan, what&#x27;d you pray for?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> To be in good health. What about you?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Well, to meet more strong toji this year! That&#x27;s what I wished for.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> That sounds like something you&#x27;d do, but I guess there&#x27;s nothing wrong with it.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> What should we do now? We could draw fortune slips, or get sweet sake; or a whole bunch of things!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Since I&#x27;m here at the shrine, I thought I would buy some protective charms for my family, then bring them back home.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> That sounds nice too. Hmm, I can&#x27;t make up my mind. Isn&#x27;t there some kind of special event you do at New Year&#x27;s?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> It&#x27;s not really an event, but what if we do that?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah! We could play hanetsuki! 	[Hanetsuki is a game similar to badminton, traditionally played at New Year&#x27;s]<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Looks like fun! Let&#x27;s do it!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> I&#x27;ll pass. You can have fun on your--<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Don&#x27;t you know, Eternal? Playing hanetsuki is considered an act of prayer for a girl&#x27;s development.<br>
<strong>Nene:</strong> Ne~?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...!!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> You sure you want to miss out? I guess it&#x27;s only just a prayer, after all-.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> So then, Kanamin and I will be playing?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Wait, I&#x27;m playing too...!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> ......Heh.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> If Hiyori-chan feels like playing, then I&#x27;ll be the referee.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...What will you do, Mai?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Let&#x27;s see... I&#x27;ll go pick out protective charms while I still can. If I let too much time go by, I think it&#x27;ll be too crowded.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Then, I&#x27;ll go too.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Okay. Let&#x27;s get going then. We&#x27;re going to go buy some charms for a bit, okay?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah, alright! We&#x27;ll see you later, Mai-chan, Sayaka-chan.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Getting to compete with Hiyoyon like this is making me excited. I&#x27;m not about to lose, okay-?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> I don&#x27;t plan on losing either.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> You can do it-. &#x27;Cause I&#x27;ll be cheering for you-.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Kaoru, please cheer for me too-!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Yeah, you can do it too, Ellen-.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Give it your best shot, you two~!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Hiyoyon, here I go-? Let&#x27;s start! There-!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="new-years-ellen-end-fun-together"></a>[New Year&#x27;s Ellen: End]: Fun Together!<a class="hash-link" href="#new-years-ellen-end-fun-together" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> HA-!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Not bad, Hiyoyon! HO-!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> That&#x27;s crazy! They&#x27;ve been going for so long now. Other people who came to the shrine are starting to watch too.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Yep, that&#x27;s Hiyori alright. It&#x27;s like she&#x27;s becoming one with the hagoita. [Flat paddle used in hanetsuki]<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Kaoru... Could you... Shut up-!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> How about this? HA-!!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...Kh!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> That settles it; Ellen-chan&#x27;s the winner.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> I did it! Hanetsuki&#x27;s pretty fun~, isn&#x27;t it.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> As a rule, you&#x27;re supposed to draw on the loser with black ink, but we haven&#x27;t got any. Too bad...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> That reminds me, did you know about this?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> The hagoita is a tool you use for hanetsuki, but, a long time ago, it seems like it was customary to give them to girls on New Year&#x27;s, as a charm to ward off misfortune.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Huh-, so hagoita used to be used like that.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> So, Kanamin and Kaoru, are you going to be playing next?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Nah, I&#x27;m good.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ehh-. Kaoru-chan-, come on-.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Visiting a crowded shrine like this takes way more out of you than I expected. That&#x27;s why, I&#x27;ve got to preserve my stamina, just in case.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah, then to make up for it, we can have a match together some other time! Then I can spar against you, Kaoru-chan! Would that work?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Oi, why do we have to make up for it... Fine, I&#x27;ll think about it. But only think about it.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> We&#x27;re back. Are you all taking a break?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Yeah. Or, actually, we might be done now.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> You&#x27;re done... playing hanetsuki?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> If you two feel like playing, then we can keep going. What do you think, Saaya?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> I&#x27;m... fine with not playing.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I agree, I think I&#x27;m fine not playing too.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> In that case, next up, should we all go draw our fortune slips for the year?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ellen-chan, let&#x27;s go check out the food stands after that!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> I was just thinking the same thing, Kanamin! You and I are on the same page.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Me too... I&#x27;m looking forward to the food stands.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ehehe. It&#x27;s kind of nice, isn&#x27;t it? Doing this kind of thing. I hope we can all have a lot more fun again this year-.<br>

<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Actually, you guys haven&#x27;t finished up the barbecue yet, have you?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> No problem. We still have plenty of ingredients left-. You and Nene can both eat your fill.<br>
<strong>Nene:</strong> Ne-!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Ooh, you&#x27;ve got some pretty good meat here. You really went all out.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> That&#x27;s the beef that Mihomiho brought. She said she used all her spending money!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Is that so. Though, I&#x27;m not seeing Mihono herself around?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Mihono-chan and Kiyoka-chan are taking a little break after eating...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Naonao, could you save the meat you&#x27;re grilling now for Kaoru?<br>
<strong>Uraga Nao:</strong> Sure thing. The hard workers among us need to make sure to get enough nourishment~.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> The president must have me confused for a workhorse or something. She doesn&#x27;t even give me carrots either...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> We have carrots here. Go on and eat up-.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> No way; let me get some meat first!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Fufu, I&#x27;m only joking. Here you go, ready to eat. You can have a drink too.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Ohh, I sorta feel bad making you getting everything for me. Why&#x27;re you doing all this anyway?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Isn&#x27;t it simply that she&#x27;s happy you&#x27;re here, Kaoru-san?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Hey, Chie-, don&#x27;t tell her that-.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> You quit looking at me too, Kaoru. Your meat&#x27;s getting cold.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Then, I&#x27;ll dig in. --Ohm!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Sho good...!? I&#x27;ve gotta give Mihono my thanks.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> That&#x27;s the meat we all fought to get back from the aradama. So go ahead and savor it.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> You&#x27;ve been working hard too, huh. [chew chew]...<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> I wish this kind of R&amp;R would get turned into one of my duties too.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> That&#x27;s for sure-. We could all go have fun at lots of different places.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Ah, you should try the ones she grilled slow at low temperature too.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> I guess I&#x27;ll have some of that then.<br>
<strong>Nene:</strong> Nene-!<br>
<strong>Nao:</strong> Not yet~. These ones need to cook a little longer. Understand~?<br>
<strong>Nene:</strong> Ne...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> The barbecue boss&#x27;s orders are absolute, Kaoru.<br>

<strong>Ellen:</strong> That&#x27;s definitely one way to enjoy it-.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> The smell when it&#x27;s grilling&#x27;s good too.<br>

<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Skewers are ready; you want one, Ellen?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong>  Nnn... Getting up&#x27;s too much work. I wonder if I caught this from you, Kaoru?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Since we&#x27;re always together, it must have only been a matter of time.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Don&#x27;t blame me if you&#x27;re turning into a slacker. I&#x27;m the one wanting to slack off here.<br>

<strong>Kaoru:</strong> I&#x27;m not so sure about that. Here, it&#x27;s hot, so be careful.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Thank you. You cooked it nicely.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> It&#x27;s not fun, but cooking&#x27;s nothing much-.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> You really brought the flavor out, Kaoru.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Anybody could do it if they tried.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...Or maybe not. The stuff Nao cooked was really good.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> [chew chew]... But, I like it this way.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Well, that&#x27;s good to hear then.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Ahh... Now that I&#x27;ve had my fill, I&#x27;m getting sleepy too.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Want to take a nap with me? They say &quot;a sleeping child is a growing child&quot;.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Don&#x27;t you think you&#x27;ve already grown enough?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Actually, I&#x27;m still in the middle of my growing phase.<br>

<strong>Kaoru:</strong> You&#x27;re gonna get even bigger!?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> So this&#x27;s what they call a dangerously stratified society...<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> But, back to what you were saying. An afternoon nap doesn&#x27;t sound too bad. I wish I had the spare time to take one every day.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Agreed. Kaoru, don&#x27;t go pushing yourself too hard, alright-?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> You know that&#x27;s not up to me-. I&#x27;d do everything I can to get out of it.<br>

<strong>Nene:</strong> Nee...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Kaoru, Nene, there&#x27;s not much left to do, so let&#x27;s try our best! After this mission&#x27;s over, there&#x27;s my Papa and Mama&#x27;s countdown party waiting for us!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Yeah, that&#x27;s right. The luxury party they rented out a huge room at a high class hotel for.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> With delicious food, and all the amazing sweets you could want! So let&#x27;s finish this mission quick, so we can make it in time for the party.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Well, it&#x27;s true that, after all the work we&#x27;ve done, you&#x27;d want spend at least the very end of the year getting treated for it.<br>
<strong>Nene:</strong> Ne-!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Sigh... I can&#x27;t do any more after this. There can&#x27;t be any more of them, right?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> You did great! It seems we cleared out the aradama, so that means this year&#x27;s missions are finally complete!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> If we race back to the party now, we should make it in time for the countdown! Let&#x27;s hurry!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Nobody&#x27;s here...<br>
<strong>Nene:</strong> Nee...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Apparently the party ended while we were stuck in traffic. Sorry to disappoint you, Kaoru.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Nah, it&#x27;s fine. This is just how things go for us cogs in the system... It&#x27;s actually the perfect New Year&#x27;s for drones like us. Come on, might as well go home and go to bed.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Hold on a moment! Over there, there&#x27;s one table with food still laid out!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Ohh, you&#x27;re right! Don&#x27;t tell me they left it for us?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> That&#x27;s what it looks like. There&#x27;s a message card from Papa and Mama, and a New Year&#x27;s Present too.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Present? This envelope done up in a ribbon? What&#x27;s inside?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> It&#x27;s a keycard.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> A keycard? And where does that get us into?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Fufu. That&#x27;s something you can look forward to finding out later!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Anyway, Kaoru, we might not have made it in time for the countdown, but let&#x27;s celebrate New Year&#x27;s.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Let&#x27;s start with a toast! Kaoru, Nene, thanks so much for everything this past year. I&#x27;m looking forward to spending the next year with you too.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Cheers!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Fwah, I&#x27;m stuffed. My stomach&#x27;s too full to move anymore.<br>
<strong>Nene:</strong> Nee...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> I&#x27;m glad it put you back in a better mood!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> I just got a message from Kanamin. Wow! So she and Hiyoyon went and did their first shrine visit. Take a look, Kaoru; they look like they&#x27;re having fun in this picture.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Hahah... Those are some nice smiles. Look at them, enjoying their New Year&#x27;s break.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> There&#x27;s more too. &quot;We&#x27;re going to the mountaintop now to see the first sunrise. Do you and Kaoru-chan want to join us?&quot;<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> The first sunrise... Sorry, but I&#x27;m dead after that mission, and, after eating that much, I don&#x27;t have it in me to go out again.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Besides, I&#x27;m not even sure I can stay up till sunrise. And there&#x27;s just no way I&#x27;m climbing up a mountain and sitting in the cold until it comes up.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Seriously, the timing this year&#x27;s been the worst right out the gate.<br>

<strong>Kanami:</strong> Someplace nice? Hiyori-chan, don&#x27;t you want to go see!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Why not. Since she asked us to call off our plans to see the sunrise, whatever it is must be something amazing.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> We&#x27;re here!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> And where&#x27;s &quot;here&quot;...?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> The members-only lounge on the hotel&#x27;s top floor! The sunrise you can see from up here is very beautiful.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> So that&#x27;s why. It&#x27;s hard to tell since it&#x27;s still night out, but I&#x27;m sure a floor this high gets a good view of it.<br>

<strong>Ellen:</strong> It&#x27;s still going to take a while, so let&#x27;s have some tea while we wait! Here, Kaoru, some warm milk tea for you.<br>

<strong>Ellen:</strong> To make the world a better place-!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> .........Huh?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> We&#x27;re on vacation and there&#x27;s still aradama-!?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Kaoru-! One&#x27;s going your way!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> &quot;One&#x27;s going your way~&quot; Come on! I only came with cause you said we were going on a trip to Hokkai... do!!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> And we are here in Hokkai... do!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Phew, that was the last of them now. Nene? Could you strike a pose there... like, &quot;I beat the aradama!&quot;<br>
<strong>Nene:</strong> Ne-!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> That&#x27;s perfect-! You&#x27;re looking cool, Nene!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...Is that a sketchbook? What&#x27;re you doing now?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Please give me some quiet here, Kaoru! Nene, be sure not to move, okay?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...Well, I&#x27;m fine with whatever so long as I get a break. Though...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> She still sucks at drawing, huh. I can&#x27;t even tell what that&#x27;s supposed to be.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="ceremonial-dress-misogi---ellen-end-ive-done-it"></a>[Ceremonial Dress Misogi - Ellen: End]: I&#x27;ve Done It!<a class="hash-link" href="#ceremonial-dress-misogi---ellen-end-ive-done-it" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Ellen:</strong> It&#x27;s Okinawa-!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Nobody told me we were making a 2 days 1 night trip across Japan...<br>
<strong>Nene:</strong> Ne-...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Didn&#x27;t I tell you we were on a trip to make the world a better place?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Just going to Hokkaido is enough of a trip! And, what&#x27;s the deal with drawing Nene doing weird poses everywhere?<br>
<strong>Nene:</strong> Nenenene!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Fu fu fu. That I can&#x27;t even tell you about yet, Kaoru. You can look forward to it when we get back.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Is that how it is. So, where&#x27;re we going this time? You looked up stuff for Okinawa too, didn&#x27;t you?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Unfortunately, there wasn&#x27;t any news on aradama in Okinawa. So, let&#x27;s go to a Ryukyu karate dojo!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...What happened to making the world a better place?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Aghh... Ahh... This sucks; you didn&#x27;t say anything about training on the beach...<br>
<strong>Nene:</strong> Nee... Neee...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> You&#x27;re never going to get your black belt if that&#x27;s enough to make you call it quits! You both need more training, Kaoru, Nene!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ve never said I wanted a black belt.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...But you seem pretty good at this, Ellen. Were you doing Ryukyu karate on top of Taisha-ryu or something?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Yes! It&#x27;s just something I picked up in the past.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Where&#x27;d you pick that up?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Huh, didn&#x27;t I tell you? A little bit before we met, I was here in Okinawa.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Ahh... That sounds familiar, come to think of it. You were helping with that what&#x27;s-it-called development place, right?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> The Special Rare Metals Applications Research Institute. I was a test operator for storm armor there.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> So then, you must&#x27;ve been living around here, huh...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Yes! I know tons of great places to eat too!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Now that sounds good. Take me somewhere you recommend.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Sure thing! There&#x27;s so many places I want to take you to, I can&#x27;t settle for just one!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Hmm, hm hm hm hm hmm~. Hm hm hm hmhm, hmm~! ...It&#x27;s done!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> It sure comes out differently after you&#x27;ve seen it firsthand! Okay then... Now to upload!<br>
<strong>Comment 1:</strong> This week it&#x27;s the tanuki&#x27;s big adventure?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> ...So making a manga didn&#x27;t work either? I thought I drew it pretty well too...<br>
<strong>???:</strong> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a tanuki or what, but I really like how that little guy worked so hard to beat the aradama.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Ah......!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> I-I&#x27;ve done it----------!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> I-I&#x27;ve done it----------!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Seriously, if she&#x27;s drawing a manga, she could&#x27;ve just said so. Right?<br>
<strong>Nene:</strong> Nene!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Kaoru-! Come over here for a minute-!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> What do you want; it&#x27;s late. I was going to bed, y&#x27;know?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> This is a huge deal!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Can you believe her...?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Nn?<br>
<strong>Comment:</strong> The art&#x27;s not great, but I like it a lot too.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...Dang. Guess I didn&#x27;t have to go and do that after all.<br>

<strong>Police PR Official:</strong> From here, we&#x27;d like you to help with each of the other departments, so could you go see what the traffic department needs, Kohagura-san?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> I&#x27;m on it!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> I&#x27;m Kohagura Ellen, here to help! I&#x27;ll be in your care!<br>
<strong>Traffic Officer:</strong> That&#x27;s a nice upbeat attitude! Then, if I could get right to it, I&#x27;ll explain what we need your help with.<br>
<strong>Traffic Officer:</strong> There&#x27;s a lot of cars parking on the streets around here, so we&#x27;re stepping up our regulation of parking violations. Do you think you could come around as my assistant today?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Sure thing!<br>
<strong>Traffic Officer:</strong> Ah, looks like I&#x27;ve already spotted a parking violation there. Let&#x27;s go over.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Okay! I see, so that&#x27;s a parking ticket.<br>
<strong>Traffic Officer:</strong> If you get one of these, you&#x27;ll have to pay a fine and points get deducted from your license. There&#x27;s no good that comes from it.<br>
<strong>Driver:</strong> Ah-! Hang on a minute! I was only parked here for a second, so could you overlook it?<br>
<strong>Traffic Officer:</strong> Sorry, but those are the rules. There&#x27;s signs that clearly state this is a no parking zone.<br>
<strong>Driver:</strong> I was back in no time though; I just had to do a little shopping. Was I bothering anybody?<br>
<strong>Traffic Officer:</strong> This is a vital location in case an emergency vehicle needs to make a stop here. Even if you weren&#x27;t here for long, it still isn&#x27;t allowed.<br>
<strong>Driver:</strong> Tch... You want to fill your quota that bad? You&#x27;re just tax thieves! Who do you think&#x27;s paying your salaries.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Traffic Officer:</strong> Okay, thanks for your cooperation. Please drive safely now.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> They just left...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> I can&#x27;t believe how rude they were! They&#x27;re the ones who broke the rules, so how can they act like that...<br>
<strong>Traffic Officer:</strong> It&#x27;s just the way it is. We hear that stuff all the time, so I&#x27;m fine with it, but are you alright, Kohagura-san?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> I&#x27;m fine. It was kind of a sucker punch, but... I can tell just what you police officers have to go through.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> ......?<br>
<strong>Traffic Officer:</strong> What&#x27;s wrong? Did you notice something?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Just now, I thought I saw somebody watching us from behind that building...<br>
<strong>Traffic Officer:</strong> Oh dear, do you think it&#x27;s trouble?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> I must have imagined it. Anyway, we have a job to do!<br>
<strong>Traffic Officer:</strong> We managed to crack down on a lot of cars in such a short period of time. You&#x27;ve been a real help, Kohagura-san, since you catch on so quick.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Thanks a lot. Though, I&#x27;m surprised how whenever we give someone a ticket, they&#x27;re always so insulting to us.<br>
<strong>Traffic Officer:</strong> From their perspective, we&#x27;re more like sworn enemies coming out of nowhere to hit them with a fine.<br>
they&#x27;re suddenly getting hit with a fine, </p><p><strong>Traffic Officer:</strong> But, even if they hate us for it, we have to keep the town safe around here.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> It sure sounds like a tough job... Hm...? I think someone&#x27;s watching us after all...<br>
<strong>Traffic Officer:</strong> I could tell just now too. Like someone&#x27;s watching from behind the trees on the side of the road...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Someone stubbornly watching us from afar. I wonder who would do that...  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="police-officer---ellen-end-the-source-of-the-suspicious-gaze"></a>[Police Officer - Ellen: End]: The Source of the Suspicious Gaze...<a class="hash-link" href="#police-officer---ellen-end-the-source-of-the-suspicious-gaze" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Ellen:</strong> Do you think it&#x27;s maybe someone holding a grudge against us for giving them a ticket...?<br>
<strong>Traffic Officer:</strong> I can&#x27;t deny the possibility. But, even if someone holds a grudge against us, we&#x27;re just doing our job.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> That&#x27;s right! I&#x27;ll do what I can to help out too. And, if it comes down to it, I&#x27;ll keep you safe too.<br>
<strong>Traffic Officer:</strong> I feel safer already.<br>
<strong>Traffic Officer:</strong> ...! They&#x27;re watching us again! From inside that car this time.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> In a car? Which one?<br>
<strong>Traffic Officer:</strong> There, the car that just stopped at the parking lot on the corner...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Wait, that car...!?<br>
<strong>Traffic Officer:</strong> We&#x27;d better not wait for them to try anything; let&#x27;s question the driver.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Wow! Please hang on a minute! I know that car...!<br>
<strong>Traffic Officer:</strong> Could I have a word with you, sir?<br>
<strong>Traffic Officer:</strong> Can you tell us what you were doing parking your car here?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Wow! I knew it! I&#x27;m sorry about all this, officer!<br>
<strong>Traffic Officer:</strong> What&#x27;s wrong, Kohagura-san? What are you apologizing for?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> This is my...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Grandpa!<br>
<strong>Traffic Officer:</strong> Grandpa... He&#x27;s your grandfather!?<br>
<strong>Friedman:</strong> I am. Nice to meet you. I&#x27;m Ellen&#x27;s grandfather, Richard Friedman.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Grandpa, what are you doing here!?<br>
<strong>Friedman:</strong> I was having a look at you on your police duty.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Were you also the one watching us from behind the building before too?<br>
<strong>Traffic Officer:</strong> And from behind the trees by the side of the road...?<br>
<strong>Friedman:</strong> That was me. I thought that I shouldn&#x27;t go coming up to talk to you while you were working.<br>
<strong>Traffic Officer:</strong> Is that all it was... That&#x27;s good to hear, right, Kohagura-san?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> It&#x27;s a relief, but...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Don&#x27;t go doing something so misleading, Grandpa!<br>
<strong>Friedman:</strong> Sorry, sorry. Though, I have to say, Ellen, you look very good in that police uniform.<br>
<strong>Friedman:</strong> And you were on top of your work too; it was like watching a real police officer go about their business.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Grandpa...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> But still, secretly peeping on someone is against the rules!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> If you do that again, I&#x27;m giving you a ticket, Grandpa!<br>
<strong>Friedman:</strong> Now that would be bad. I&#x27;ll get permission beforehand next time.</p></div><footer class="docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="row"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations/edit/docs/episodes/Kohagura_Ellen_Episodes.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_2_ui" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_13-_"></div></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/tnm-translations/docs/episodes/Mashiko_Kaoru_Episodes/"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Â« Mashiko Kaoru Episodes</div></a></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/tnm-translations/docs/episodes/Origami_Yukari_Episodes/"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Next</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Origami Yukari Episodes Â»</div></a></div></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_35-E thin-scrollbar"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#1-i-miss-you" class="table-of-contents__link">1: I Miss You</a></li><li><a href="#2-cake-buffet" class="table-of-contents__link">2: Cake Buffet</a></li><li><a href="#3-a-few-minutes-of-vacation" class="table-of-contents__link">3: A Few Minutes of Vacation</a></li><li><a href="#4-vision-of-the-future" class="table-of-contents__link">4: Vision of the Future</a></li><li><a href="#5-the-fighting-toji-san" class="table-of-contents__link">5: The Fighting Toji-san</a></li><li><a href="#new-years-ellen-start-hanetsuki-competition" class="table-of-contents__link">New Year's Ellen: Start: Hanetsuki Competition!</a></li><li><a href="#new-years-ellen-end-fun-together" class="table-of-contents__link">New Year's Ellen: End: Fun Together!</a></li><li><a href="#summer-uniform---ellen-start-meeting-up-with-kaoru-and-nene" class="table-of-contents__link">Summer Uniform - Ellen: Start: Meeting Up With Kaoru and Nene~</a></li><li><a href="#summer-uniform---ellen-end-after-a-mission-you-take-a-break" class="table-of-contents__link">Summer Uniform - Ellen: End: After a Mission, You Take a Break!</a></li><li><a href="#casual-20---ellen-start-the-pairs-new-years-eve" class="table-of-contents__link">Casual '20 - Ellen: Start: The Pair&#39;s New Year&#39;s Eve</a></li><li><a href="#casual-20---ellen-end-the-happy-new-year-plan" class="table-of-contents__link">Casual '20 - Ellen: End: The Happy New Year Plan</a></li><li><a href="#ceremonial-dress-misogi---ellen-start-lets-go-on-a-trip-to-change-the-world" class="table-of-contents__link">Ceremonial Dress Misogi - Ellen: Start: Let&#39;s Go On a Trip to Change the World!</a></li><li><a href="#ceremonial-dress-misogi---ellen-end-ive-done-it" class="table-of-contents__link">Ceremonial Dress Misogi - Ellen: End: I&#39;ve Done It!</a></li><li><a href="#police-officer---ellen-start-you-wont-get-away-with-any-parking-violations" class="table-of-contents__link">Police Officer - Ellen: Start: You Won&#39;t Get Away With Any Parking Violations!</a></li><li><a href="#police-officer---ellen-end-the-source-of-the-suspicious-gaze" class="table-of-contents__link">Police Officer - Ellen: End: The Source of the Suspicious Gaze...</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Links</div><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://pastebin.com/LdyviZ8Z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Translator anon&#x27;s pastebin<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Site source code<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Built with Docusaurus.</div></div></div></footer></div>
