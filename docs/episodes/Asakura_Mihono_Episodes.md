## 1: Asakura Mihono's Easygoing Day
**Mihono:** Yawwwn... Eh!? Crap! I'm gonna be late!  
**Subara Rika:** Morning, Mihono-chan~. You overslept again, didn't you? Your hair's a mess. You're usually so early on days with sparring practice though.  
**Rika:** Even if regular classes are boring, this is why you keep getting scolded, you know? But personally, I think learning the history of toji and tamahagane, and the relationship between noro and aradama, is pretty interesting.  
**Mihono:** Yeah, buttt...  
**Mihono:** Ah! More importantly! How're things going with that Fujiwara Shinjo-kun? If you don't hurry up, some other girl might make a move!  
**Rika:** H-Hey, keep it quiet, Mihono-chan! ...Umm, y-yesterday, I... Sent him a message.  
**Rika:** And, so, we're going to start studying together in the library soon.  
**Mihono:** Good for you! ...Wait, you two are childhood friends, aren't you? How are you only just now studying together?  
**Rika:** Look, Mihono-chan. As the heir to a shrine, Fujiwara-kun is working extremely hard!  
**Mihono:** I get that, but... Mmm, it feels like you two should have sealed the deal by now...  
**Mihono:** Hm?  
**???:** A-! SA-! KU-! RA-! MI-! HO-! NOOOO--! LET'S DUEL--!  
**Mihono:** Whoa! (Dodge!)  
**???:** UWAAAHH!  
*thud*  
**Nagae Futaba:** Don't dodge! Fight me fair and square!  
**Rika:** Fudaba-chan... There's nothing fair and square about sneak attacks...  
**Mihono:** Geez, you're always all worked up. You'd be so much cuter if you'd just calm down... You're not getting any more popular like that, you know?  
**Futaba:** Huh...!?  
**Rika:** Ufufu. You really like Mihono-chan, don't you, Futaba-chan?  
**Futaba:** I do not!  
**Hattori Tetsuo:** Ah! I figured you were the ones making all that noise! If you aren't busy, they need you to help out!  
**Mihono:** Ah, Hattori-senpai? Good morning-!  
**Futaba:** ...Gu-Goodmor... Ning...  
**Hattori:** What, you two were fighting again? Try to take it easy. Wouldn't want to see either of you get hurt.  
**Hattori:** Anyway, Asakura! You're getting called to action. Sounds like aradama showed up.  
**Mihono:** Huh? Uh, you're right! Sorry, Rika! I gotta go!  
**Futaba:** Ah! I'll go too!  
**Hattori:** You're staying put. For starters, they didn't call on you, and besides, you haven't been cleared for real combat yet.  
**Rika:** How'd it go, Mihono-chan?  
**Mihono:** Somehow I made it through without a scratch.  
**Hattori:** Good work. Give your Kiyomitsu to me; I'll do some maintenance on it.  
**Futaba:** Ah, Senpai! Um, ah... Err, m-my...  
**Mihono:** Don't worry about it, Senpai. I didn't wear Kiyomitsu out too bad this time. And besides, its scheduled maintenance is pretty soon.  
**Mihono:** But you should check out Futaba's Magoroku. She's been saying it's falling apart lately.  
**Futaba:** Ehh!?  
**Hattori:** Really? Then come on, Nagae. I'll give it a look.  
**Futaba:** A-Ah... Thank you so much, Hattori... Senpai...  
**Mihono:** ...... .........  
**Rika:** What are you smiling about, Mihono-chan?  
**Mihono:** Nah, it's just... Kids these days, huh~?  
**Rika:** ?  

## 2: Her Mother's Okatana
**Mirja:** I'm sorry to take up your time like this. There's something I wanted to ask you today... About Asakura Mihono's okatana, Kashuu Kiyomitsu.  
**Asakura Yoshizumi:** I don't mind one bit, Kitora... Mirja-san, was it? Time's about all I've got left to give anymore. So, what's got you so curious?  
**Mirja:** I have an ability... "Kantougan". When my okatana comes in contact with another, it lets me understand to a degree all there is to know about its background.  
**Mirja:** Of course, it's not uncommon for two blades to come into contact with each other in a match, so...  
**Mirja:** Anyway... In training the other day I was able to confirm it. Asakura Mihono's okatana is the very same Kashuu Kiyomitsu that was wielded by Okita Souji.  
**Mirja:** Of course, there's the well known legend of that okatana... Of how, during the Ikedaya incident, the tip of it was broken off.  
**Mirja:** However...  
**Yoshizumi:** You don't think quite that much had been broken, is that it? After all, in that raid by the Shinsengumi, it was only the very tip that broke.  Hmm... You sure do know the history of that okatana well.  
**Mirja:** As a general rule, okatana do not break. However, this would mark the second time Kiyomitsu has broken... What is the meaning of this?  
**Yoshizumi:** To give you an idea, I'll have to tell you a story of that girl's mother.  
**Mirja:** ......  
**Yoshizumi:** Don't worry, it's not such a sad story. Her mother was a toji as well. That okatana, Kashuu Kiyomitsu, belonged to her.  
**Yoshizumi:** It happened... About 20 years ago, on the day of the disaster. The unit her mother was in was cut off and surrounded by countless aradama.  
**Yoshizumi:** I'm told it was a very fierce battle. At some point, the end of that unbreakable okatana, much like back in the days of the Tokugawa shogunate, came flying off.  
**Yoshizumi:** The fragment that broke this time buried itself deep in Mihono's mother's chest, and could not be removed again.  
**Yoshizumi:** She returned safely from the battle, but... No more than ten years after, she passed on from this world.  
**Mirja:** I'm sorry to hear that...  
**Yoshizumi:** Actually, the story doesn't end there. During that time, she had become pregnant with Mihono...  
**Yoshizumi:** And it was no longer there. Under medical treatment, they searched again and again to try removing the fragment. But they couldn't find it anywhere in her body.  
**Mirja:** What does that mean...?  
**Yoshizumi:** You might have guessed... Mihono being chosen by Kashuu Kiyomitsu seems like no coincidence, after all.  
**Yoshizumi:** Even now, that fragment may be resting inside of her... At least, I can't help but believe as much.  

## 3: About the Childhood Friends (1)
**Mihono:** You wanted to hear about what we were like as childhood friends?  
**Kiyoka:** Yes. I was wondering about you and Setouchi-san. Ah, and here's your "Izu's 100 Famous Views Assorted Lunch" and green tea, Asakura-san.  
**Mihono:** Thanks. But, there's not much to say about me and Chii-nee.  
**Kiyoka:** Really? But among the five of us assigned here, you two just happened to be childhood friends. It feels almost like fate, doesn't it? Ah, here's your sandwich and warm tea, Setouchi-san.  
**Chie:** Thank you. But to call it fate... It's more like, maybe... A punishment game? Isn't it, Mihono-chan?  
**Mihono:** You heard, right Kiyoka? How I chased after Kanami and Chii-nee followed me. Well, President Ema got really mad and told us to work here.  
**Kiyoka:** Oh yeah, that's right... But, but, I'm still curious to hear what you were like as kids together.  
**Mihono:** Hmm~...  
**Mihono:** Well, it was about five years ago that Chii-nee moved away from Okayama... I was just a third year in elementary school back then, and Chii-nee had just started middle school.  
**Chie:** So you remember. Mihono-chan still acts mostly the same, but I used to be much more of a crybaby.  
**Chie:** My house wasn't too far from the Asakura Shrine, and so we'd always play around at the shrine until it got dark. It was a lot of fun; we'd all go catching bugs and playing other games.  
**Chie:** In the fall we'd eat baked sweet potatoes, and in the summer, the priest... Yoshizumi-san, would make us shaved ice. It was so good that I can still remember the taste.  
**Mihono:** It's actually gotten a power up since! Grandpa makes his own jam and syrup for it now. He gets the fruit and ice locally too.  
**Kiyoka:** Ah, I'd like to try that sometime.  
**Chie:** Me too; it's been so long.  
**Mihono:** Come on by, I'll set up reservations for two!  
**Chie:** Ufufu~  
**Mihono:** Ahaha!  
**Mihono:** But Chii-nee, you haven't changed a bit! You've still got that onee-san feeling... Your boobs got bigger though.  
**Chie:** Really? Well you've changed and you haven't, Mihono-chan. You still have that strong sense of justice, and you charge right into danger the same way. But you're taller now, and so much stronger, and you became so pretty.  
**Mihono:** Ahh! Geez! What's the big idea, complimenting me like that!? ...I'll be right back!  
**Kiyoka:** Um, where are you going?  
**Mihono:** T-The bathroom...!  
*Mihono runs away blushing*  
**Chie:** She didn't have to get so embarrassed about it.  
**Kofuki:** ......  
**Chie:** Welcome back, Shichinosato-san. How was the dining car?  
**Kofuki:** Nothing special. Anyway, Mihono just ran by making a crazy face... What's up with that?  

## 4: About the Childhood Friends (2)
**Chie:** Well, since Mihono-chan went to the bathroom, I'll say this... Actually, that sense of justice of hers has always made her a little reckless.  
**Chie:** Like when Etou Kanami-san and Juujou Hiyori-san attacked the head of the family... She ran after them shouting "I know there's a good reason for this!" Honestly, as her onee-san, I wish she wouldn't act like that...  
**Kofuki:** ...Like a moron?  
**Kiyoka:** Well, I think it's nice how much she trusts her friend.  
**Kofuki:** Huh? It's still dumb. There's no way she was getting through the elite guard and the rest of them.  
**Chie:** Mihono-chan's actually pretty capable, you know? In the qualifiers for the tournament, she came in third.  
**Kofuki:** Huh? Wait, she was Minoseki's substitute?  
**Kiyoka:** Asakura-san is strong, isn't she?  
**Chie:** That's right. But, ever since we were young, she's always had problems with... Concentrating, I guess? Her bursts of strength always wore out quick.  
**Kiyoka:** What do you mean?  
**Chie:** Our master used to say... Ah, when Mihono-chan was in elementary school, we went to the same fencing dojo together. Well, all the kids in the area went to some dojo.  
**Chie:** Anyway, when Mihono-chan was young... She used to shock even our master with her skill.  
**Chie:** Especially when she'd use techniques she shouldn't have learned yet, and she'd show a surprising level of judgment in what to use... But...  
**Kiyoka:** But?  
**Chie:** Strangely, it never lasted very long. Before you knew it she'd be back to her usual self.  
**Kiyoka:** Isn't that sort of like a toji's abilities?  
**Chie:** It was the same even when she didn't have an okatana, so I don't think so. As a swordfighter, when she didn't have that power, she was... Intense, yet average, I guess?  
**Kiyoka:** So that's why she didn't qualify as Minoseki's representative.  
**Chie:** But still, her sense of justice has always been strong... When she was little, she beat up some boys who were neighborhood bullies. And she sort of became their boss? Like joining Mihono's party?  
**Chie:** And one time we ran into an aradama in the woods. Mihono-chan held it off while we ran to call the adults.  
**Chie:** (Now that I think about it... Mihono-chan was always running into aradama, wasn't she? Almost like they'd gather around where she went...)  
**Kiyoka:** It's weird to think of Asakura-san leading a group of boys around. I can't even imagine her doing that now.  
**Chie:** I know, she must have changed after entering middle school.  
**Kofuki:** Hey.  
**Kiyoka:** ?  
**Kofuki:** Didn't she just enter her second year? So I'm supposed to believe... Just over a year ago, she was some kind of brat gang leader?  
**Kiyoka/Chie:** Now that you mention it!?  

## 5: Who Do They Like?
**Nagae Futaba:** U-Um, Hattori-senpai! W-Would you take...! A-A-Another look at my okatana sometime!?  
**Futaba:** T-Thank you so much...! It's a promise!  
**Hattori Tetsuo:** O-Okay, sure... W-Wait! Uh, Futaba-chan, wasn't it?  
**Hattori:** She's gone already though... Oww! Watch it, Asakura!?  
**Mihono:** Uwah! It's him!  
**Hattori:** Come on, don't treat me like that. I'm not an aradama.  
**Mihono:** ...Well, I'm going then.  
**Hattori:** Hang on. There's something I seriously want your advice on. You seem like the real gossipy type.  
**Mihono:** ...What's that? You wanna inspect my okatana up close and personal?  
**Hattori:** I'm just kidding!  
**Mihono:** Buy me sweets in the cafeteria for a week. Enough for me, Kiyoka, and Fukki. Then I'll help you out.  
**Hattori:** ...Fine, if that's what it takes.  
**Hattori:** Anyway, lately I've been seeing this gentle, and beautiful, and nice smelling, and accepting, and big chested... Goddess around...  
**Mihono:** ...You're already creeping me out. And why'd you stop and sigh while looking at my chest? You want to see my okatana that badly?  
**Hattori:** Sorry, I didn't mean to! But anyway, I need your help picking out a present for her. Something that might make her want to go out with me.  
**Mihono:** When you spring this on me all of a sudden, it's a little... Anyway, who's this "goddess"?  
**Hattori:** She comes here from Osafune every now and then.  
**Hattori:** Whenever I'm working support on the computers, she always smiles and tells me I'm doing such a good job. I'm surprised such an angel would be hanging out with you! No, she's a goddess!  
**Mihono:** (From Osafune...? Someone I know?)  
**Mihono:** (Wait, that's gotta be Chii-nee!)  
**Hattori:** What's wrong? Should I keep going? I just need to know, you know... What kind of guy she likes.  
**Mihono:** You mean Chii-nee, right? Just so you know, Chii-nee...  
**Mihono:** Who'd have guessed! She's into younger girls!  
**Hattori:** Wh... What...? So I never had a chance then...? Ahhhhh! Chie-saaaaan!  
**Mihono:** Oh, he ran off... It was just meant to be a joke... But if he was going to get shut down that easy, he didn't stand a chance anyway.  
**Mihono:** Still, to think Hattori-senpai would be into Chii-nee... That's too weird...  
**Futaba:** Hey, Mihono! You were talking to my Hattori-senpai, weren't you! Are you friends? Or... Don't tell me, you're going out!?  
**Mihono:** Huh? Going out with who?  
**Futaba:** Don't! Play! Dumb! With! Me!  
**Mihono:** Oh, you mean Hattori-senpai? Seems like he's into gentle, nice smelling, accepting, and big chested girls?  
**Mihono:** Good luck, Futaba!  
**Futaba:** Huh!? What do you mean, good luck!? T-Though I'm still growing... Mm, I'm still growing... I'll... I'll figure something out...  
**Mihono:** You'll be fine! Hattori-senpai likes girls that praise him too, so just keep it up and he'll be all over you... Probably.  
**Futaba:** Really...? You sure know a lot, Mihono... Wait, how do you know so much about Hattori-senpai... Wait...!?  
**Futaba:** Tell me! Is he your ex!?  
**Mihono:** Why'd you think that!?

## [Ceremonial Dress - Misogi: Start]: First Mission as a Toji
--This was at the time of Asakura Mihono's first assignment to suppress aradama.

  
**Aradama:** GGYAAAAAAAA-!  
**Fukuda Sawano:** Ahem. Everyone, please follow my instructions.  
**Sawano:** The aradama suppression will be carried out by the four high schoolers, including myself. If we work closely together, this will go smoothly.  
**Sawano:** Etou-san and Asakura-san, you'll be making sure there are no people still in the area. If anything comes up, please tell me right away.  
**Mihono/Kanami:** Understood!  
**Mihono:** Kanami! Let's make our first mission a good one!  
**Kanami:** Yeah! Let's go, Mihono-chan!  
**Girl:** Waaahh, Mama-! Where did you gooo-!  
**Mihono:** There's a girl over here! Just hold on! I'll be right there!  
**Aradama:** GAAAAAAAAA-!  
**Kanami:** Eh? There's an aradama out here too? Oh no! It's going after that girl!  
**Mihono:** I won't let it hurt her! Come on, Kashuu Kiyomitsu! DYAAAA-!  
**Mihono:** No way!? It dodged!?  
**Aradama:** GUGAA!  
**Mihono:** Kyaa-!  
**Mihono:** Ugh... I-I can't...  
**Mihono:** (Th-This is bad...! That girl's going to...!)  
**Aradama:** GAAAAAA!  
**Kanami:** That's far enough! HAAAAH-!  
**Aradama:** GUAAa aaa...  
**Mihono:** Kanami's amazing...! In just one swing, that aradama...  
**Sawano:** Etou-san, Asakura-san, you two did a nice job. It's thanks to your efforts that we were able to get that girl to safety.  
**Kanami:** Ehehe, we got complimented, Mihono-chan.  
**Mihono:** Y-Yeah...  
**Kanami:** Huh? Is something bothering you, Mihono-chan?  
**Mihono:** Nah, it's nothing... Sorry, Kanami, I'll catch up with you later...  
**Mihono:** (It wasn't supposed to be like that...)  
**Mihono:** (I wanted to fight to keep everybody safe and smiling... That's what I became a toji for...)  
**Mihono:** (But, I'm just...)  

## [Ceremonial Dress - Misogi: End]: Where There's a Will, There's a Way
**Mihono:** (A few months passed since my first mission as a toji. Ever since then, I helped suppress a lot of aradama.)  
**Mihono:** (But, while I watched Kanami start to contribute even more than all our senpai, like always, I was still useless...)  
**Mihono:** Ah, Grandpa? It's me, Mihono.  
**Asakura Yoshizumi:** Ohh, Mihono? What is it? It's rare of you to call me like this.  
**Mihono:** Yeah, well...  
**Mihono:** They're giving me a three day break, so I was thinking about coming back to visit, since it's been a while...  
**Yoshizumi:** Hm? Well, that would be fine...  
**Yoshizumi:** But, did something happen? You're always saying you need to practice your swordfighting, so you're too busy to come home.  
**Mihono:** Ahaha... I should've figured, Grandpa. I can't hide anything from you.  
**Yoshizumi:** What is it? I'll hear you out.  
**Yoshizumi:** The difference between reality and your expectations... That reminds me, you mentioned something like this before. With that girl, Kanami, was her name?  
**Mihono:** Yeah... Kanami is just amazing. Whatever mission she's on, she always makes such a big difference.  
**Mihono:** I thought I'd be like her too someday, but no matter how hard I try, it feels like I'm not getting anywhere...  
**Yoshizumi:** I see... You're the spitting image of her, you know. Your mother.  
**Mihono:** Eh? Mom?  
**Yoshizumi:** Yes, your mother used to talk like that. That nothing was going like the way she imagined it. But whatever happened, "where there's a will, there's a way."  
**Mihono:** Where there's a will, there's a way...?  
**Yoshizumi:** Your mother loved to say that phrase.  
**Mihono:** She did!? Where there's a will, there's a way, huh... I like the sound of that, Grandpa.  
**Mihono:** No matter what happens... You can do it! Don't give up! That's how it feels!  
**Yoshizumi:** Then, you should try using it from now on.  
**Mihono:** ...I will!  
**Yoshizumi:** So, are you coming back home then? Do you already know the date?  
**Mihono:** ...No, I changed my mind.  
**Mihono:** I think I'll stay here and keep on trying harder! Where there's a will, there's a way, right!  
**Mihono:** I have to become as strong as Kanami someday, so I can be a great toji who protects everyone's smiles!  
**Yoshizumi:** ...Good, if that's how you feel.  
**Mihono:** Yeah! Thanks, Grandpa! I'm going to go now, but I'll call you again next time, okay!  
**Yoshizumi:** Right, you can talk to me anytime.  
**Mihono:** Alright! I'll go right to the dojo and keep training! Starting with 100 practice swings! No wait, it should be 200!  
**Mihono:** Cause where there's a will, there's a way! Isn't that right, Mom!

## [Fairytale Mihono: Start]: Off to Wonderland
**Mihono:** ......I don't get it at allll. Help me, Chii-nee...  
**Chie:** Okay, okay, which problem don't you understand?  
**Mihono:** ...From here, to here.  
**Chie:** Here to here... That's almost all of it.  
**Chie:** Mihono-chan...  
**Mihono:** Don't look at me like that, Chii-nee! I can't help it!  
**Mihono:** Lately I've been doing aradama suppression missions, and expedition assignments, and I had to help with the escape room game too, remember? So I haven't had any time to study!  
**Chie:** Even if you're sure that's all there is to it, you still make me worried...  
**Mihono:** The one who's worried is me, cause I don't get any of this! At this rate, my summer vacation is in danger of makeup classes!  
**Chie:** Okay, okay. That's why I'm here watching you study, isn't it?  
**Chie:** Now then, first is this Japanese question. For this one...  
**Mihono:** .........guh.  
**Chie:** She fell asleep in the middle of the explanation!?  
**Chie:** Wake up, Mihono-chan! We have to hurry to Wonderland!  
**Mihono:** ...Chii-nee? Wonderland? We're done with the escape room game already...  
**Mihono:** Eh, where is this?  
**Chie:** Just how long do you plan on sleeping for, Mihono-chan?  
**Chie:** We're going on a mission to suppress aradama in Wonderland, aren't we?  
**Mihono:** An aradama suppression mission in Wonderland!?  
**Mihono:** ...Are you tired, Chii-nee?  
**Chie:** Okay, okay, whether you're feeling tired or anything else, just climb in that hole.  
**Mihono:** That hole...?  
**Mihono:** I have to go in here!? I can't even see the bottom!?  
**Chie:** ...What's gotten into you today? If you don't go in that hole, you can't make it to Wonderland, can you?  
**Mihono:** You're the one who's gotten into something, Chii-nee!  
**Mihono:** If I fell down that hole, I'd die for sure!  
**Chie:** Nobody's died going down there. You'll be fine.  
**Mihono:** And who proved that!?  
**Chie:** Honestly now, you can't go fussing over every little thing, you know? Now then... Have a nice trip.  
**Mihono:** ...Huh?  
**Mihono:** GYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!  

## [Fairytale Mihono: End]: Which Me is the Real Me?
**Mihono:** I'M-FALL-ING-DO-WWWN--!!  
**Chie:** Good morning, Mihono-chan.  
**Mihono:** EEEEEEE!?  
**Chie:** ...Screaming like that just from seeing my face; are you trying to give me a shock...?  
**Mihono:** That's cause! You pushed me into that hole... and I fell... Wait? Was I dreaming?  
**Chie:** Honestly now, not being able to tell a dream from reality, it's like you're having the butterfly's dream.  
**Mihono:** The butterfly's dream?  
**Chie:** It's a story about someone who dreamed that they became a butterfly, then couldn't tell if they were themselves now, or the butterfly dreaming they were themselves.  
**Mihono:** ......It sounds like a confusing story.  
**Chie:** What it means is, the Mihono-chan who's here studying now could just be a dream of the Mihono-chan who's falling forever into that hole.  
**Mihono:** Huh, that's weird......  
**Mihono:** Why'd you know I was falling forever into that hole, Chii-nee?  
**Chie:** You're so funny, Mihono-chan. Of course I'd know about that. After all--  
**Chie:** We're on our way to Wonderland to suppress the aradama, aren't we?  
**Mihono:** ...Huh?  
**Mihono:** BGYAAAAAAAAAAAA!!  
**Chie:** Fufu, isn't this wonderful, Mihono-chan?  
**Chie:** If you don't want to study for your exams, you won't have to anymore. You can suppress aradama forever in Wonderland.  
**Mihono:** I don't want to do that either!  
**Mihono:** Anyway, how far down does this hole go!?  
**Chie:** Until you think about what you've done wrong Mihono-chan.  
**Mihono:** Then, I did! I did just now!  
**Chie:** Did you really?  
**Mihono:** I really thought hard about what I did wrong!  
**Mihono:** I don't want to be in the butterfly's dream anymore, Chii-nee!  
**Chie:** KYAAA!?  
**Mihono:** Chii-nee!? You're the real Chii-nee, aren't you!?  
**Mihono:** Owwch! Ith not a dweam!! I did it, Chii-nee...!  
**Chie:** Are you still half asleep?  
**Chie:** Anyway, the butterfly's dream was the correct answer to the first problem. You said you didn't know, but you really did, didn't you?  
**Mihono:** Th-That's not it! The Chii-nee inside my dream told me about the butterfly's dream...  
**Chie:** Is that so, the me in your dreams taught you about it. Then, let's do the next problem.  
**Mihono:** The me inside my dreams... Was that all it was? ......That really was just a dream, wasn't it?  
**Chie:** What are you saying? Fufufu, you're so funny, Mihono-chan.

## [Casual 20 - Mihono: Start]: Planning a New Year's Trip
Several days before New Year's Eve.

  
**Mihono:** I can't take the local gourmet off the list after all, can I. But, I wanted to put the petting zoo in too...  
**Yui:** Huh, what are you doing all by yourself there, Mihono-chan?  
**Mihono:** Yui, and Mirja-san too!  
**Mirja:** That's quite a lot of guidebooks you have open. Are you going on a trip somewhere?  
**Mihono:** I'm planning on doing an overnight trip on New Year's Eve with Chii-nee... And, I was checking what sights we should go see!  
**Yui:** Two girls, taking a trip into the new year together... Just those words alone are enough to make your heart throb. Maybe I'll tag along too...  
**Mirja:** Yamashiro Yui, that would be inconsiderate of you. And, if I recall, you have missions scheduled as far as New Year's Eve, don't you?  
**Yui:** Ugh, you're right... I'm so jealous Mihono-chan and them get to take their New Year's break early-.  
**Mihono:** Hang in there, Yui. I'll be sure to get souvenirs to bring back for everyone.   
**Yui:** Souvenirs are nice and all, but more than that, I want to see lovey dovey photos of you two on your trip!  
**Yui:** Please, help me get through my missions on New Year's Eve! Send them to me as you go! I'll be waiting for them!  
**Mihono:** O-Okay, sure. I'll send them when I remember to.  
**Yui:** If I can get some shots of two dreamy girls spending a heart-pounding New Year's tour together, I feel like I'll be able to pull through! You have to send them to me no matter what! It's a promise!  
**Mihono:** Okay, I'll do what I can, but, what kind of photos do you want anyway?  
**Yui:** Let's see... How about, photos of the two of you feeding each other food you bought on the train, like, "Ahhn"!  
**Yui:** And then, photos of you staring deep into each others' eyes on the beach while you share your love, and photos of the two of you proposing in a romantic church deep in the mountains!  
**Mirja:** I can't help but feel your suggestions are leading towards something other than a normal tour for two girls...  
**Mihono:** Well, I was hoping to have something a little more exciting for us to do together, but do you have any ideas, Mirja-san?  
**Mirja:** If you are planning a New Year's trip, a shrine visit and viewing the first sunrise would be standard suggestions.  
**Mirja:** And, if time permits, it might be good to work in something slightly more original.  
**Mihono:** Something more original? Like what?  
**Mirja:** For example, rather than simply viewing the first sunrise on New Year's day, why not admire the setting sun on New Year's Eve?  
**Mirja:** It's something I've considered for some time now. Everyone glorifies the year's first sunrise, but why do they pay no attention to the year's last sunset?  
**Mihono:** You're right, every year things are so busy on the evening of New Year's Eve that I don't think I've ever sat back and watched the sun go down.  
**Yui:** Yeah yeah, me too-.  
**Yui:** But you know, if I were the sun, I'd be happy having everyone admire me on New Year's morning, but I think I'd want people admiring me on the last sunset after I worked so hard all year too!  
**Mirja:** I've never exactly thought about how it would make the sun feel...  
**Mirja:** I've always thought that those who can appreciate the sunset, the same as they would the sunrise, will get the most benefit from the year's first sunrise the next morning.  
**Mihono:** I get it! I think that's a great way of looking at it. It might give us better fortune from watching the sunrise, so I I'll try putting watching the sunset into our plan too!  
**Mihono:** Okaaay, now just to find the perfect place to watch the sunset with Chii-nee!  

## [Casual 20 - Mihono: End]: At the Year's Final Sunset...
On New Year's Eve. Partway through Mihono and Chie's trip together, they happened to meet Kiyoka, Sanae, and Yume, and all went to watch the sunset from an observation tower together.

  
**Mihono:** Chii-nee, look, look! The setting sun looks so pretty!  
**Chie:** It sure is pretty, isn't it. Ah, Mihono-chan, it looks like we can go out onto the deck from there.  
**Mihono:** Whoa, the wind's strong out here. Chii-nee, be careful so your scarf doesn't get blown away, okay!  
**Chie:** Right. You too, Mihono-chan; be sure your hat doesn't get swept off. Though, the air is nice and clear up here too.  
**Mihono:** Yeah, it might be cold, but getting to see the sunset so clearly is the best! Oh yeah! Chii-nee, let's take a picture!  
**Chie:** Another picture? You've been taking them nonstop ever since this morning.  
**Mihono:** We're on a big trip together, so don't you want to have a bunch of things to remember it by? Kiyoka, could you take our picture with my phone?  
**Kiyoka:** I don't mind, but, Hono-chan, with all the pictures you're taking, your phone must be running out of space, right? I'll take it on my phone and send it to you later.  
**Mihono:** You will? Thanks. That's a big help-.  
**Kiyoka:** Okay, Hono-chan, Setouchi-san, please come up with a pose!  
**Chie:** Umm, a pose... What should we...  
**Kiyoka:** If you want to give off a fun mood, how about if you do something like throwing both hands up in the air?  
**Mihono:** Like this? Banzai-!  
**Kiyoka:** Yeah, that's great, Hono-chan! Though, you still had your phone in your hand... Next, how about you stay just like that, but hold each other's hands?  
**Mihono:** That might look good! Come on, hold my hand, Chii-nee! Yayyy!  
**Mihono:** WAH---- What do I do!? I dropped my phone!  
**Chie:** Eh-!? You mean right now, when we held hands?  
**Mihono:** I think so. It's not on the floor here, so don't tell me...  
**Yume:** You were swinging your hands all around, Onee-san, so I think it might've fallen all the way off the deck.  
**Mihono:** No way...  
**Sanae:** This observation tower is a hundred meters up off the ground too. There's a cliff below us, so I don't think it could have hit anybody, but if it hit the rocks down there, it would have broken for sure...  
**Mihono:** I don't believe it... And I took so many pictures all day too-. Uuu... How could something like this happen...  
**Kiyoka:** Hono-chan, sorry. This all happened because I got carried away and asked you to do poses.  
**Mihono:** It's not your fault, Kiyoka. I was the one who let go because I wasn't careful.  
**Mihono:** Sigh... For me to mess up this bad at the very very end of the year; my luck is the worst.  
**Chie:** Don't look so sad, Mihono-chan. We might not be able to get the pictures back, but because of you, I've been having lots of fun all day.  
**Chie:** All the memories are right here in my heart, so it's fine. Here, raise up your head. We can still make plenty more memories together from now on.  
**Mihono:** Chii-nee...  
**Kiyoka:** Ahh, the closeness between those two. It kind of makes you feel like tearing up, doesn't it?  
**Sanae:** I know. That closeness itself might be the best takeaway from this trip...  
**Yume:** Hey, hey, somebody's phone's been ringing. It's ruining the mood. Whose is it?  
**Chie:** It isn't mine. ...Hm? Mihono-chan, isn't the ringing coming from behind you?  
**Mihono:** Huh? Now that you say it, I think so. But, my phone fell down the cliff...  
**Kiyoka:** Wait! Hono-chan, isn't there something in the hood of your parka?  
**Mihono:** Whoa-! It's my phone! It didn't fall down the cliff; it fell into my hood.  
**Sanae:** I can hardly believe it. But, isn't that great for you, Asakura-san.  
**Mihono:** Yeah, and it seems like all my photos are safe too. Sorry for making all of you worry, guys!  
**Yume:** Good for you. But, wouldn't you normally notice if something fell into your hood, Onee-san?  
**Mihono:** I had no idea when it happened...  
**Chie:** You might not have been able to notice in the panic after you dropped it. But, I'm glad to see you're back to your happy self, Mihono-chan.  
**Sanae:** By the way, your phone has been ringing for a while, hasn't it? Who's trying to get a hold of you?  
**Mihono:** Ahhh! Yui sent me all these texts!  
**Kiyoka:** "Where's those lovey dovey shots of you two you promised?" "The sun is already setting" "Hurry up-!" it says. Do you have to text her back?  
**Mihono:** That reminds me, I did promise I'd send her pictures of Chii-nee and me together.  
**Mihono:** But, all I took were normal pictures of us having fun sightseeing, so it's probably not anything like what Yui's expecting.  
**Kiyoka:** Fufu, in that case, I'll take one for you now. Hono-chan, hug up nice and close against Setouchi-san. Press your cheeks together too, and it'll look extra lovey dovey!  
**Mihono:** I-I can't do that out of nowhere-! It'd be embarrassing, right, Chii-nee?  
**Chie:** Well, it is a little embarrassing, but since we are on a big trip, it might be nice to have photos like this too.  
**Mihono:** I guess so... Then, when in Rome! [hug-]!  
**Kiyoka:** Yeah, that pose looks perfect! I'm taking the picture now. Say cheese!

## [Dress 20 - Mihono: Start]: I Want to Throw a Thank You Party!
**Mihono:** Let's throw a thank you party for the Miss Five Traditions competition! Everybody tried really hard, so, no matter how it turns out, let's thank them!  
**Mihono:** Or something like that!  
**Kofuki:** Fine by me?  
**Chie:** Then, I'll make us some food.  
**Mihono:** Chii-nee's gonna cook!  
**Mihono:** ...But wait, why don't we just go do karaoke?  
**Mihono:** I do want to eat Chii-nee's cooking, but I want it to be something more casual and fun where we can let loose.  
**Chie:** Fufu, you're just being considerate. Karaoke, hm. I'll look forward to it.  
**Mirja:** That's right, I'll have to tune my throat beforehand.  
**Yui:** I can't wait to hear Mirja-san's singing! Let's sing a duet together!  
**Kiyoka:** Are you only going to be inviting the investigation team?  
**Mihono:** Since we're doing this, I want to reach out to Kanami and them too.  
**Kiyoka:** It would be more fun with everyone going, won't it? I'll talk to Juujou-san.  
**Chie:** Then, I'll ask Kaoru-san and Ellen-san. Tsugumi-san, can you speak to Itomi-san about it?  
**Tsugumi:** Understood. I'll ask Itomi-san.  
**Mihono:** Alright-, Kiyoka, Yui, Fukki-! Let's go do karaoke now! We've gotta build up our stock of songs!  
**Mihono:** Wait, that was what we talked about, so why'd it turn into a party at such a fancy place!?  
**Kanami:** I heard the elite guard and Yukari-sama found out about it, and it sounds like Yukari-sama decided to hold a great big party to thank everyone.  
**Mihono:** Our karaoke meetup turned into a real party!  
**Mihono:** Hey, Kanami! Since Yukari-sama did this, that means she had to have gotten some yummy food for us, right!  
**Mihono:** Mmmm, I can't wait!  
**Kanami:** I know what you mean, Mihono-chan.  
**Mai:** Kanami-chan, Mihono-chan, it seems like they have dresses ready for us over there.  
**Mihono:** She got us dresses too!? Let's go quick, Kanami!  
**Kanami:** Ah, wait up, Mihono-chan!?  
**Mai:** You don't have to be in such a rush you two; they have enough for everyone...  
**Mai:** They're already gone.  
**Sayaka:** Mai?  
**Mai:** Oh, Sayaka-chan.  
**Sayaka:** Kanami and Mihono were running. Did something happen?  
**Mai:** Nothing's happened, you don't have to worry. More importantly, what did you need?  
**Sayaka:** I came to get you.  
**Mai:** Thank you. I'm looking forward to seeing the dresses.  
**Sayaka:** Mm.  

## [Dress 20 - Mihono: End]: Earrings and a Necklace
**Kiyoka:** Hono-chan, I'm going on ahead.  
**Mihono:** Okay-, I'll be out in a minute.  
**Kiyoka:** Alright!  
**Mihono:** (It's just me and Itomi-san left, huh.)  
**Mihono:** (I just need to put this ear piercing in, and... There! It's all set!)  
**Mihono:** Okay, Itomi-san, I'm going to get going too now.  
**Sayaka:** ...  
**Mihono:** Itomi-san? What's wrong?  
**Sayaka:** I can't attach this necklace right.  
**Mihono:** Necklace?  
**Mihono:** ...Ah.  
**Sayaka:** I'll be okay, so you can go, Mihono.  
**Mihono:** Since I'm already here, let's go together. Could I see your necklace? I'll put it on for you.  
**Sayaka:** ...Okay.  
**Mihono:** Doing this much is no big deal. And besides, this necklace; it's cute, isn't it!  
**Sayaka:** Thank you, Mihono. Your earrings are cute too.  
**Mihono:** Ahaha, thanks! There, it's on!  
**Mihono:** Okay, let's go!  
**Sayaka:** Mm.  
**Mihono:** Huh, did somebody come back? I'm coming-.  
**Mihono:** Chii-nee and Mai?  
**Chie:** I thought, if you were still getting ready, I could give a hand, but... It looks like you're fine.  
**Mai:** You look like you're finished too, Sayaka-chan.  
**Mai:** ...Mmhm, you look very cute.  
**Sayaka:** Thank you, Mai.  
**Sayaka:** Mihono put this necklace on for me.  
**Mai:** I see; Wasn't that nice of her.  
**Sayaka:** Mm.  
**Chie:** So you were late because you were helping Itomi-san finish up.  
**Mihono:** There was that too, but it's mostly because I couldn't decide what earrings to go with. What do you think of these?  
**Chie:** I like them; they look great on you, Mihono-chan.  
**Mihono:** Ehehe, I'm glad to hear it then! Okay-, let's all go out to the party!  
<div class="videoWrapper"><iframe width="640" height="480" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/75s9LlmOAs4"></iframe></div>  

## [Summer Uniform - Mihono: Start]: Because of the Horizon Alliance?
**Mihono:** Tomorrow's barbecue is going to be great, huh, Kiyoka.  
**Kiyoka:** Yeah. Though, it's a little sad we couldn't have everyone from the investigation team come along to refresh themselves.  
**Mihono:** We can't always get everyone together at once. There's missions to take care of.  
**Mihono:** But Chii-nee and Mirja-san'll be coming, won't they?  
**Kiyoka:** Yeah. And it seems like Ellen-san and one of Mirja-san's friends from Ayanokouji will be joining us tomorrow.  
**Kiyoka:** It would be even better if Juujou-san, Kaoru-san, and Kofuki-san were coming too; then we could hold one of our meetings-.  
**Mihono:** You get pretty excited, huh Kiyoka... About doing stuff for the Alliance.  
**Kiyoka:** Mmhm! After all, it's a lot of fun, getting to talk about fashion and beauty topics with everyone.  
**Kiyoka:** I like being able to chat a little when we're all together after a mission too.  
**Mihono:** Ah, I sorta get what you mean!  
**Kiyoka:** And also, it gives me an chance to talk more with Juujou-san.  
**Mihono:** Do you and Juujou-san talk a lot? Ever since she joined the Alliance?  
**Kiyoka:** I'd already started talking with her a little because of a book. I lent it to her just a bit before the tournament.  
**Kiyoka:** Though, back then, Juujou-san sort of had this hard to approach feeling.  
**Kiyoka:** But she isn't like that at all anymore lately. She texts me casually too.  
**Mihono:** So that's how it is-.  
**Mihono:** Juujou-san's pretty interesting once you talk to her, isn't she.  
**Kiyoka:** Yeah. She has a kind of uniqueness to her. I think she's really nice.  
**Kiyoka:** That's why, I wanted us to get closer, so I was hoping Juujou-san might come along to the barbecue.  
**Mihono:** Since you go to school together, I'm sure you'll have a lot of other chances.  
**Kiyoka:** That's true.  
**Mihono:** Anyway, the meat that I'm bringing tomorrow is some really good stuff, so you should look forward to it-. I spent a lot of money on it-.  
**Kiyoka:** You went that far... You're serious about this, aren't you, Hono-chan.  
**Mihono:** I'm going all out to have a good time tomorrow!  
**Kiyoka:** That reminds me, they say chicken meat is good for breast enhancement, but, do you think it's actually true-?  
**Kiyoka:** There's rumors that it's all made up.  
**Mihono:** I'm not sure? Though, the meat for tomorrow is beef!  
**Mihono:** And I bet it's not going to lose to chicken!  
**Kiyoka:** Well, I'm looking forward to trying your meat, Hono-chan!  
**Mihono:** The weather forecast said it'd be sunny, so it'll be perfect for barbecuing!  
**Mihono:** Ahh, I wish it were tomorrow already-.  

## [Summer Uniform - Mihono: End]: Isn't Meat Best After All
The day of the barbecue--

  
**Mihono:** Okaaay, I think I'll grill up some meat! It's meat time~!  
**Uraga Nao:** Oh, Asakura-san. Need me to grill more~?  
**Mihono:** Ah, no, I'll be fine! I want to try grilling it myself!  
**Mihono:** The barbecue boss should enjoy her own food!  
**Nao:** Grilling it yourself is fun too, isn't it~.  
**Nao:** Wait... When did I start letting the barbecue boss title slide...?  
**Mirja:** It's the truth, so isn't it better this way?  
**Nao:** Mirja, if you're going to be like that, I'm not giving you a taste of this perfect combination of baguettes al ajillo~.  
**Nao:** Want some, Setouchi-san~?  
**Chie:** It looks delicious; I think I will.  
**Mirja:** Urgh... So your next strategy is to starve me out. I'll stop spreading the word of the barbecue boss...  
**Mihono:** What should I do now~. Ah, skewers might be good!  
**Kiyoka:** Hono-chan! Hold on a minute!  
**Mihono:** Wawah!? Kiyoka!? Wh-What's up?  
**Kiyoka:** Hono-chan, your meat was so tasty that we were forgetting something important!  
**Mihono:** ...?  
**Kiyoka:** Wasn't our plan to eat what Chie-san and the others were eating, to learn the trick to getting bigger?  
**Kiyoka:** If we eat any more meat, we won't have room for anything else.  
**Mihono:** Buttt... Everybody's eating meat, so maybe meat's the best thing to eat!  
**Kiyoka:** That's...  
**Mihono:** It's a good idea, right?  
**Kiyoka:** I can't disagree with that...  
**Kiyoka:** ...B-But, no. You almost got me, but, if meat is what we already have in common, then we have to try copying them with things besides meat!  
**Mihono:** Ehh~... Ah, wait, hang on. Just the stuff I'm grilling right now then~... It'd be a waste otherwise!  
**Kiyoka:** It's not good to waste food, is it.  
**Mihono:** So you get it! Meat's definitely good for growing! Boobs are meat too, right!  
**Kiyoka:** Then, let's quickly eat up the meat you're grilling now!  
**Mihono:** Eh?  
**Kiyoka:** Eat faster, Hono-chan... [chew chew].  
**Kiyoka:** Mirja-san and Uraga-san are putting something on their baguettes now.  
**Mihono:** Uh... Kiyoka? I think we should slow down and enjoy the taste a little more...  
**Kiyoka:** Okay... It sure is tasty, huh!  
**Mihono:** It's tasty, so let's eat it more slowly...  
**Kiyoka:** We can't do that; if we don't eat fast, we won't be able to eat all the same foods.  
**Mihono:** Kgh...  
**Mihono:** A-Alright, Kiyoka! [chew chew]...!  
**Mihono:** (Kiyoka... She's way too eager about Alliance stuff... I mean, sometimes she puts on too much pressure!)  
**Mihono:** (All I wanted was to really savor the meat~!)  
**Chie:** Fufu, look at Mihono-chan and Kiyoka-chan scarfing down the meat.  
**Chie:** They must have really been excited for the barbecue.  
  

## [Pirate - Mihono: Start]: Our Reward's A Treasure Hunt at the Amusement Park!
**Aradama:** GGGIII...!  
**Mihono:** Ehh... There's more aradama this way!? They're small, but, this many is...!  
**Yomi:** Asakura-san, please focus on the aradama to the front.  
**Mihono:** Satsuki-san! But, will Akira-san be fine on her own?  
**Yomi:** She should be fine. Using cover, she drew the aradama to where they were manageable.  
**Mihono:** Then, we have to beat the aradama here and get to where Akira-san is!  
**Yomi:** ......  
**Yomi:** You're right.  
**Mihono:** We've gotta give it our best!  
**Mihono:** --YAAAAAH!  
**Park Manager:** Thank you very much. Now we can re-open for business.  
**Park Manager:** As a way to give our thanks, once the others are finished clearing out the aradama, would you like to enjoy our newest attraction?  
**Park Manager:** It's based around a theme of pirates and treasure hunting; "Treasures of the Pirates".  
**Park Manager:** And there were nine toji who came here today. You can make three teams of three, so it works out perfectly.  
**Mihono:** ...!!  
**Akira:** Nah, we're good. That's a real nice offer, but we've got work to get back to.  
**Mihono:** Akira-san...  
**Akira:** ...Or I was thinking, but, if you're gonna extend the favor, we should have some fun after all!  
**Mihono:** If we're in teams of three, we can just stay in the teams we're in, so we can play as soon as the mission's over!  
**Park Manager:** Then, I'll arrange for that. We would appreciate it if you would give us your impressions once you're done as well.  
**Akira:** That's a small price to pay. Thanks for having us!  
**Mihono:** I'll go let everybody know! And help them out too!  
**Mihono:** Good thing everybody was happy with it!  
**Mihono:** Fukki and Inami-san got mad at me for picking the teams for them though.  
**Ellen:** But, I do think it's simplest doing the treasure hunt with the same teams we fought aradama with today.  
**Hiyori:** And it'd be annoying going out of our way to decide on new teams.  
**Ellen:** We might be on different teams, but I'm glad I get to play with you, Hiyoyon. It's been a while since we got to do something like this.  
**Hiyori:** Well... I am on the same team as Inami Suu and Kofuki. Can't say I'm not worried.  
**Ellen:** I predict Hiyoyon and her merry friends will be a tough team to beat!  
**Mihono:** Ellen-san's team with Yui and Kiyoka seems tough too, but we aren't gonna lose-!  
**Akira:** You tell 'em, Mihono. Let's go find that treasure for ourselves!  
**Mihono:** Hmmm. What do you think the treasure pendants'll be like?  
**Yui:** That's one thing to look forward to, but what I really want to see to is everybody dressed like pirates! I'll burn it deep into my eyes and plenty of photos on my phone~!  
**Mihono:** Yeah, yeah! Besides the treasure hunt, it's going to be so fun fighting in pirate cosplay for the flags-.  

## [Pirate - Mihono: End]: The Treasure Comes After we Take Down Their Pirate Flag!
**Mihono:** Wawah!?  
**Mihono:** It's great and all I made it over to this ship without Kiyoka and them noticing, but... Bringing down their pirate flag is actually tough...!  
**Yui:** Fu fu fu~. And what about you, Mihono-chan? You sure you didn't want to stop us from bringing down your pirate flag?  
**Mihono:** Eh... Our ship-- Are Kiyoka and Ellen-san there already!?  
**Mihono:** Wait... Nobody's there. Yuiii~.  
**Yui:** If you take down our flag, we have to give you the treasure map-. So I'll tell a lie if I have to.  
**Mihono:** But, that's not enough to make me give up!  
**Akira:** Me and Yomi'll take 'em head on, dealing with anybody coming off of Yui's ship.  
**Akira:** I want you protecting our flag, Mihono. If they take it down, they get to take our treasure map.  
**Mihono:** Then...  
**Akira:** That's what I wanna say, but we're pirates. It'd be lame to just stand guard.  
**Akira:** So, a little after we start up, you sneak on board their ship and take their flag down. Then it's all ours.  
**Mihono:** But, what happens if they get on board our ship?  
**Yomi:** We can worry about that when it happens, is that right?  
**Akira:** Well, that's how we're winging it. Sounds cooler for you too, right, Mihono?  
**Mihono:** Yeah! I'll sneak in and take down their flag! Leave it to me!  
**Mihono:** I thought I'd get in all sneaky and bring your flag down though...  
**Yui:** If that was... your sneaking, being a spy or a ninja really isn't for you, Mihono-chan.  
**Yui:** I kept hearing "Ahh!" and "Crap!"   
**Mihono:** No way~... I thought I was doing perfect though.  
**Mihono:** But still, so long as I keep pulling the rope hard--  
**Akira:** That's it! Keep it up just like that, Mihono!  
**Mihono:** EIIII---!!  
**Mihono:** Even though we got Yui's pirate flag, we didn't have any time to look for treasure...!  
**Akira:** Suu's team found the pirate pendants first anyway, so we lost either way.  
**Ellen:** With the number of people we had today, we couldn't keep up with two teams at once.  
**Ellen:** If we had more people, I bet it would be twice as much fun-!  
**Mihono:** Next time I want to invite Kanami and Chii-nee along.  
**Suu:** ......  
**Mihono:** Though, even though she found the treasure, Inami-san doesn't look happy about it at all.  
**Kiyoka:** From what I heard, it sounds like there was an aradama hiding by the treasure... Apparently it was a really small one though.  
**Kiyoka:** And then Kofuki-san chased after it, leaving Inami-san alone in a dark model cave for a while.  
**Mihono:** Ahh... Fukki... She would run off and leave her, wouldn't she. If she saw an aradama.  
**Mihono:** Maybe I'll ask her if she wants to get something tasty to eat after.  
**Kiyoka:** Mm, we should do that.

## [Xmas' 20 - Mihono: Start]: The Investigation Team's Christmas Party (Preparations)
**Mihono:** Jingle bells~, jingle bells~.  
**Mirja:** Stop singing and put your hands to work. We won't finish getting ready for the Christmas party at this rate.  
**Mihono:** Okaaay!  
**Chie:** Hey, Mirja. About the cooking for the party...  
**Mirja:** That's right... I'll leave everything to you, Setouchi Chie. You're our best when it comes to cooking.  
**Chie:** Alright then.  
**Chie:** Everyone, can I have a moment? For the cooking for the party, does anyone have any requests?  
**Tsugumi:** Cooking, hm. Should I help with that?  
**Kofuki:** Hell no! Are you trying to ruin everybody's Christmas!?  
**Tsugumi:** That's a shame.  
**Kofuki:** Anyway, what about that? That chicken! That tasted so good.  
**Kiyoka:** That chicken... I'm pretty sure Hono-chan bought it, right?  
**Mihono:** Yeah! It was from this meat shop I stumbled across.  
**Mihono:** It smelled so good walking past the store, so I tried some croquettes, and they were really yummy! So I decided to get chicken from there.  
**Mihono:** Their croquettes, meatcakes, ham cutlets... They all tasted good.  
**Mihono:** The meatcakes were so juicy, and the ham cutlets were really thick!  
**Kofuki:** [gulp] Just hearing you talk about them's making me hungry... Wait, hold up. I don't remember eating any croquettes?  
**Mihono:** Cause I didn't buy any.  
**Mihono:** I mean, wouldn't croquettes for Christmas be weird?  
**Kofuki:** If they're tasty, then buy 'em too!  
**Mihono:** Well I got us chicken, didn't I!  
**Chie:** Okay, that's enough, you two.  
**Chie:** Is everyone alright with having Mihono-chan get us chicken again this year?  
**Kofuki:** No complaints here! Anyway, Mihocchi, where's this place at? Let's go get some croquettes.  
**Mihono:** Let's go make the reservation together then, Fukki.  
**Kofuki:** That works.  
**Kofuki:** While we're at it, let's order a buncha stuff besides chicken. We gotta get croquettes and meatcakes and ham cutlets!  
**Chie:** Don't go deciding that on your own... That's nothing but fried food. I think I'd better prepare lots of vegetables for us.  

## [Xmas' 20 - Mihono: Start]: The Investigation Team's Christmas Party
On Christmas Day.

  
**Mihono:** HAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!  
**Aradama:** Oooo...  
**Mihono:** Even though it's Christmas, we still got a mission!  
**Kofuki:** What're you complaining about, Mihocchi! Doesn't this make the best Christmas present!  
**Kofuki:** I love you! Aradama-chan!  
**Aradama:** Aaaa...  
**Mihono:** You're the only one who'd think that, Fukki!  
**Mihono:** And they're spider types too... That's not the kind of aradama people wanna see on Christmas!  
**Kofuki:** What kinda aradama do they want to see on Christmas?  
**Mihono:** Like, Kaoru-san's Nene-chan! There's gotta be people out there who'd want a Christmas version Nenegurumi!  
**Mihono:** I mean, I'd want one!  
**Mihono:** But, if Nene-chan attacked me, I couldn't hurt him... What should I do, Fukki!?  
**Kofuki:** How am I supposed to know!  
**Kofuki:** Anyway, the next one's coming! Quit messing around!  
**Mihono:** Alright!  
**Mihono:** [snooze]...  
**Kofuki:** Orah, next one... [snooze]  
**Chie:** Just when we got things set up, they all fell asleep.  
**Mirja:** They had a tough mission. It's understandable.  
**Yui:** Uhehe, uhehe...  
**Kiyoka:** U-ughh...  
**Mirja:** ...Honestly, just what dreams are they having.  
**Chie:** Fufu.  
**Chie:** Since everything's ready, do you want to try a bit of the food?  
**Mirja:** Okay, I will. Though, we should limit it to the salad.  
**Chie:** That's true; they'd all be disappointed if the main dishes ran out.

## [Star Ocean - Mihono: Start]: Found a Ramen Stall!
**Mihono:** Hmm, there's nothing on the spectrum finder. We're not really finding anything, huh.  
**Miki:** That's for sure. We're over here looking around every corner for them, so the least they could do is show up a little.  
**Mihono:** I know!  
**Miki:** And now I'm feeling kind of hungry...  
**Mihono:** Ugh, me too...  
**Mihono:** Want to... go get some food?  
**Miki:** Sure! Let's do that!  
**Miki:** Tell me where you like to eat, Mihono!  
**Mihono:** Hmm, someplace I like to eat... It's a little far, but...  
**Miki:** Ugh... It's far away...  
**Miki:** I don't think my stomach is going to make it that far...  
**Mihono:** Actually, I think mine's the same...  
**Mihono:** What's something tasty nearby... Something tasty nearby...  
**Mihono:** Hear that... That's a ramen stall!  
**Mihono:** Let's go there, Miki-san!  
**Miki:** Phew, I'm so full... They had that "stall" taste to them; I really liked it.  
**Mihono:** ......  
**Miki:** What's up, Mihono?  
**Mihono:** Doesn't your... stomach hurt at all?  
**Miki:** Eh?  
**Mihono:** Eh?  
**Mihono:** I mean, you had stuff from the whole menu, right...?  
**Miki:** I ate them all, but I didn't drink all the soup, so it's all good!  
**Mihono:** (Is that really all good...?)  
**Miki:** I actually wanted to have some more of it, but, see, it's already nighttime? So I held off a little.  
**Mihono:** Y-Yeah, I guess...  
**Mihono:** (I feel like she already ate a whole bunch though...)  
**Mihono:** B-But, we did go looking around all day today, so it's fine to eat that much... right?  
**Miki:** Yeah, it's fine!  
**Miki:** So come on, let's work it off and go look around over that way, Mihono!  

## [Star Ocean - Mihono: End]: Found Some Cats!
**Mihono:** It sorta feels like we're just going on a walk together after we got that ramen.  
**Miki:** Do aradama take the nights off or something?  
**Mihono:** Well, we still get tons of missions at night too... And then it gets really hard waking up the next day...  
**Miki:** Ahaha, toji sure have it rough too, huh.  
**Mihono:** --!? That meow just now!!  
**Miki:** Mihono?  
**Mihono:** I feel like it came from that way... Let's go and check, Miki-san!  
**Mihono:** Meowww, meowww. Where are you, kitty-?  
**Miki:** You heard it from over here, right?  
**Mihono:** Yeah! I'm pretty sure it's right around here...  
**Mihono:** There they are!  
**Miki:** Where, where!?  
**Mihono:** Right here! There's two of them, Miki-san!  
**Miki:** Ah, I see them! They're so cute!  
**Mihono:** Yeah!  
**Mihono:** Will you let me pet you, meow-?  
**Cat:** ...  
**Mihono:** Ah, she turned her head away...  
**Miki:** Ahaha, looks like she's telling you no.  
**Mihono:** Yeah...  
**Mihono:** Hey, they ran off!  
**Miki:** They looked like they were strays, so maybe they were being cautious of you?  
**Mihono:** Yeah, I just wanted to pet them...  
**Mihono:** Next time I find them, I'm gonna pet them for sure!  
**Miki:** Ahaha, I'm rooting for you!  
**Mihono:** We didn't find any geregere slime, but this was pretty fun, huh Miki-san!  
**Miki:** It was!  
**Miki:** The ramen tasted really good, and the cats... well, it's too bad about that.  
**Miki:** I wouldn't mind going on another walk at night with you, Mihono!  
**Mihono:** Sure! Let's go do this again!

## [Resort Dress - Mihono: Start]: It's Not There!!
**Mihono:** This'll definitely look good on you, Akira-san!!  
**Akira:** Huhh!? Quit screwin' with me! Like hell I'd wear that!!  
**Mihono:** I'm not screwing with you! I want you to try on some cute clothes too!  
**Akira:** How dumb are you!? It's not gonna look any good! I'm into rough and ready kinda clothes, okay!  
**Mihono:** Kiyoka says just cause you like something doesn't mean that's all you look good in! There could be a bunch of clothes you'd like but won't try just cause you think they won't work!  
**Akira:** What does that have to do with anything!?  
**Mihono:** What's wrong with trying!  
**Mihono:** We're here on vacation, so you should try on some clothes you've never tried before!  
**Akira:** I only came here cause I had a mission to!  
**Mihono:** But you already finished with that, right? And you even came shopping with me now!  
**Akira:** Yeah, but... Look, just forget about me and pick your own clothes! Like here, wouldn't this look good on you!  
**Mihono:** Ugh...  
**Akira:** Nn? Why'd you get all quiet... Something wrong?  
**Mihono:** I don't have all that much money... Only enough to buy one thing, but I can't pick just one...  
**Mihono:** So I'm stuck on this.  
**Akira:** Don't be. I know you'd look great in any of these. Just buy whichever you want.  
**Mihono:** ...You want to get this over with already, don't you?  
**Akira:** Oh yeah I do.  
**Mihono:** I knew it! You have that same look Fukki gets when she doesn't care anymore!  
**kira:** Oh yeah, her, she has that feeling like she just puts on whatever too.  
**Mihono:** She might seem like that, but even Kiyoka says Fukki's got great fashion sense!  
**Akira:** What're you looking proud about that for.  
**Mihono:** Ehehe... But still, what do I do. I want this... I want it, but...  
**Akira:** (Phew, I somehow got out of that one.)  
**Akira:** (Though... those clothes from before were pretty cute...)  
**Mihono:** Wait?  
**Akira:** What now?  
**Mihono:** Huh? Huhhh? My wallet's...  
**Akira:** Your wallet? What about it? Didn't have as much cash as you thought?  
**Mihono:** ...It's gone.  

## [Resort Dress - Mihono: End]: Don't Make Me Say It!
**Mihono:** It's gone? It's gone! It's gone!? No matter where I look, my wallet's goneeee!!  
**Akira:** Huhh!? You had it at lunch, didn't you!?  
**Mihono:** But now I can't find it anywhereee... Arghh, where could I have dropped it...  
**Akira:** No point in standing around asking that here.  
**Mihono:** But...  
**Akira:** I'm gonna go check the police box, you go check the way we came.  
**Akira:** We'll meet up later.  
**Mihono:** O-Okay! Thanks!  
**Akira:** Alright, before I hit up the police box...  
**Mihono:** It wasn't where we ate lunch either; where'd I even drop it...  
**Akira:** Mihono!  
**Mihono:** Akira-san! Was it at the...  
**Akira:** They didn't have it. What about you?  
**Mihono:** I couldn't find it here either... I even went to all the places we stopped by...  
**Akira:** ...Oh.  
**Mihono:** Where did you go after the police box, Akira-san...?  
**Akira:** I went to buy this, then I went looking for your wallet too.  
**Mihono:** This? ...Ah, that's one of the outfits I wasn't sure if I should buy...  
**Akira:** I picked this out of all of them. Not gonna complain about it, are ya?  
**Mihono:** But why...?  
**Akira:** It's bad enough you lost your wallet, not getting to buy what you wanted's even worse. So here, cheer up.  
**Mihono:** Thanks a lot... I feel a little better now. But... we still haven't found my wallet, so I feel kinda mixed up. Ehehe.  
**Akira:** Well sure. Let's trace our steps again; we'll go together this time...  
**Akira:** Nn? Hirona? Hey, what're you calling for?  
**Hirona:** Akira-san, you're with Asakura-san today, aren't you?  
**Akira:** Mihono? Yeah, she's here, why?  
**Hirona:** I tried calling her over and over, but she won't answer. I guess she's panicking since she lost her wallett.  
**Akira:** Yeah, probably... Why do you know about that?  
**Hirona:** Actually, I picked up Asakura-san's wallet. I'll bring it to you right awayy.  
**Akira:** ...Sure, that'll be great.  
**Akira:** Oi, Mihono. Hirona found your wallet. Says she'll bring it right here.  
**Mihono:** Hirona did!? Thank goodness... Ah, when I get my wallet, I'll pay you back for...  
**Akira:** Don't need it.  
**Mihono:** Eh, but...  
**Akira:** I went and got you a present, so don't go saying something dumb like that.  
**Mihono:** ...Alright!! Thanks a lot!!

## [Another - Mihono: Start]: IF ~Awakening~
*This is--*

  
**Kanayamahime:** I am sorry, Mihono.  
**Mihono:** What're you apologizing for?  

*What might have happened--*

  
**Kanayamahime:** I am sorry.  
**Mihono:** Come on already, Kanayamahime!   
**Mihono:** There's nothing to apologize for! I should be thanking you if anything!  
**Kanayamahime:** Mihono...  

*A story of "what if"--*

  
**Mihono:** Because of you, I got this much stronger!  
**Kanayamahime:** ...  


*Had Asakura Mihono succumbed to Kagutsuchi--*

  
**Mihono:** I mean, why didn't you tell me Kagutsuchi's power was this awesome before?  
**Mihono:** If I'd have known I'd been this powerful, I wouldn't have had anything to worry about!  
**Kanayamahime:** Mihono... That's wrong. This is wrong...  
**Mihono:** Ahh, I want to show off how strong I am already! I could fight the whole investigation team!  
**Kanayamahime:** This is wrong... That's not... Mihono...  
**Mihono:** Nothing's wrong with it, Kanayamahime. That's what I've got this power for, right?  
**Kanayamahime:** Mihono...  
**Kanayamahime:** I am sorry...  
**Mihono:** Seriously. I told you to stop apologizing. If you're not gonna cut it out... do I have to kill you too?  
**Kanayamahime:** ......  
**Kanayamahime:** (I must have made a mistake. I thought to at least leave Mihono her own will, with the last of my strength...)  
**Mihono:** I'm just kidding! So, stop looking like that. Okay?  
**Kanayamahime:** ...Please go back. To the old Mihono...  
**Mihono:** The old Mihono...? I'm still just me?  
**Chie:** Mihono-chan...?  
**Kiyoka:** Hono-chan! Can you hear us?  
**Yui:** Come back to us, Mihono-chan!  
**Hana:** Mihono!  
**Kofuki:** If you don't get your ass back here, I'm not messing around with you anymore, Mihocchi!  
**Mihono:** I can hear everybody... I've gotta go, Kanayamahime!  
**Mihono:** They're all waiting on me!  
**Kanayamahime:** Please don't go, Mihono!    

## [Another - Mihono: End]: IF ~Prayer~
*Several weeks later.*

  
**Aradama:** OOOOOOOOOOO!!  
**Mihono:** Found you, aradama! Alright, let's go!  
**Aradama:** GYAAAAAA...  
**Mihono:** Yep, that's a lot of noro. Okay, in it goes-.  
**Mihono:** .........  
**Mihono:** ...Mm, thanks. Now I'm feeling even stronger!  
**Unit Leader:** We've located Great Aradama Kanayamahime! Now commencing suppression!  
**Unit Member:** Roger!  
**Mihono:** Really; again?  
**Toji A:** KYA--!?  
**Mihono:** It's fine if it's a strong toji, like Kanami or somebody, but when they're weak it's just boring.  
**Mihono:** This was fun at first, but I'm already tired of it.  
**Toji B:**  UWAHH!?  
**Mihono:** So, go and tell Akane-sama or Yukari-sama or whoever.  
**Mihono:** Get me Kanami, or Juujou-san, or Tsubakuro-san, or even the investigation team!  
**Toji C:** KYAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!?  
**Mihono:** Ah, I went and killed the girl who was supposed to tell them.  
**Mihono:** Heyyy, any of you still awake out there-?  
**Toji:** ...  
**Mihono:** Hmm... Well, whatever.  
**Mihono:** There'll be more of them, so I can just tell them again then!  
**Mihono:** Hopefully there's somebody a little more worth killing next time!  
**Kanayamahime:** Mihono...   
**Kanayamahime:** I may have been wrong after all. To keep only your will safe from Kagutsuchi...  
**Kanayamahime:** Your heart was once so pleasant... Now all that remains in it is an all-consuming flame.  
**Kanayamahime:** Even still, I... I didn't wish to forsake it. My promise with the Atago...  
**Kanayamahime:** I wished to protect Mihono...  
**Kanayamahime:** To you miko. Any who can. Please, stop Mihono.  
**Kanayamahime:** Please, one day... return Mihono to herself...  Accomplish what I could not...  
**Kanayamahime:** One day...

## [Joint Raid Event #13: Another Mihono]: 1: Another End
*This is a story of what could have been.*

  
*Another series of events concerning Asakura Mihono and Kanayamahime.*

  
**Mihono:** Guys... I'm fine now!  
**Kiyoka:** ...Hono-chan! We were so worried about you.  
**Mihono:** Ahaha, sorry about that, Kiyoka.  
**Hana:** That's... Mihono alright.  
**Yui:** Yeah... Ahhh... Thank godd...  
**Chie:** Mihono-chan, does it hurt anywhere? Do you feel funny?  
**Mihono:** I'm fine, I'm fine! I feel great! And anyway, Chii-nee.  
**Chie:** Hm?  
**Mihono:** If you keep standing there, you're gonna get hurt?  
**Chie:** Eh?  
**Everyone:** !?  
**Chie:** ...Mihono-ch...?  
**Yui:** Chie-san!? Why!? Why would you do that to her!!  
**Mihono:** Why? Cause I wanted to kill her... I guess!  
**Mirja:** Get back, Yamashiro Yui!!  
**Mirja:** Ggh... Are you, alright...?  
**Yui:** Y-Yeah... but, Mirja-san, you're--!!  
**Akira:** ORAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!  
**Mihono:** Whoa.  
**Mihono:** Geez, what'd you come at me like that for? That's dangerous.  
**Kiyoka:** P-Please, stop it!! That's Hono-chan!!  
**Akira:** Dumbass! What about that is Mihono!? That's... just Kanayamahime!!  
**Kiyoka:** ...!  
**Akira:** Forget it; if you're just gonna stand around, go get Chie and Mirja out of here!!  
**Ellen:** ...Akira's right. Kaoru, give me a hand with them.  
**Kaoru:** ...Yeah.  
**Mai:** I'll help with them too!  
**Mai:** Kanami-chan, Hiyori-chan, Sayaka-chan. I know it'll be hard, but... Could you three handle Mihono-chan.  
**Sayaka:** ...Okay.  
**Hiyori:** ......Kanami.  
**Kanami:** ......  
**Mihono:** Time out, time out!  
**Mihono:** Even I couldn't take on all of you at once right now!  
**Akira:** You think we're letting you get away?  
**Mihono:** Mmm... Yeah! I think I can get away, at least.  
**Mihono:** So anyway... Later, guys. I'll get even stronger next time we see each other!  

## [Joint Raid Event #13: Another Mihono]: 2: Each of Their Feelings
*Several weeks later.*

  
**Toji:** She's just... too much...  
**Mihono:** Hmm, it's hard to tell how much stronger I'm getting just from cutting up weak people.  
**Mihono:** Maybe it's about time I went to see everybody.  
**Yui:** Hey again-.  
**Mirja:** Yamashiro Yui. I'm sure I told you there's no need for you to visit me anymore?  
**Yui:** I'm not the kind of girl who'd stop coming to see you just because you said I didn't have to.  
**Mirja:** Of course not...  
**Mirja:** ...I heard about it. There's been more victims.  
**Yui:** ...  
**Mirja:** Great aradama Kanayamahime is only getting stronger. There's no time for you to waste--  
**Yui:** Please, just stop!!  
**Mirja:** ...  
**Yui:** Do we have to talk about that? Couldn't we talk about something nicer?  
**Mirja:** ...  
**Mirja:** ...Would this have been easier for you if I hadn't saved you from Kanayamahime then?  
**Yui:** --!  
**Yui:** ...Maybe. If you hadn't... I wouldn't have been put on the Kanayamahime suppression assignment, would I.  
**Mirja:** Yamashiro Yui...  
**Yui:** I'm just kidding! So please, don't look so sad. You're ruining your beautiful face, okay?  
**Mirja:** ...Will you be able to destroy Kanayamahime?  
**Yui:** I'll be saving her.  
**Mirja:** ...Huh?  
**Yui:** Ever since that day, there's been more and more reports of aradama outbreaks, hasn't there?  
**Yui:** Yesterday, I went to see Miku... my little sister, in the hospital. And, everybody there was so afraid...  
**Yui:** There's no way Mihono-chan wants things to be like this. So, I'm going to save her.  
**Yui:** No matter... how this all turns out.  
**Mirja:** ...I see.  
**Kofuki:** So? How long're you gonna keep moping around here for?  
**Kiyoka:** ...  
**Kofuki:** Like, if you hate it that much, just get yourself taken off the assignment.  
**Kiyoka:** ...Are you really okay with this, Kofuki-san?  
**Kofuki:** Why wouldn't I be?  
**Kiyoka:** That's... horrible of you...  
**Tsugumi:** Shichinosato-san can be a very stubborn person, can't she-.  
**Kofuki:** ...The hell's that supposed to mean.  
**Tsugumi:** ...If you were your usual self, you would have run out looking for her as soon as you could, wouldn't you?  
**Tsugumi:** And yet, even while you keep saying it's just another mission, you've been spending all this time keeping Musumi-san company.  
**Kofuki:** Don't talk like... you...  
**Tsugumi:** Did you not want to go have fun with Kanayamahime?  
**Kofuki:** ...I don't know, okay...  
**Kiyoka:** Kofuki-san...  
**Kiyoka:** ...That's right. None of us want to have to...  
**Kiyoka:** Eh?  
**Kofuki:** Huh?  
**Kiyoka/Kofuki:** --!!  
**Tsugumi:** What is it?  
**Kiyoka:** It's about Chie-san, in the hospital...  
**Kofuki:** ...It says she disappeared out of her room.  

## [Joint Raid Event #13: Another Mihono]: 3: To Save You
**Chie:** [pant pant]... Just hold on, Mihono-chan...! I'm coming... to save you!  
**Aradama:** OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!  
**Chie:** Aradama...!? Why now...!?  
**Chie:**  Kh...!  
**???:** You're not gonna be able to cut anything swinging like that. And hey, you're in our way.  
**Aradama:** Oooo...  
**Mihono:** It's been a while, Chii-nee! You're moving pretty badly though; you doing okay?  
**Chie:** Mihono-chan...? Why are you...?  
**Mihono:** Why what? I'm here to kill everybody.  
**Chie:** ...Oh.  
**Chie:** Mihono-chan... I'll... save you, okay.  
**Mihono:** Eh; you wanna do it right now? It seems like it'd be pretty boring though... You should make sure you're better first, and then we can do it.  
**Chie:** ......  
**Mihono:** Well, okay. We can do it now if you want.  
**???:** MIHOCCHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII!!  
**Mihono:** --!?  
**Kofuki:** Get the hell away from Chichie, Mihocchi.  
**Mihono:** Fukki! And everybody else too!  
**Kiyoka:** Are you alright, Chie-san?  
**Mirja:** You're supposed to be recovering... Please don't do something so reckless again.  
**Chie:** ...I'm sorry. But... I wanted to stop Mihono-chan.  
**Mihono:** Ahah. I wasn't really feeling it with just Chii-nee, but you guys are gonna make this exciting!  
**Yui:** I thought I was ready for this, but... It's kind of sudden, Mihono-chan.  
**Chie:** It's alright, Yui-chan.  
**Chie:** ...I'll be the one to do it. So... please, all of you. Help me.
