Aradama-chan-! Don&#x27;t be shy-! C&#x27;mon out and play already-!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Kofuki.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...What?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Be quiet. I can&#x27;t hear the aradama&#x27;s movements.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Huhh? If they were that close, the spectrum finder&#x27;d tell us.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Man, today&#x27;s not my day. Of all people, why&#x27;d you have to follow me around?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> It&#x27;s an order.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Oh, is it really? I get that, Sayaka! But whenever you&#x27;re around, you steal my kills! So just don&#x27;t do anything today. Got that!?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Nn! In fact, you just head back home already. That way, I get all the aradama for me...<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> There...! Their numbers are a little more than predicted.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Fine by me, the more the merrier! Finally felt like showing yourselves, huh!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Looks like... 8 coming from the north, 5 coming from the south. Okay, I&#x27;ll take north.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> I&#x27;ll go south.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> And don&#x27;t mess with my aradama!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Kofuki. One of mine is headed north.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Leave it to me. C&#x27;mon, aradama! I love you too!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Two more, headed north.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Eh? F-Fine, I&#x27;ll take care of it...<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Another one.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> H-Hey, Sayaka.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...You should be able to beat them, Kofuki. That&#x27;s all that&#x27;s left.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> I don&#x27;t really love aradama, so. If you want to fight them, I&#x27;ll let you.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...H-Heheh! Sounds like you&#x27;re finally getting it! Hear that! I get you all to myself, aradama-chan!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Pant... Too bad. It&#x27;s already over, huh.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Then, let&#x27;s take a break. Take a seat, Sayaka.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...Break? Were there too many aradama?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> No such thing. I could&#x27;ve kept going if I hadn&#x27;t killed them all. You got that, right?<br>
<em>Kofuki sits down</em></p><p><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm. I thought you could beat them, so I sent them to you.<br>
<em>Sayaka moves over to Kofuki</em></p><p><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Kuku, you catch on quick. But, aren&#x27;t you tired too?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> After you sent them all to me, I started getting extra careful not to screw up my stance or utsushi.<br>
<em>Sayaka sits down</em></p><p><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Ah, but it&#x27;s not like I had to. I killed them all no sweat; not a scratch on me.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...Anyway, I didn&#x27;t think you really weren&#x27;t gonna do anything.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...... <em>smiling</em><br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> You know, you&#x27;re not all that bad.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ......<br>
<em>Sayaka slumps into Kofuki</em></p><p><strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...Wha, are you sleeping...? Hey! Don&#x27;t fall asleep on me! Sayaka!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Nn......<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> D-Don&#x27;t look so peaceful... Hey, Sayaka! Get off already-!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="2-classmates"></a>2: Classmates<a class="hash-link" href="#2-classmates" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Nagasaki Sumi:</strong> Ehh! Ehhh!? Wh-Why&#x27;re the aradama coming after me...!?<br>
<strong>Sumi:</strong> No way! No way, no way! Someone, h-help!!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> I&#x27;ll deal with the aradama on the right. You handle the left.<br>
<strong>Sumi:</strong> I-I-Itomi-san...! I can&#x27;t! I was just supposed to be observing from the back today! I can&#x27;t just start fighting like this!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...Okay. If any come after you, just try to stop them. Stay in the back.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...They&#x27;re all taken care of.<br>
<strong>Sumi:</strong> Ahh, finally. Sorry, and thank you.<br>
<strong>Sumi:</strong> They said I&#x27;d just be observing, so I didn&#x27;t expect real aradama to pop out at me like that. My hands are still shaking...<br>
<strong>Sumi:</strong> ...You&#x27;re amazing, Itomi-san. You&#x27;re seriously strong.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Sumi:</strong> I can&#x27;t believe we&#x27;re in the same year. The way you moved, I couldn&#x27;t do that. It really takes something special to fight on the front lines, huh.<br>
<strong>Sumi:</strong> I could never fight like that. Maybe I&#x27;m not cut out to be a toji...<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...Never? I think you just need to practice more.<br>
<strong>Sumi:</strong> Ugh... M-Mm. Maybe. I really should practice some more.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> You should commit to your attacks more too.<br>
<strong>Sumi:</strong> Ugh... You have a point there, I think.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> And you change stances too slowly.<br>
<strong>Sumi:</strong> Mm... You&#x27;re right.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> And you&#x27;re bad at keeping track of your surroundings.<br>
<strong>Sumi:</strong> Right... I knew it, but, it seems like all I have are bad points.<br>
<strong>Sumi:</strong> When I was chosen to be a member of the observation team, everyone just assumed I&#x27;d be strong because I&#x27;m so tall...<br>
<strong>Sumi:</strong> But with me like I am, if they send me on a mission... I don&#x27;t think I could even cut an aradama.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...But you did cut one earlier.<br>
<strong>Sumi:</strong> Earlier? Ahh, I just got carried away. Cutting it was... Just a fluke.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> I didn&#x27;t think you were too bad with a sword.<br>
<strong>Sumi:</strong> Eh...?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Your swordsmanship was good. But, if you put more force into your swings, you&#x27;d do even better.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Then you need to change stances faster, and pay more attention to your surroundings.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Itomi-san...<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> I practiced a lot, until I was able to do more and more. So I think you should practice a lot too.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Do you want to practice together sometime?<br>
<strong>Sumi:</strong> Eh, with me!?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm. Whenever I don&#x27;t have a mission.<br>
<strong>Sumi:</strong> Do you really think I can improve?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm. You&#x27;re lacking in a lot of areas, but I think so.<br>
<strong>Sumi:</strong> A... A lot, huh. But, thank you, Itomi-san. For encouraging me.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Eh...?<br>
<strong>Sumi:</strong> I feel a bit better. I&#x27;m looking forward to training together.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...O-Okay.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="3-where-these-feelings-reach"></a>3: Where These Feelings Reach<a class="hash-link" href="#3-where-these-feelings-reach" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Takatsu Yukina:</strong> ...Sayaka!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Ah... President Takatsu. I-<br>
<strong>Yukina:</strong> So you&#x27;re back. The mission this time involved a fairly large scale aradama, but you defeated it rather easily, didn&#x27;t you?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Ah, yes... Nothing went wrong...<br>
<strong>Yukina:</strong> Well done. Even Yukari-sama offered her praise. I&#x27;m very proud of you.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Yukina:</strong> And the elite guard looked so ashamed. Fufu. You really did well today.<br>
<strong>Yukina:</strong> Now, Sayaka. You must be tired, so rest.<br>
<strong>Yukina:</strong> Ah... That&#x27;s right. Take this.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Eh...? A box of... Candy...?<br>
<strong>Yukina:</strong> Yes. It was delivered as a gift, but I have no interest in it. You should have them.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> I-I...<br>
<strong>Yukina:</strong> Go ahead. The sugar should help you recover as well.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...Thank you, very much.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> P-President, um... I&#x27;m very happy...<br>
<strong>Yukina:</strong> Ahh, of course, you must be excited to sortie again. I wonder if I can&#x27;t arrange something soon.<br>
<strong>Yukina:</strong> With my Renpu students constantly proving their usefulness, it&#x27;s only a matter of time before Yukari-sama realizes the incompetence of her elite guard.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Yukina:</strong> The boorish Shidou Maki, that stuck up Konohana Suzuka, the impertinent Tsubakuro Yume, and--<br>
<strong>Yukina:</strong> That utterly worthless Yomi. I feel ashamed whenever I&#x27;m reminded she graduated from Renpu.<br>
<strong>Yukina:</strong> But don&#x27;t worry, Sayaka. I won&#x27;t allow you to turn out like that failure.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...Right.<br>
<strong>Yukina:</strong> You are the ultimate toji. The only one fit to guard Yukari-sama.<br>
<strong>Yukina:</strong> And, for that purpose, I need you to abandon any pointless feelings or desires. You cannot allow them to interfere with your duties.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Yukina:</strong> Now then, Sayaka, I&#x27;ll speak to you later.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Abandon any... Pointless feelings.<br>

<strong>Sayaka:</strong> I don&#x27;t want to lose this feeling. I want to be with Mai, who was kind to me.<br>
<strong>Yukina:</strong> ...Sayaka. You aren&#x27;t a defective product like the elite guard. You are the successor to Myoho Muramasa.<br>

<strong>Sakura:</strong> ...Cat food, I think?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Where... Can I buy that?<br>
<strong>Sakura:</strong> Probably everywhere? At convenience stores, at least.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> I&#x27;ll buy some...!<br>
<strong>Sakura:</strong> Fufu. Aren&#x27;t you lucky, kitty. A kind person saved you... Do you think you&#x27;ll get better soon?<br>

<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...I&#x27;ve been here before.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> That&#x27;s correct. They said they were experiencing trouble, and made a polite appeal, or rather, a request to us.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Ooh, there&#x27;s more aradama-chan here!? Well aren&#x27;t we lucky!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> No, it isn&#x27;t that kind of trouble. They requested a stuntman for their film.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Huh?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...Stuntman?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> That&#x27;s right.<br>
<strong>Assistant Director:</strong> Ah, it&#x27;s a good thing you toji girls are here. A strange rumor started up that aradama show up in our studio, and it&#x27;s been giving us problems... Serious problems.<br>
<strong>Assistant Director:</strong> They say there&#x27;s a high chance of people getting hurt doing stunts here if any aradama come out. Stuntmen are turning us down... All of them, in fact.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> That doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s something you ask us to do though. I&#x27;m not doing it either.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Shichinosato Kofuki, I understand your complaint. However, this is an issue that could be considered secondary damages caused by aradama.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Secondary damages?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Secondary damages can happen in a variety of ways. This would be considered a case of harmful misinformation.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Aradama are not commonly appearing here at the moment, but because that has happened in the past, as the director says, unfortunate rumors begin to arise.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> We won&#x27;t be capable of supporting them for years to come, but, whenever possible, it should be our policy to assist them.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Damnit... Making me do the annoying jobs.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mai told me about it. We have to boost the image of toji.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> In simpler terms, that&#x27;s exactly right.<br>
<strong>Assistant Director:</strong> With that cleared up, we&#x27;d like to ask you to be our stuntman... Considering your physique, would you be able to do it?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> You want me to do it?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> I can&#x27;t do anything like acting...<br>
<strong>Assistant Director:</strong> You won&#x27;t need to say any lines.<br>
<strong>Assistant Director:</strong> What we want is for you to film you leaping around and jumping off rooftops. It seems like the director had seen toji fighting aradama before, and came up with the idea for this request.<br>
<strong>Assistant Director:</strong> We can&#x27;t afford to delay shooting any longer, and with our lack of time, budget, and suspicious circumstances, we can&#x27;t arrange to find new stuntmen, so please!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...What should I do? Kofuki, Mirja...<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Do whatever you want. If you don&#x27;t want to, then say no.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> If there&#x27;s something I can do to help... I want to do it. I don&#x27;t know if I can do it right though...<br>
<strong>Assistant Director:</strong> Thank you! Really, thank you so much!<br>
<strong>Assistant Director:</strong> Here, the director and film crew are waiting over this way. We can go over the details with them.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Who&#x27;d have thought she&#x27;d end up being in a movie, huh-. Even Sayaka must be pretty shocked right about now.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I&#x27;d imagine so. Though, I was somewhat surprised that Itomi Sayaka decided on it herself.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Well, yeah.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> And also, you have a fairly caring side yourself, to stay to look after her when we aren&#x27;t even sure of when the filming will end.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> That&#x27;s just cause, if I went back, it&#x27;s not like there&#x27;s anything to do there either.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I see. At any rate, the filming should be beginning shortly.   </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="shinsengumi---sayaka-end-a-true-to-life-take"></a>[Shinsengumi - Sayaka: End]: A True to Life Take<a class="hash-link" href="#shinsengumi---sayaka-end-a-true-to-life-take" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Film Director:</strong> ...Action, start!<br>

<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Hah!<br>
<strong>Ronin A:</strong> Kh... As if I&#x27;ll go getting caught here.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> (Turn around... Face the camera, and act as though you&#x27;re striking someone... One.)<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> YAH!<br>
<strong>Ronin B:</strong> Run away, run away... Everybody split up!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> (When that person runs, chase him.)<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> (Come around right in front of him, and point the tip of my sword toward him... Then done.)<br>
<strong>Ronin B:</strong> Eee!?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> She&#x27;s actually not doing that bad.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> It should be no difficulty at all for her to jump about and wield an imitation sword like that.<br>
<strong>Film Director:</strong> CUUUUUUUT!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Yo, nice going. What was it like? Giving that a try.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> I only... did the things they told me to do.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> It&#x27;s different, from fighting against aradama or in a sparring match... It felt a little strange.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Even so, you performed it expertly. That haori fit you well too.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> I couldn&#x27;t tell for myself, but that&#x27;s good.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> That director and assistant director made it clear they were very grateful, so it seems they thought it was a great performance.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> They said they were highly impressed you were able to do those movements without the help of wires.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> And that they might come asking for your help again.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...I won&#x27;t do this again. I was a little nervous after all.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> That&#x27;s just cause nothing beats going up against aradama-chan.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> That reminds me, they said they would send us movie tickets.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> All we can do now is pray the filming is finished without incident, so the film can be opened to the public.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm. If this can help boost the image of toji... I&#x27;ll be glad.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I&#x27;m sure you won&#x27;t have to worry about that, Itomi Sayaka.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> There&#x27;s nothing left to do here, so lets go home already.  </p><div class="videoWrapper"><iframe width="640" height="480" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A8mB5sp3tpA"></iframe></div><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="ceremonial-dress---misogi-start-lacking-the-words"></a>[Ceremonial Dress - Misogi: Start]: Lacking the Words<a class="hash-link" href="#ceremonial-dress---misogi-start-lacking-the-words" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Toji A:</strong> What now...

<strong>Mai:</strong> Everyone finished evacuating, so let&#x27;s hold our formation and take them out.<br>

<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mai.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Why did you run off and break formation?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...? ...I made sure to kill all the aradama.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> That&#x27;s true. You did defeat the aradama. Still, you might be strong, Sayaka-chan, but you&#x27;re not supposed to fight on your own.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> And you were even hurt a little.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> I thought this would be the fastest...<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> You have to exorcise rampaging aradama as fast as you can.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Mmm... That&#x27;s not what I mean though.<br>

<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Oh, there you are, Sayaka. So, what happened?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...Kaoru, there&#x27;s something I need your help with.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> So you got told off by Mai during a mission yesterday, then you ran away, and now it&#x27;s hard to talk to her like usual?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> With things like this... I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m supposed to do.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> I know you want to make up with her. But, why did you do something reckless like fighting the aradama by yourself?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Because I want to be stronger. So nobody has to go through anything painful.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Well, Mai said she&#x27;s worried about you too.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mai did...?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> She isn&#x27;t... Mad at me?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> I mean, of course she&#x27;s mad when you put yourself in danger. But it&#x27;s not like she&#x27;s mad because she hates you now.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Kaoru... I want to be with Mai like I used to.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> If you think you did something wrong, then tell her you&#x27;re sorry. After that, tell her how you feel. Then you&#x27;ll make up.<br>

<strong>Mai:</strong> No, I should apologize too.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> To tell the truth, Kaoru-chan told me about how she spoke with you. But still... I couldn&#x27;t make up with you right away...<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> No, that was my fault.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> I never had any friends before, so I didn&#x27;t know how to make up after we fought.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> But I also should have explained sooner why I was warning you yesterday. Then there wouldn&#x27;t have been this misunderstanding.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mai. I... I want to get even stronger. So, what happened yesterday... I might do it again.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> In that case, we should get stronger together.<br>

<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Lazy river pool?<br>

Do you remember the director from that historical film?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> I remember.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> As it turns out, that director has sent in another offer. He requested you, myself, and Iwakura Sanae.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> I didn&#x27;t plan on being in any more movies after that.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> That may be so, but, those at the top... Or rather, the public relations department is fairly eager to accept this.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I understand how you feel, but is there any way you could lend us your assistance?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...I&#x27;ll do it if it&#x27;s just a little.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Thank you very much. I think they&#x27;ll be able to meet that expectation of yours.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> The role you will be playing is that of a younger nun under my guidance, so you shouldn&#x27;t need to say many lines.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Now then, why don&#x27;t we go visit Iwakura Sanae.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Eh, you want me to be in a movie with you and Itomi-san? I&#x27;ll be in a movie!?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> It&#x27;s only natural to be surprised. However, this too is a part of our duties as toji.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> But, can I really do something like that...?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> We&#x27;ll do our best together.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Itomi-san. It&#x27;s amazing how you can be totally calm here.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> This is the second time for me. And also, this is an important mission.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> That&#x27;s true. This will be my first time acting, but I&#x27;ll do it as best as I can.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> According to the project outline and the script, it should be a horror action film.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> The plot features a pair of young nuns who go to exterminate a centuries old black cat demon living in a ruined mansion.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> I&#x27;ll be playing the younger nun.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Then that means, I&#x27;m the one who&#x27;s playing the black cat demon?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Yes. I&#x27;m not sure exactly why you were chosen for the part, but that director is one to set his heart on something and not let go.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> I think you&#x27;ll be a cute black cat.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> But it&#x27;s a horror movie... Is that really okay?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> That shouldn&#x27;t be an issue. Judging from the photos of costumes that they sent us, they don&#x27;t look designed to be scary.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> They&#x27;re cute.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> The nun clothes have a stylish feeling to them. I bet they&#x27;d look good on you two.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Before the filming takes place, I plan to hold rehearsal sessions and briefing sessions with the director when there&#x27;s time between missions.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Aradama suppression will be my highest priority of course, but I&#x27;ll make my efforts here as well.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm. We should make the best use of our experience and bearing as toji.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Much like with their offer with the historical film, they must be expecting a similar kind of action from us.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> In that case, I think I might be able to do some of it.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Don&#x27;t worry. I know you can do it, Sanae.<br>

<strong>Film Director:</strong> Yes, that&#x27;s right. There&#x27;s a few lines for you to say, but the most important part is the scream.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...The scream?<br>
<strong>Film Director:</strong> In this scene, just before you climb the ladder to the next floor, you see the shadow of the black cat, and I want you to scream as loud as you can.<br>

<strong>Film Director:</strong> Sure, sure. I can already tell I made the right call requesting you three! Anyway, we&#x27;ll talk later.<br>

<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...Like that?<br>

<strong>Mirja:</strong> That&#x27;s reasonable advice to give.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Gyaa-!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...How was that?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Hmm... Instead of sounding so rough, something like, &quot;Kyaa-!&quot;... It may be better to make it sound cuter like that.<br>

<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm, I feel hungry too. It&#x27;s smelled good for a while here.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Fufu, you&#x27;re right about that. Let&#x27;s go see what they have then.  </p><div class="videoWrapper"><iframe width="640" height="480" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3onVkXoPxgw"></iframe></div><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="valentines-21---sayaka-start-disconcerting-chocolates"></a>[Valentines &#x27;21 - Sayaka: Start]: Disconcerting Chocolates<a class="hash-link" href="#valentines-21---sayaka-start-disconcerting-chocolates" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I want to make chocolates.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...Chocolates? Did you bump your head or something? Why bring that up here of all places?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Shichinosato-san might not have any interest in these things, but for the rest of the world, it is Valentines season.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Yeah, I know! What I mean is, why&#x27;d she come to you of all people for advice! Okay!?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> I want to give back to Mai. She&#x27;s always giving them to me.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Oh yeah, she&#x27;s got you hand fed now.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> But still, I get that, but why&#x27;d you come to us?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> I didn&#x27;t mean you, Kofuki. I wanted Tsugumi. I heard that Tsugumi can cook.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Are you sure? The stuff she makes, it&#x27;s... like that, alright?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Don&#x27;t worry, Shichinosato-san. Even I know to mind the TPO.	[Time, place, and occasion]<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Do you...?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I&#x27;ll help you, Itomi-san. Let&#x27;s give it our best attempt.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> I&#x27;ll be in your care.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...Guess if that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s going to be.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Oi! I&#x27;m helping out too! Don&#x27;t go starting this on your own!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> First, we need to gather ingredients.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Okay.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Now, I&#x27;ll stop by the fresh fish corner...<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> You&#x27;re not going anywhere near there!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Sayaka-chan, you&#x27;re with Shichinosato-san and Tsugumi-san? That&#x27;s a bit of an odd combination... or maybe not? You&#x27;re all Renpu toji, after all. Were you out shopping?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> We were going--<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Yeah we were. Just helping with this one&#x27;s research. Right?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Yes, that&#x27;s how it is.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Is that why? Do your best with them, Sayaka-chan.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...Mm.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Kofuki, why did you do that?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Why&#x27;d I make something up? Cause, you don&#x27;t want Mai to know till you give it to her, right?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Hmm...?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> What&#x27;s that look for! Before, Kiyoka kept going on about how girls need surprises or whatever, and I just remembered it is all!!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...Thank you, Kofuki.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> So make some good chocolate and give her a surprise.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="valentines-21---sayaka-end-normal-chocolates"></a>[Valentines &#x27;21 - Sayaka: End]: Normal Chocolates<a class="hash-link" href="#valentines-21---sayaka-end-normal-chocolates" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> It should be fine now. Test chocolate #1 is complete.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> It&#x27;s ready...<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Hmm, it looks okay at least.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> I tried my best for Mai, since she works hard every day.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Now for the taste testing. ...[chew chew]. Mm, it turned out well.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Really?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Yes, you could proudly serve this anywhere...<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> I guess I&#x27;ll give it a taste too then...<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> With its nutritional value.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Pffpphhtt!? This tastes like shit!!!!!!!!!!!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Shichinosato-san... That&#x27;s disgusting.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Hey, I didn&#x27;t do anything wrong here! What the hell happened to TPO; remember TPO!?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> You see-, Itomi-san told me she wanted to make it nutritious-. So yes, I provided some nutritional ingredients from my own private stockpile.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> It would be great for Mai if she&#x27;s tired.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...Sigh.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Oi, Sayaka. What&#x27;re Mai&#x27;s cookies like?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mai&#x27;s cookies are normal cookies. But, they&#x27;re really tasty.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Right? So, quit thinking about nutrition and all that crap and make some normal tasty chocolates too.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> But...<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> No buts. She&#x27;s absolutely gonna be way happier if you give her that instead of something weird.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> It&#x27;ll make Mai happy... Okay, I&#x27;ll make normal chocolates.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I think that would be a good idea too. They say that cooking comes down to love, after all.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...You can just stop talking.  </p><p>Valentines Day.</p><p><strong>Mai:</strong> Ah, Sayaka-chan! Here you go; I made you Valentines chocolates.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Thank you, Mai.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...I made some too.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Eh? Sayaka-chan, you made your own chocolates for me...?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm. Tsugumi and Kofuki helped me, and I tried my best.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> I tried tasting it lots of times. I made sure it was normally tasty chocolate... I think. Do you want to try it?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Thank you, Sayaka-chan.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I&#x27;d be glad to have a bite... Mmm, it&#x27;s so good!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> I&#x27;m happy... Thank you for always helping me, Mai.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations/edit/docs/episodes/Itomi_Sayaka_Episodes.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_2_ui" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_3DPF"></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/tnm-translations/docs/episodes/Yanase_Mai_Episodes/"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Â« Yanase Mai Episodes</div></a></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/tnm-translations/docs/episodes/Mashiko_Kaoru_Episodes/"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Next</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Mashiko Kaoru Episodes Â»</div></a></div></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_35-E thin-scrollbar"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#1-naptime" class="table-of-contents__link">1: Naptime</a></li><li><a href="#2-classmates" class="table-of-contents__link">2: Classmates</a></li><li><a href="#3-where-these-feelings-reach" class="table-of-contents__link">3: Where These Feelings Reach</a></li><li><a href="#4-what-i-dont-want-to-lose" class="table-of-contents__link">4: What I Don&#39;t Want to Lose</a></li><li><a href="#5-feelings-of-wanting-to-save" class="table-of-contents__link">5: Feelings of Wanting to Save</a></li><li><a href="#shinsengumi---sayaka-start-a-sudden-acting-offer" class="table-of-contents__link">Shinsengumi - Sayaka: Start: A Sudden Acting Offer</a></li><li><a href="#shinsengumi---sayaka-end-a-true-to-life-take" class="table-of-contents__link">Shinsengumi - Sayaka: End: A True to Life Take</a></li><li><a href="#ceremonial-dress---misogi-start-lacking-the-words" class="table-of-contents__link">Ceremonial Dress - Misogi: Start: Lacking the Words</a></li><li><a href="#ceremonial-dress---misogi-end-feeling-the-same" class="table-of-contents__link">Ceremonial Dress - Misogi: End: Feeling the Same</a></li><li><a href="#swimsuit-19-start-do-your-best-enjoy-yourself" class="table-of-contents__link">Swimsuit 19: Start: Do Your Best, Enjoy Yourself!</a></li><li><a href="#swimsuit-19-end-will-you-ride-with-me" class="table-of-contents__link">Swimsuit 19: End: Will You, Ride With Me?</a></li><li><a href="#halloween-19---sayaka-start-a-request-offer" class="table-of-contents__link">Halloween 19 - Sayaka: Start: A Request Offer</a></li><li><a href="#halloween-19---sayaka-end-the-scream-is-vital" class="table-of-contents__link">Halloween 19 - Sayaka: End: The Scream is Vital...?</a></li><li><a href="#valentines-21---sayaka-start-disconcerting-chocolates" class="table-of-contents__link">Valentines '21 - Sayaka: Start: Disconcerting Chocolates</a></li><li><a href="#valentines-21---sayaka-end-normal-chocolates" class="table-of-contents__link">Valentines '21 - Sayaka: End: Normal Chocolates</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Links</div><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://pastebin.com/LdyviZ8Z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Translator anon&#x27;s pastebin<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Site source code<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Built with Docusaurus.</div></div></div></footer></div>
