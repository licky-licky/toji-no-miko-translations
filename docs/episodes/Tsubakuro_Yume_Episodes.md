## 1: Meeting Maki
**Maki:** So you're the new addition to the elite guard, Tsubakuro Yume?  
**Maki:** I'm Shidou Maki, the first seat. We'll be working together from now on. Let's get along.  
**Yume:** Onee-san, you won Yukari-sama's tournament twice, right? So you must be really strong. We should fight!  
**Maki:** Right off the bat, huh. Looks like our new recruit's a lively one.  
**Maki:** But unfortunately, I can't right now. There's an aradama suppression mission I need to help with.  
**Yume:** Then I'll go with you. We'll have a fight to see who can beat the most aradama!  
**Maki:** You mean a competition to see who has the highest aradama killcount?  
**Maki:** Sounds interesting enough, but without orders to let you come, I can't let you join my unit.  
**Yume:** Ehh-!? Just for a little while! If you won't let me, I'm gonna follow you anyway, okay!  
**Maki:** Geez, a real lively kid after all... Well, since you're strong enough to make it into the elite guard, you should be able to handle yourself out there.  
**Yume:** Yeah, yeah! I'll be super useful, actually! So let's compete! C'mon, compete with me!  
**Maki:** ...Alright. It seems like a good chance to see what the new recruit's capable of. Okay, I'll accept your challenge!  
**Yume:** Hooray-! After I beat you, Maki onee-san, I'll be the first seat!  
**Yume:** There-! That's the last aradama down-!  
**Maki:** You were incredible, Yume. You must have taken out half the aradama on this mission by yourself.  
**Yume:** Ehehe! So that means I won, right?  
**Maki:** Yep. I didn't get anywhere near as many as you.  
**Yume:** Hooray-! I beat Maki onee-san-!  
**Maki:** I'm surprised by just how strong you are at your age. With you around, the elite guard has a bright future.  
**Yume:** So since I beat you, Maki onee-san, that makes me the first seat now, doesn't it!  
**Maki:** Well no, the seats just show the order everyone joined in. So no matter how strong you are, you're the fourth seat, Yume.  
**Yume:** Huhh!? Really!? I tried so hard, but it's like I still lost-! You should have made it clearer from the start! Sheesh-!  

## 2: Shopping with Yume
**Yume:** Yaaay! We all managed to go shopping together in Harajuku today-!  
**Yomi:** You were very insistent. But I still don't understand why you wanted me to come...  
**Yume:** Because it's more fun with more people!  
**Suzuka:** What a fancy looking shop. Yume, you wanted to buy your Ichigo Daifuku Neko goods here, didn't you?  
**Yume:** Yeah! Stickers for my scabbard, and stuffed animals!  
**Maki:** Just be aware of how much money you have to spend.  
**Yume:** Okaaay! Let's see, I'll get three of this stuffed animal, so I can have each color...  
**Yume:** Oh, but I don't have enough money to get more than one...  
**Maki:** They're just different colors. One should be enough.  
**Yume:** Okay... But they're all so cute. I don't know which one to buy...  
**Maki:** ...Well, if you can't make up your mind, I'll have to buy one of them.  
**Yume:** Really!? Thank you, Maki onee-san!  
**Suzuka:** You're too soft on her, Maki-san... I suppose that leaves me no choice but to buy another one.  
**Yume:** Hooray! That means I can have all of them now! I love you, onee-sans!  
**Suzuka:** A stuffed animal is a small price to pay to see you looking so delighted, Yume.  
**Maki:** Anyway, is there anything else you need? We all came out to Harajuku together, so I'll help you buy whatever you want.  
**Yume:** I only wanted stickers and the stuffed animals today, so I don't need to buy anything else!  
**Maki:** O-Okay, if you're fine with that...  
**Suzuka:** --Ah! I know just the thing!  
**Suzuka:** If that's all you wanted here, why don't we stop by that ice cream shop?  
**Suzuka:** It seems they offer waffle cones? I'll pay for yours!  
**Maki:** I like the sound of that. I'll go order a triple scoop.  
**Suzuka:** Hey, Maki-san! Please don't go stealing your way into my idea!  
**Maki:** Well, the one I'll be getting is a triple scoop of chocolate mint, anyway. Ahahaha.  
**Yume:** Eww, that stuff tastes like toothpaste though! I don't want any-!  
**Yomi:** ...Shidou-san and Konohana-san are like an old couple spoiling their grandchild...  

## 3: Yume's Unreasonable Request
**Yume:** Sigh... This is so boring... Yukari-sama's gone, and the other guards won't play with me...  
**Yume:** Hey-, hey-, Kazumi onee-san and Wakako onee-san. Tell me a funny story.  
**Wakako:** Eh-!? I can't come up with anything when you ask so suddenly...!  
**Kazumi:** I'm sorry. Nothing comes to mind.  
**Yume:** Ehh~!? You two're so lame~! Hmm, then... Tell me if you two have a crush on anyone!  
**Wakako:** Ehh!? W-We don't have to tell you that...  
**Yume:** Huh, what's that? The way you reacted says you do have a crush on someone, right, Wakako onee-san?  
**Wakako:** Ugh...! ...N-No comment.  
**Yume:** Hmm? Fine, be that way. Now it's your turn, Kazumi onee-san!  
**Kazumi:** Maki-sama is the one I long for.  
**Wakako:** Without any hesitation!?  
**Yume:** Eh-! So Kazumi onee-san likes Maki onee-san!  
**Yume:** --Now back to you, Wakako onee-san. Who do you like? Is it someone I know?  
**Yume:** If you don't say who, I'll use my position as the fourth seat of the elite guard to get you fired~.  
**Wakako:** Ughh...!?  
**Wakako:** (I'd rather die than say who, but to get fired over such a reason...)  
**Maki:** --Hey, Yume! Stop bothering them!  
**Yume:** Ah, Maki onee-san!  
**Maki:** I can't believe you. Whenever you don't have a mission, you just go around annoying people. This causes trouble for me too, you know?  
**Yume:** But I'm so bored!  
**Maki:** Really? If you're that bored, then I'll have you cleaning the office daily from now on. I was just looking for someone to take care of that.  
**Yume:** Ehh-!? No way! I don't wanna have to clean the office!  
**Maki:** I know a few other places you can clean then. The entrance hall, the hallways, the bathrooms, and then there's...  
**Yume:** ...I'm leaving-!!  
**Maki:** She ran away, huh.  
**Wakako:** --You scared her off.  
**Kazumi:** You're so dependable, Maki-sama.  

## 4: Yume's Adult Appeal
**Yume:** Aghh-! She told me again that I can't go on a mission because I'm a kid!  
**Yume:** This is so boring! Even though I'm the strongest in the elite guard...!  
**Yume:** I'll just have to show Yukari-sama I can be as adult as anyone else!  
**Yume:** But how do I do that... If I put on makeup, that'd make me look more adult, right?  
**Yume:** --I know! I'll just ask the other guards!  
**Yume:** ...So anyway, what do you all think I need to do to be an adult?  
**Yume:** Starting with Yomi onee-san, what's your idea!  
**Yomi:** ...An adult is someone who pays taxes, aren't they?  
**Suzuka:** That's certainly a very grounded view of it...  
**Maki:** But I can agree with that.  
**Yume:** Well that's easy! I'll make sure to pay taxes! Now it's your turn, Suzuka onee-san!  
**Suzuka:** Being an adult is about the way you speak, isn't it?  
**Suzuka:** Yume speaks in a very childish manner. You should at least speak more respectfully around Yukari-sama.  
**Maki:** That's right. I'd be interested in seeing you try it too.  
**Yume:** Hm, hmm... Last up, Maki onee-san!  
**Maki:** Normally, you'd think someone's a kid because of their height, right?  
**Suzuka:** But Yume can't exactly go about changing that in a single day.  
**Suzuka:** Though if she wears high heels, it could make a slight difference.  
**Yume:** Let's see... So if I put together all your ideas...  
**Yume:** I just need to go to Yukari-sama wearing high heels, and ask something like "Would you please examine this?" while showing her proof I paid taxes!  
**Suzuka:** You should really just give up on this.  

## 5: Yume vs Kanami
**Yume:** --I finally get to fight you, Onee-san. I've been waiting so long for this.  
**Kanami:** You're the one from the elite guard we fought before...! What are you doing here...?  
**Yume:** Wanna fight me, Onee-san? I think you're probably stronger than anyone.  
**Yume:** So if I beat you, no one will be able to forget how amazing I am!  
**Kanam:** ...Mm, okay. I wanted to settle things with you anyway.  
**Yume:** Then let's get started right now!  
**Yume:** --Hah!!  
**Kanami:** So aggressive...! And those pointed strikes...! This is some advanced Ten'nen Rishin-Ryu!  
**Yume:** Ahahahaha-! You're having fun, right-!  
**Kanami:** Yeah! You're really interesting! Now it's my turn--  
**Kanami:** Haaaaaahh-!  
**Yume:** Pant... Pant... ...It's no good. Whatever I do, I can't beat you, Onee-san.  
**Kanami:** You're so strong though, Yume-chan! Fighting you was so much fun!  
**Yume:** ...Mm. I had a lot of fun fighting you too, Onee-san!  
**Kanami:** By the way, those stickers and that strap on your scabbard are super cute! That's Ichigo Daifuku Neko, right?  
**Yume:** Yeah! My onee-sans in the elite guard bought them for me!  
**Yume:** Do you like Ichigo Daifuku Neko too?  
**Kanami:** I love it! I like anything that's cute!  
**Yume:** Really! Then you should come shopping with me next time!  
**Kanami:** Okay! Sounds like fun! I'll invite Mai-chan and Mihono-chan, and we can all go together!  
**Yume:** ...Hey, Onee-san. If we met differently, would we have been friends?  
**Kanami:** Of course we would have! And rivals too!  
**Kanami:** If we went to school together, I'd challenge you to fights every day! I can't wait to see more of your swordsmanship!  
**Yume:** School together... Huh. Fufu... That sounds really fun.  
**Yume:** But that's why... It's too bad... It makes it even worse...  
**Kanami:** What's so bad about it? It's not too late, you know! We can still be friends!  
**Yume:** ...Hey, Onee-san. Don't forget about me, okay...  
**Kanami:** ...I won't! I could never forget you!

## Furisode Part 1: Yume's First Shrine Visit of the Year  
**Yume:** Whoa~, there's so many people. Do we really have to wait in line here?  
**Suzuka:** My, weren't you the one saying you wanted to make your first shrine visit of the year?  
**Yume:** I did, but~... I just wanted to go with you onee-sans.  
**Maki:** In that case, do you want to come back later? I get the feeling we'll freeze standing in line with all these people.  
**Yomi:** I can go buy something to warm us. Ah, they're handing out sweet sake over there.  
**Maki:** Sweet sake...? That sure would warm us right up.  
**Suzuka:** Since we have the opportunity, we may as well take some. I'll go with you, Yomi-san.  
**Yume:** W-Wait, wait, wait! Sweet sake's no good!  
**Suzuka:** Oh, do you not like sweet sake? Perhaps we can find something else for you, Yume.  
**Yume:** That's not what I meant! It's not that I don't want it; it's you onee-sans who can't have it!  
**Suzuka:** But I don't dislike sweet sake?  
**Yume:** You don't understand... Aghh, the shrine visit!  Let's just do the shrine visit already, before more people show up!  
**Yume:** Sigh~, we're finally done~.  
**Yomi:** Was that really enough? You hardly prayed for more than three seconds.  
**Yume:** That's all I needed. I didn't want to wish for anything from the gods anyway.  
**Yume:** Anyhow, Maki-onee-san and Suzuka-onee-san sure are taking their time~.  
**Yomi:** About those two, they asked me to tell you they went looking to buy charms.  
**Yume:** Charms? ...Hehe, then this works out great. Come with me for a minute, Yomi onee-san!   
**Yume:** Now's our chance to get something to eat from the stalls!  
**Yomi:** We're buying something from the stalls?  
**Yume:** Yup! What should we get~? Do you know what Maki-onee-san and Suzuka-onee-san like?    
**Yomi:** I don't. Come to think of it, what do they like to eat?  
**Yume:** Yomi-onee-san, I can't count on you for anything~. Oh well, maybe strawberry mochi will work~.  
**Yomi:** I don't think anyone is selling strawberry mochi... Why did you want to know what the two of them like to eat?  
**Yume:** Hehehe, that's a secret for now~... Oh, I got a great idea! I'll just buy some of everything, and you can help me carry it all, Yomi onee-san.  
**Maki:** Sorry for the wait... Why do you have all that?  
**Suzuka:** Your arms are full with... Is that food?  
**Yume:** Yup. I'm giving all these to you onee-sans, as a gift.  
**Maki:** A gift?  
**Yume:** Thank you, onee-sans. If it weren't for you two, we wouldn't be able to do our first shrine visit together.  
## Furisode Part 2: Thank You  
**Yume:** Thank you, onee-sans. If it weren't for you two, we wouldn't be able to do our first shrine visit together.  
**Maki:** It's rare hearing you say thanks...  
**Yume:** Come on! Just listen to me!  
**Suzuka:** Maki-san, give Yume a chance to talk.   
**Maki:** You're right. Sorry Yume. I didn't mean to make fun of you.  
**Yume:** I'm talking about something serious here, okay?  
**Maki:** I know. I'll hear what you have to say. So Yume, what are you thanking us for?   
**Yume:** Geez, you're so dense~.  
**Yume:** It's because of you onee-sans that I got to do my first shrine visit this year!  
**Yume:** That's why, thanks. It's really fun, visiting the shrine with you!  
**Maki:** ...I see, I'm having fun too, Yume.  
**Suzuka:** And I as well.  
**Yume:** That's good then~. Here! Have as much as you want!  
**Suzuka:** Since Yume went out of her way to buy all this for us, why don't we find somewhere quiet to enjoy it.  
**Yume:** I actually wanted to secretly buy the things you liked, but... I didn't know what to get, so I just bought a whole lot of stuff.  
**Suzuka:** Fufu, that's very like you. Thank you, Yume.  
**Suzuka:** There's nothing I'd like more than whatever you'd buy for me.  
**Yume:** Why are you the one thanking me? That's weird, isn't it? I mean, I'm the one who should be thankful.  
**Maki:** No, let me say it too. Thank you for being here to visit the shrine with us, Yume.  
**Yume:** Why are you thanking me now, Maki-onee-san!? This is weird, right? Yomi-onee-san!  
**Yomi:** ...I'm the only one who hasn't said anything. Thank you all. Shidou-san, Konohana-san, Tsubakuro-san.  
**Yume:** Not you too, Yomi-onee-san!?  
**Suzuka:** Fufu. You want to go flower viewing again this year as well, don't you, Yume?  
**Yume:** Nn, I want to go, but... No sweet sake this time, okay?  
**Maki:** ...Fireworks, maybe at the summer festival, would be nice too, wouldn't it? I'd rather see them together than alone this time.  
**Yume:** Fireworks!? I really wanna see that!  
**Yomi:** Isn't there anything you want to do this year, Tsubakuro-san?  
**Yume:** What I want to do...? Oh yeah! Seeing the autumn leaves!  
**Yomi:** Understood. We can all go together.  
**Yume:** And, what else~. I still have to beat Yukari-sama, so a whole bunch of people can see how great I am!  
**Yomi:** There's a lot you want to do, isn't there. Shouldn't you have wished to the gods about it then?  
**Yume:** Ehh~? I don't have to do that~. Cause... The four of us can make it all happen together!

## [VRS Equipment - Yume: Start]: Nothing to It but to Do It!
**Maki:** [mumble mumble mumble]...   
**Yume:** Geez, Maki-onee-san, how long're you going to keep reading the instructions for?   
**Maki:** Just give me a bit more time, Yume. I want to thoroughly drill myself on all the game commands, just in case a bug occurs in the game world.  
**Tsugumi:** Shidou-san, I understand why you might feel unsure of using cutting edge technology, but I can assure you, this VR game Kitora-san and I helped to develop is perfectly safe. You have nothing to worry about.  
**Yume:** That's right-, they say it's popular with other toji onee-sans too, so it's fine.  
**Maki:** Still, since they say it's an action shooting game, there's no way to avoid battling enemies, is there? If worse comes to worst, and I end up losing with a weapon I'm not used to...  
**Yume:** Come on-, you take everything way too seriously, Maki-onee-san-.  
**Tsugumi:** I have to agree. There is a battle stage in this VR game, but exploring the city is the main objective, so that won't be an issue.  
**Yume:** See, this onee-san's saying the same thing. Let's get started already-.  
**Maki:** Just hang on! Only another 20 pages and I'll have finished the manual...  
**Yume:** With these things, it's easy to just learn while playing-. Isn't it, Onee-san?  
**Tsugumi:** I believe that everyone learns in different ways. Tsubakuro-san, if you're ever in trouble, please ask Shidou-san for the commands.  
**Yume:** Okaaay! Maki-onee-san, as soon as you're ready, we're going in!  
**Yume:** Wow-! Look, look! The city's all sparkly and pretty-. Ah, there's something up on the roof of that building! Let's go check it out!  
**Maki:** Hey, Yume! Wait for me! You can't run off on your own!  
**Yume:** Ahaha! This is funnn! I know! Let's climb up to the top of that really high building! Hurry up, Maki-onee-san-!  
**Maki:** Hold on, I'll be right there! ...You know, while we're here, this world is incredible. We can jump ten times higher than usual. We got to the top of a high rise building in no time.  
**Yume:** Ahh! There's a helicopter parked on the roof of the next building over! Think I can jump to there?  
**Maki:** Oi, hold it, Yume! Even here, a jump that far is going to be...  
**Maki:** Err... What was the long distance jump command...  
**Yume:** I don't believe it-! Maki-onee-san, you even brought the instruction manual in here?  
**Maki:** There's times when we'll need to have it handy. Just hold on, Yume, I'm checking over the commands now...  
**Yume:** Don't worry, it's easy peasy!  Here I gooo-! Juuump!  
**Maki:** Ahh-- Yume!  
**Yume:** See, look! I jumped to this roof just fine-! You come too, Maki-onee-san-.  
**Maki:** Whoa! What's with the strength of this wind!? It'll be tough reaching there through this.  
**Maki:** I'll go after it dies down. Oiii, Yume, just to be sure, find somewhere safe to get out of the wind.  
**Yume:** I'll be fine-. See, if I go all the way into the corner of the roof, I can get a really pretty view of the city at night down bel...  
**Yume:** Wah----!  
**Maki:** Yume!  
**Yume:** No way! I'm falling!?  
**Yume:** Uhh, when this happens, what was I supposed to do? What do I do, Maki-onee-san!? I'm gonna fall all the way down!  

## [VRS Equipment - Yume: End]: Seriousness Pays Off
**Maki:** Yume! Are you okay!? Yume-!!  
**Yume:** Wahhh, what should I do! I'm falling all the way down---!  
**Yume:** Maki-onee-chan, save me-!  
**Maki:** Yume! Are you okay? Grab onto my hand!   
**Yume:** Maki-onee-san!  
**Maki:** Alright, I've got you. I'll take us down slowly, so don't leave my arms.  
**Yume:** Okay, thanks... Wait, what! Maki-onee-san, you're flying!? How? How-?  
**Maki:** In this game world, there's a command to fly through the air.  
**Yume:** Ehhh!? Nobody told me that-!  
**Maki:** It was written in the instruction manual. You should have read it.  
**Yume:** Boo-. Instead of reading that big book, it seemed like it'd be faster learning by trying it yourself-.  
**Maki:** Sure, even if you memorize the manual, if you can't handle the controls when the time comes, there wasn't much point.  
**Yume:** Still, it's because you took reading it so seriously that you saved me. Thanks.  
**Maki:** Here, Yume. We've landed safely.  
**Yume:** Ahh~, thank goodness!   
**Yume:** Hey hey, teach me how to fly in the sky too!  
**Maki:** Of course; it'd be dangerous if this happened again, after all. Watch me closely. You do this...  
**Yume:** Okay, okay, like this?  
**Yume:** Whoa-, that's crazy! I'm flying too!  
**Maki:** You're a natural, Yume. Just after seeing that complicated command one time, you already memorized it.  
**Yume:** Hey hey, since I can fly now and all, well, I'm going to fly up to the top of the highest building!  
**Maki:** It does seem pretty high up there. Though, while we're in this world, we might as well enjoy it.  
**Yume:** Wow-, it's super high up here on the roof! You can see all the night lights in the city-.  
**Maki:** Oi, Yume! If you walk on the edge of the building, you're going to fall like before!  
**Yume:** I'm fine, I'm fine! Cause I can fly now! See, look!  
**Yume:** Wawawa, I'm falling-!  
**Maki:** Yume! Did you lose your footing again!?  
**Yume:** Just kidding! I'm fine; I remember how to fly, okay.  
**Maki:** Hey, Yume! Don't tease me like that...  
**Yume:** Still, it's really amazing that you can do this here too! I'm glad I came here with someone who'd read the whole manual!

## [Hostess - Yume: Start]: Yume's Work Experience!
**Maki:** ......  
**Maki:** ...Sigh.  
**Suzuka:** ...Why not relax some?  
**Suzuka:** It won't help anything to walk around in circles like you've been doing.  
**Suzuka:** Knowing you, you must be worried about Yume, aren't you?  
**Maki:** When I think about if Yume's doing her workplace experience trip right... I just can't settle down.  
**Suzuka:** The ryokan Yume left for has been hosting students of the Five Traditions for their workplace experience for years.  
**Suzuka:** We only asked if they would kindly take in Yume, despite not being part of the Five Traditions, and Yomi-san even went along with her.  
**Suzuka:** Nothing of concern is going to happen.  
**Maki:** Well, you're right... Yeah. I'll just focus on my own work.  
**Yomi:** Tsubakuro-san, the last aradama is headed your way. Please take care of it.  
**Aradama:** ...GGGGG!  
**Yume:** Leave it to me-! HAAAAAAAAH!  
**Yume:** Annnd done!  
**Yume:** We were just about to get changed and help do hostess work, so don't get in our way anymore-.  
**Yomi:** Good job. I'll contact the noro recovery team, so it's alright for you to return to the ryokan first, Tsubakuro-san.  
**Yume:** Nnn-. I'll wait here too. I'd rather be with you, Onee-san.  
**Yomi:** Alright then.  
**Yomi:** You know, I was slightly surprised to see how proactive you were about your workplace experience.  
**Yume:** You were? I've never really done this kind of thing before, so it feels sort of fresh!  
**Yomi:** ......  
**Yomi:** You don't often get a chance to work as a hostess, do you. This is my first time too, so it does feel fresh.  
**Yume:** See~!  
**Yomi:** There are no longer any signs of aradama in the area of the ryokan. Please rest assured.  
**Ryokan Proprietress:** Thank you very much. It's such a help, having you two here.  
**Ryokan Proprietress:** Because of you, our guests could go about within the ryokan without starting a panic.  
**Yume:** No matter how many times aradama like that come along, I'll beat them right away, so you don't have to worry about it-.  
**Ryokan Proprietress:** Fufu. Though, we would be worried, if aradama appeared that many times in the short time you're here.  
**Yume:** Ah! I guess you're right.  
**Yume:** Oh yeah. After we put on our hostess clothes, we were going to help out, but, what should we do?  
**Ryokan Proprietress:** The work I'll have you do is nothing more than simple cleaning of the rooms, and a check over their furnishings.  
**Ryokan Proprietress:** We have people hired to take care of the full cleaning, but this is one last check before the guests come through. Whoever is in charge will show you how it's done, so please work along with them.  
**Yume:** Okaaay~.  

## [Hostess - Yume: End]: For the Special Menu!
**Yume:** I thought meeting guests and showing them their rooms felt like what a real hostess would do, but I didn't think, after we did it a couple times, they'd ask us to go pick vegetables next.  
**Yomi:** They seem to have a special menu of vegetables grown here on the mountain they own that's served to guests who request it.  
**Yume:** You think this is enough we've got-?  
**Yomi:** It might be. It wouldn't be good if we gathered too many at once, so why don't we check with the ryokan for now.  
**Yume:** Then, I'll go ask!  
**Yume:** --Though, now that I'm looking closer... Onee-san. Were you picking only mushrooms? ...Why? Do you like them?  
**Yomi:** There's no special reason. I just happened to. Though, these mushrooms have grown well.  
**Yomi:** You could make a good soup stock from these shiitake, and their thickness would make them good for use in cooking.  
**Yume:** I don't like them all that much, but, if the guests like it, it's fine.  
**Yomi:** That would be best, wouldn't it.  
**Maki:** You look like you're working hard for the ryokan, Yume.  
**Yume:** Maki-onee-san, Suzuka-onee-san!? Why're you here!?  
**Suzuka:** A certain someone was worried to death over you, so we came to see you in the end.  
**Maki:** Suzuka... You promised you wouldn't say anything.  
**Suzuka:** Oh, did I?  
**Yume:** You're treating me like a kid again-. You didn't have to worry about me or anything. See, look. I'm doing my job juuust fine.  
**Maki:** Yeah, I can tell. Those all look tasty.  
**Suzuka:** I'll be looking forward to enjoying what you've picked for dinner.  
**Yume:** You're having these for dinner!?  
**Suzuka:** We are. We made a reservation just now.  
**Suzuka:** I asked for all four of us, you and Yomi-san included, to sit for dinner together. So stick to your work until then.  
**Yume:** Okay! Then, I'm going to get going!  
The next day--

  
**Yume:** I wasn't used to doing any of that stuff, but that was pretty fun yesterday.  
**Yume:** It seems like it'd be tough working as a hostess every day. There's a lot of rooms you have to clean and all.  
**Yomi:** That was a fairly established ryokan.  
**Yume:** Since we were all there, it would've been nice if all four of us could have slept over there together too.  
**Yume:** But, we were only there for that workplace experience thing, so I get that it would've been hard setting up-.  
**Maki:** On top of that, we have work we can't afford to leave undone.  
**Suzuka:** Yesterday was truly a spur of the moment arrangement, so we couldn't make preparations. Though, it would be nice if the four of us could do something like that again someday.  
**Yume:** Someday for sure!

## [Misogi - Yume: Start]: Why Won't You Let Me!
**Yume:** Maki-onee-san.  
**Maki:** Nn? Oh, it's you, Yume.  
**Maki:** Sorry, but I don't have a lot of time right now. If this'll take long, can we save it for later?  
**Yume:** You always seem like you're busy, Maki-onee-san. What's going on today?  
**Maki:** We got a report about an aradama, but it seems like a pretty large scale one. There's nobody available who can handle it.  
**Yume:** A large scale aradama!!  
**Yume:** Then, isn't it okay if I go?  
**Maki:** You're here on standby, Yume.  
**Maki:** You don't need to do anything more than the work we give you.  
**Maki:** I have to get going.  
**Yume:** ...She just left me. If there's a large scale aradama, they could've just told me.  
**Yume:** Ahhh, this is so boring-. I could do it fine all by myself; I don't even need a unit or anything.  
**Yume:** ...When I joined the elite guard, I thought I'd get to sortie a whole lot more and fight a bunch of tough aradama... But all I'm ever doing is waiting at home!  
**Yume:** I can't show how off how strong I am at all like this...  
**Yume:** ...I got it!  
**Yume:** If I prove to them I'm strong, I bet they'll let me go on more sorties.  
**Yomi:** You want to fight a match against me?  
**Yume:** Yeah. Cause they aren't letting me go suppress any aradama at all.  
**Yume:** So, if I beat all the onee-sans in the elite guard, you'll have to think I'm really strong.  
**Yomi:** ...  
**Yomi:** I don't feel there's any need for us to fight... The outcome is obvious.  
**Yume:** But, you won't know that till we try it!  
**Yomi:** ...Won't I?  
**Yume:** Anyway... Here I come!  
**Yomi:** ...gh.  
**Yume:** H-Huh? Are you done already?  
**Yomi:** ...The outcome was obvious.  
**Yume:** Wait, that's what you meant!?  
**Yomi:** This is as far as my skills with a sword go.  
**Yume:** I can't show how strong I am with that... Aghh, geez, I'll go to the next one! Suzuka-onee-san!  
**Yume:** YAAAH!!  
**Suzuka:** You're good, Yume!  
**Yume:** You too, Suzuka-onee-san! But... if that's all you've got, this'll be over in no time!  
**Suzuka:** I thought that-- You would come like that!  
**Yume:** Huh!?  
**Yume/Suzuka:** --!!  
**Suzuka:** And I thought I had gotten you with that counter... So you can even react to that.  
**Yume:** That got me by surprise! That was a little bit close there!  
**Suzuka:** ...Those reflexes of yours are frightening.  
**Yume:** This is getting fun, right, Suzuka-onee-san? Let's do it some more!  
**Suzuka:** ...This is my loss. You are strong, Yume.  
**Yume:** Yeah, I'm strong, right? So that's why, you can send me on a bunch more suppression missions, okay?  
**Suzuka:** ...R-Right, I'll keep that in mind.  
**Yume:** All that's left is Maki-onee-san... and Yukari-sama. If I beat Yukari-sama, everybody'll know I'm strong.  

## [Misogi - Yume: End]: I'll Get Even Stronger!
**Maki:** I'm back.  
**Yume:** I was waiting for you, Maki-onee-san.  
**Maki:** Yume...? Oh right, before I left to suppress that aradama, you were saying something.  
**Yume:** ...Fight a match against me, Maki-onee-san.  
**Maki:** A match... As the first seat, that's something I can't afford to lose.  
**Yume:** Well I'm not gonna lose either.  
**Yume:** Cause I'll... I'm going to show tons of people just how strong I am.  
**Yume:** ...Maki-onee-san hits so hard-. My hands are all tingly.  
**Maki:** What's the matter, Yume! If you're not going to come attack me, I'll end things like this!  
**Yume:** I think you're getting ahead of yourself!  
**Maki:** Too soft!  
**Yume:** What part!  
**Maki:** Tch!  
**Yume:** You sure are strong, Maki-onee-san! But, I'm even stronger!  
**Maki:** That's something... you only get to say after you win!  
**Yume:** Yeah... I'll win! I'm... stronger than you, Maki-onee-san!  
**Yume:** Hooray-! I beat Maki-onee-san!  
**Maki:** Damnit... Am I supposed to feel frustrated that I lost, or proud my kouhai's grown so promising... These are some mixed up feelings.  
**Yume:** So now you know I'm strong, right? And, starting tomorrow, you'll put me on lots of sorties?  
**Maki:** Sorties? Wait, that doesn't...  
**Yume:** ...No good yet, huh. So I've gotta beat Yukari-sama after all...  
**Maki:** H-Hey, Yume? That's not what I meant...  
**Yume:** I'm gonna go over there real quick, Maki-onee-san.  
**Yume:** Yukari-sama~.  
**Yukari:** Yume? What do you need?  
**Yume:** Have a fight with me.  
**Yukari:** I don't have time to entertain you now. Though... If we can do it here, I'll keep you company.  
**Yukari:** Come whenever you're ready.  
**Yume:** Whenever I'm ready... When should I...  
**Yume:** Go!  
**Yukari:** ...  
**Yume:** You dodged that!?  
**Yume:** ...Ahah! This time, I'll do something even more ama-- zing!  
**Yukari:** To make me draw my okatana...... That is impressive.  
**Yume:** If we didn't get this far, we'd both be bored, right, Yukari-sama?  
**Yume:** So then, I'll do even more-!  
**Yume:** That's what I want, Yukari-sama-!  
**Yukari:** ...It's about time now. Sorry, Yume.  
**Yume:** Uwah!?  
**Yukari:** That's all for today.  
**Yume:** J-Just one more time! If I don't beat you, they won't let me go on any sorties!  
**Yukari:** Where did you get that idea? The reason you go on so few sorties is because Shidou and Konohana are concerned about your body.  
**Yume:** Huh...? ...But, they never told me about that.  
**Yume:** And anyway, Maki-onee-san and Suzuka-onee-san worry way too much!  
**Yukari:** You shouldn't say that.  
**Yume:** But still...  
**Yukari:** ...Yume. You put up a fine attack. I'll play with you again, so stay diligent.  
**Yume:** Okay!  
**Yume:** (Ahh, that was so fun! I'll get even stronger next time, and then I'll even beat Yukari-sama!)  
**Yume:** ...I'm really glad I joined the elite guard!

## [1,001 Nights - Yume: Start]: A Request
**Maki:** Excuse us, Yukari-sama.  
**Yukari:** You're here. I have a request for you from the Sword Administration Bureau.  
**Suzuka:** A request?  
**Yume:** Is it aradama!? Yukari-sama, did a really tough aradama show up!?  
**Yukari:** ...That's not it. This request comes from the public relations department.  
**Yume:** Really-? What a letdown-.  
**Yomi:** What sort of request is it?  
**Yukari:** You've been requested to participate in an indoor pool's event.  
**Yume:** But there's no point in us going, is there?  
**Yukari:** Don't say that, Yume.  
**Suzuka:** Listen to Yukari-sama, Yume. This too is fine work for the elite guard.  
**Yume:** Then you onee-sans can go do it on your own.  
**Maki:** Yume! Don't act so spoiled.  
**Yukari:** Then, Yume. After you finish this request, I'll be your opponent. It's been a while.  
**Yume:** You mean it!? Then, I guess I have to go.  
**Yume:** But, you have to promise, Yukari-sama! You can't go saying you take it back after this!  
**Yukari:** Good. I promise.  
**Yomi:** Is that alright?  
**Yukari:** It's not too much to ask. And...  
**Yume:** Yesss-! I finally get to fight against Yukari-sama-!  
**Yukari:** If she's that happy about it.  
**Yomi:** ...I see.  
**Maki:** Yukari-sama, can you share with me the details of the event? I'll have to get notes ready in advance for the speech.  
**Suzuka:** Wait, Maki-san. I'll take care of that.  
**Maki:** Thanks, Suzuka. I'm leaving it to you.  
**Suzuka:** Of course; you can rely on me.  
**Yukari:** Though, about your assignment this time... You won't be part of a ceremony.  
**Yukari:** You will be giving a dance performance as part of the pool's Arabian event.  
**Yume:** Eh...!?  
**Yume:** Instead of listening to some boring speeches at a ceremony, we're dancing?  

## [1,001 Nights - Yume: End]: A Promise for Next Time 
--The day of the event.

  
**Maki:** We have to wear these!?  
**Yume:** You don't like it, Maki-onee-san? They're so cute though.  
**Maki:** Look how much stomach it shows... I can't wear something that cute!  
**Suzuka:** Yes... It's embarrassing for me as well.   
**Yume:** Why don't you want to wear it that bad though?  
**Yume:** It doesn't really feel like something you'd say, Maki-onee-san. You'd be more like, "All clothes are the same-!"  
**Maki:** ...I don't think all clothes are the same.  
**Maki:** And I'm just... a little self-conscious about my stomach.  
**Yume:** You mean cause it'll be cold?  
**Maki:** That's not it.  
**Maki:** ...Isn't my stomach way too toned compared to everybody?  
**Suzuka:** My, were you really worried about that?  
**Yume:** You're a real workout monster, Maki-onee-san-.  
**Yomi:** We're out of time, everyone. Please hurry and change.  
**Yume:** Okaaay.  
**Suzuka:** So she says. Time to find your resolve, Maki-san...  
**Maki:** But... Gh, I guess this is a mission too!  
**Yume:** Hmhmhmm~! And, turn here!  
**Yume:** Ahaha! I didn't think dancing would be this fun!  
**Maki:** You were the one who didn't want to do this the most at first, Yume, and now you're having the most fun with it.  
**Suzuka:** Isn't it charming to see her act her age?  
**Maki:** ...That's true.  
**Yume:** Geez! Maki-onee-san, you're messing up the rhythm.  
**Maki:** Huh!?  
**Yomi:** ...  
**Yume:** Yomi-onee-san, you've gotta smile more!  
**Yomi:** ...Was I not smiling?  
**Yume:** You haven't smiled for a second-!  
**Suzuka:** Fufu, an event like this isn't so bad, is it, Yume.  
**Yume:** Yeah! I want us all to do this again!  
<div class="videoWrapper"><iframe width="640" height="480" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0OSG6EeTdH8"></iframe></div>  

## [Mahou Shoujo - Yume: Start]: Let's Go Together!
**Yume:** Where'd she go... Ah, there you are! Fate-chan!  
**Fate:** Yume-san?  
**Yume:** Huh? What're you doing with Maki-onee-san?  
**Maki:** I was just hearing from her about the incident going on. What did you need, Yume?  
**Yume:** Aradama showed up, so I came to get her. Let's go together, Fate-chan.  
**Fate:** Aradama...? But...  
**Maki:** It's fine with me. Though, when you get back, I might have to talk with you again...  
**Fate:** ...Thank you, Maki-san.  
**Fate:** If helping out could reduce the damage they cause by even a little, I'll go along with you.  
**Yume:** Neat! I'll be sure to show you a whole bunch of how strong I am!  
**Fate:** Eh? But I know that you're strong, Yume-san.  
**Yume:** I can't wait! Let's get there fast, Fate-chan!  
**Tsugumi:** They've arrived at last... Oh? Why is Harlaown-san here?  
**Fate:** I accepted Yume-san's invitation to help.  
**Nanoha:** Ah, it's Fate-chan.  
**Fate:** Wait, Nanoha?  
**Tsugumi:** I asked Takamachi-san to assist me. We were working together just before this.  
**Nanoha:** Yomi-san was actually with us too, but she had to go someplace else.  
**Fate:** Is that how it happened. Let's do what we can, Nanoha.  
**Nanoha:** Sure, Fate-chan!  
**Yume:** So anyway, why're you just standing around doing nothing here?  
**Tsugumi:** We were waiting for you, Tsubakuro-san.  
**Yume:** Oh, you were? Then, you can go back and leave the rest to me, Onee-san.  
**Tsugumi:** I probably could-.  
**Tsugumi:** We won't go back, but I'll count on you to do your best.  
**Yume:** Sure!   
**Fate:** Umm... Is this going to be okay, Tsugumi-san?  
**Tsugumi:** Is what okay?  
**Fate:** The aradama... Isn't it going to be hard when they show up? I don't get that feeling from Yume-san...  
**Tsugumi:** Tsubakuro-san is plenty strong though-.  
**Tsugumi:** Since she doesn't struggle fighting aradama, there's not much sense of danger, so perhaps a part of her merely thinks of it as an extended game.  
**Fate:** Then, why is it that Yume-san became a toji?  
**Tsugumi:** Only Tsubakuro-san knows the answer to that.  
**Tsugumi:**  Though... Everything will be fine.  
**Fate:** Eh?  
**Tsugumi:** Tsubakuro-san is a toji too. Please have faith in her.  
**Fate:** ...Okay.  

## [Mahou Shoujo - Yume: End]: It's Not Like That!?
**Aradama:** GUOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!  
**Yume:** YAAH!  
**Aradama:** Oooo...  
**Yume:** Geez, there's nothing but weak aradama here!  
**Yume:** How am I supposed to show Fate-chan how strong I am like this!  
**Fate:** You don't need to go that far, Yume-san.  
**Fate:** I think it's incredible how you can defeat aradama the moment we find them.  
**Yume:** That's not really that incredible or anything.  
**Fate:** ...  
**Fate:** Why did you become a toji, Yume-san?  
**Yume:** Ehh? To show people what makes me so strong.  
**Fate:** What makes you strong?  
**Yume:** Yeah. That's why, I thought I'd get to show you too, Fate-chan, but...  
**Yume:** Wait, I know!  
**Fate:** Yume-san?  
**Yume:** Since we have the chance, let's have some fun while we do this... Fate-chan!  
**Fate:** --!?  
**Yume:** Aha! Fighting with you really is fun, Fate-chan!  
**Fate:** We're in the middle of a mission right now!  
**Yume:** Yeah! So, while we do the mission, let's fight, Fate-chan!  
**Fate:** Kh... Stop this, Yume-san!  
**Yume:** I'm not gonna!  
**Aradama:** BGYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!  
**Yume:** You're in the way!  
**Fate:** (Yume-san... She actually is defeating aradama while fighting me.)  
**Fate:** (Showing others what makes her strong... Is that really so important to Yume-san?)  
**Yume:** C'mon, c'mon! What's wrong, Fate-chan!  
**Fate:** --! YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!  
**Aradama:** ooooo...  
**Fate:** I'll be your opponent, but I'll only attack the aradama...  
**Fate:** Will that be alright?  
**Yume:** ...Aha! It's fine with me!  
**Tsugumi:** Okay, that's enough-.  
**Yume:** Ehhh!? What're you and Nanoha-chan doing here, Onee-san?  
**Tsugumi:** We heard something troubling going on, so we hurried over.  
**Nanoha:** Fate-chan, if you're going to fight with Yume-san, I think you should do it after the mission's over...  
**Fate:** Y-You've got it all wrong, Nanoha! I was making sure to do the mission!?  
**Yume:** Geez, and it was just getting fun too. Let's pick up from here when we get back, Fate-chan.  
**Nanoha:** Fate-chan can get pretty intense when it comes to combat training...  
**Fate:** I told you, it's not like that!!  

<div class="videoWrapper"><iframe width="640" height="480" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0SoaKrXIWPw"></iframe></div>  

## [Dress '21 - Yume: Start]: You Excited? It's the Spring Flower Party!
**Yume:** Hey, hey, Yomi-onee-san! All the people coming to the party today are toji, aren't they?  
**Yomi:** Not exactly all of them, but everyone from the Five Traditions was invited, so the majority should be toji.  
**Yume:** That's a lot though! So, who do you think's the strongest of them all?  
**Yume:** I can't really tell, so I think I'll just challenge whoever I feel like!  
**Suzuka:** Yume, we're all here today to appreciate the flowers, not to fight amongst each other.  
**Maki:** That's right. And besides, our job here is to act as guards.  
**Maki:** We're keeping this up until late tonight, so you're going to wear yourself out if you're getting too excited first thing.  
**Yume:** We're doing this until night? Didn't they say we were just guarding during the day?  
**Maki:** Oh yeah; you're only in charge of the day part, aren't you.  
**Yume:** The day part? So that means the party's still going on at night too?  
**Yomi:** Akane-sama proposed that we split the party into two parts, for the toji who couldn't arrive during the day due to their missions.  
**Yume:** She did? So wait, then, I can just be a normal guest for the night part, right?  
**Maki:** Sure; but don't get too carried away with it.  
**Yume:** Nice-!  
**Yume:** Ah-- There's some onee-sans over there! Heyyy!  
**Kanami:** Oh; Yume-chan! Come and look! They decorated this cake with flowers all over; isn't it cute?  
**Yume:** Wow; it really is! --Wait, forget that, come out to the courtyard with me, Onee-san!  
**Kanami:** Huh? The courtyard? Did you want to look at the flowers together?  
**Yume:** Not that-! There's a whole bunch of toji coming here today, so we're going to have a big match to see who's the strongest!  
**Kanami:** That sounds cool! You'll come too, right, Hiyori-chan?  
**Hiyori:** Hmm... If you say so, then I guess I have to.  
**Mihono:** That'll be fun! Let me in too-!  
**Yume:** Yayyy, more and more people are coming! I can fight anybody I want! So, who should I beat first-?  
**Maki:** Hey, Yume! The moment I take my eyes off you, you're already starting something.  
**Yomi:** Our team's duty is to act as security for the venue today.  
**Suzuka:** You're meant to mingle naturally amongst the partygoers while keeping an eye on things...  
**Yume:** Boo... But for me though, fighting with everybody's the most natural thing to do.  
**Yomi:** You might be right, but you are on duty, at least during the day. Please bear with it.  
**Yume:** Fiiine...  
**Yume:** Ahh, I'm so bored. They said just to enjoy the party normally, so I ate the food, and talked, and...  
**Yume:** Yawwwn. Now I'm feeling tired cause I'm full.  
**Yume:** Zzzzzzzzzzzz......  
**Yume:** Yawwwn... Huh? It's dark out...?  
**Yume:** It's sorta quiet too... Wait!? There was all those guests and now I don't see anybody!  
**Yume:** Does that mean; did I sleep through the whole party!?  

## [Dress '21 - Yume: End]: A Private Time After the Party?
**Yume:** Wahhh! I don't believe it! The party's seriously over!  
**Yomi:** Oh, you're awake now, Tsubakuro-san.  
**Yume:** Yeah, I'm awake now-! So why didn't you wake me up!?  
**Maki:** You just looked so peaceful sleeping, we'd feel bad waking you up.  
**Suzuka:** The way you were surrounded by flowers, you were as adorable as Sleeping Beauty.  
**Suzuka:** See, I took a photo; have a look.  
**Yume:** Wow, I really do-! --Wait!! That's not the point!  
**Yume:** Didn't you say how, after I was done guarding during the day, I could do what I wanted at night?  
**Yume:** Did all the toji onee-sans really leave already?  
**Maki:** Yeah. They all said they'd be busy with missions and training again first thing tomorrow morning.  
**Yume:** Boo! I was supposed to have a bunch of fights with all the different toji onee-sans!  
**Yume:** What was even the point of having the party now!?  
**Yomi:** To appreciate the flowers...  
**Maki:** Hey, it's alright; if you want to spar with somebody, I'll do it with you tomorrow.  
**Yume:** You're no good, Maki-onee-san! I wanted to fight with a whole lot more people.  
**Suzuka:** Sigh... I suppose we should have woken you up regardless.  
**Maki:** There's not much we can do now though. Right, Yomi?  
**Maki:** Hm...? Where'd Yomi go? Did she go back to her room already?  
**Suzuka:** We should return as well. I'll have my father send more flowers next year, so we can look forward to having the party again.  
**Yume:** Now they're all gone... Aww, and I thought this was going to be a lot of fun with everybody...  
**Yume:** Sigh... It's just boring...  
**Yomi:** Tsubakuro-san, you're still here. Good.  
**Yume:** Yomi-onee-san? Didn't you go back to your room?  
**Yomi:** I thought about it, but I saw that the bar was still open.  
**Yomi:** If you'd like, will you have a drink with me?  
**Yume:** Whoa! This cocktail's so pretty! But, is it really okay for somebody young to drink this?  
**Yomi:** I had them make special non-alcoholic ones.  
**Yume:** Neat! Then I'll have some!  
**Yume:** What's with this; it's super yummy! They didn't have this at the party, did they?  
**Yomi:** They didn't. Since the orders had slowed down, it seems that they made extra flavorful ones for us.  
**Yume:** So this special cocktail's just for you and me? Thanks, Yomi-onee-san!  
**Yomi:** I'm glad to see you're feeling better now.  
**Yume:** Next year, I want to invite even more toji, and then we can have a really exciting party!  
**Yume:** And then, everybody can have this cocktail there too! Doesn't that sound good?  
**Yomi:** It's a little early to be thinking about next year. But, I think that would be nice.  

## [Another - Yume: Start]: My All Eroding Plan
**Kanami:** HAAH!  
**Yume:** I can see right through that, Chidori-onee-san!  
**Hiyori:** Gh, she even saw that attack coming...?  
**Yume:** Onee-sans, why're you stopping me? My all erosion plan's going to make everybody happy, okay?  
**Yume:** Nobody'll have to go through anything bad anymore.  
**Yume:** Everybody can keep their promises for tomorrow...  
**Yume:** The fun times'll keep going... forever and ever and ever!  
**Yume:** What'd you stay behind for?  
**Yume:** Chidori-onee-san.  
**Kanami:** I don't really get it either.  
**Kanami:** But... When I took your sword, I felt like, I had to be the one to be here.  
**Yume:** ...Thanks, Onee-san. I want you to remember me, okay... [Cough! Cough!]  
**Kanami:** Tsubakuro-san!?  
**Yume:** Don't come over! This is, my... SEEEEEEEIII!  
**Yume:** This is... Oh yeah. I was fighting with Chidori-onee-san, and... I died.  
**Yume:** But... I guess that's fine.  
**Yume:** Chidori-onee-san'll remember... that I'm strong. That I was strong.  
**???:** Are you satisfied with that?  
**Yume:** Who's there?  
**Tagitsu:** You may call me Tagitsuhime.  
**Yume:** Tagitsuhime? Wasn't that the great aradama Yukari-sama beat? Wait... then why're you here?  
**Tagitsu:** No need to mind something so trifling. That's not what matters now, Tsubakuro Yume. Do you not want to live
 longer?  
**Yume:** ...I don't really care. I don't think I need to live that much.  
**Yume:** Because... Chidori-onee-san's gonna remember me.  
**Tagitsu:** And after Etou Kanami has died?  
**Yume:** ...Huh?  
**Tagitsu:** If Etou Kanami were to die, no one will remain to remember your strength.  
**Tagitsu:** Would you be satisfied?  
**Yume:** That'd...  
**Tagitsu:** Accept me into yourself, Tsubakuro Yume.  
**Tagitsu:** I could truly grant your wishes. Merge aradama and humanity, evolving this immature species to a higher 
existence.  
**Yume:** Evolve...?  
**Tagitsu:** A plan to erode it all.  
**Tagitsu:** Humanity will live on for eternity. None who remember you will ever die.  
**Yume:** ...I can keep having fun forever...  
**Tagitsu:** That's right. What will you choose, Tsubakuro Yume.  
**Yume:** I...  
**Maki:** Yume!? You're really alive...  
**Suzuka:** Maki-san.  
**Maki:** R-Right... Yume-sama, congratulations on your recovery.  
**Yume:** Wait, why "Yume-sama"?  
**Suzuka:** That was Yukari-sama's final request, as she was undergoing medical treatment. To treat and serve Yume-sama 
as if you were her.  
**Yume:** Yukari-sama, she...  
**Yomi:** Yes. Tsubakuro-sama, if you would come this way.  
**Yume:** Yomi-onee-san...  
**Yume:** (I can't talk to them like we used to... And Yukari-sama's gone too...)  
**Tagitsu:** (Carry through the all erosion plan. Do that, and everything will be just to your wishes.)  
**Yume:** (...Yeah. If I do the all erosion plan, everything'll go back to normal. I just have to do the all erosion 
plan...)  

## [Another - Yume: End]: Once More with Those Dear
**Yomi:** Tsubakuro-sama. Akane-sama has escaped her imprisonment, with Mokusa's assistance.  
**Yume:** Just send Maki-onee-san and Suzuka-onee-san. Those two should be able to handle it. Right, Yomi-onee-san?  
**Yomi:** They will.  
**Maki:** When I heard Mokusa broke Akane-sama out, I never thought it'd be you two! Etou, Juujou!  
**Suzuka:** If you give up Akane-sama in peace, we can settle this without having to do anything unsavory.  
**Hiyori:** We refuse. Do you really think we'd going along with that... when we know we'd just get taken out like 
Origami Yukari?  
**Maki:** ...Taken out? What are you talking about?  
**Suzuka:** We'd never... That's ridiculous...  
**Hiyori:** It's the truth. Origami Yukari got abandoned by Tagitsuhime and was about to be killed. That's when... 
Kanami and I saved her.  
**Maki:** Tagitsuhime... and Yukari-sama...?  
**Kanami:** Tagitsuhime's possessing Tsubakuro-san right now. You can't keep doing what she says!  
**Maki:** Yume's... possessed by Tagitsuhime... No wonder... I've been feeling like Yume was acting like Yukari-sama 
used to.  
**Suzuka:** That is true... If you're saying it's because of Tagitsuhime, I could accept that...  
**Akane:** Maki-san, Suzuka-san. Please hear us out. Work together with us.  
**Maki:** ...That I can't do.  
**Kanami:** But why not!?  
**Suzuka:** Regardless of everything... Yume is still dear to us...  
**Suzuka:** Even if she were being manipulated by Tagitsuhime... We couldn't turn our okatana on her.  
**Akane:** ...Could you at least tell this to Tsubakuro-san? That Kanami-san and Juujou-san wish to become myouga toji.  
**Maki:** That's an excuse to meet with Yume...?  
**Akane:** That's right. It would be Yume-san's decision to make.  
**Maki:** If that's all... But...  
**Suzuka:** Maki-san... I'll support whatever you decide on.  
**Maki:** ...Thanks, Suzuka.  
**Maki:** We're just letting her know. After that... We'll follow what Yume decides.  
**Akane:** That's more than enough.  
**Akane:** ...We're depending on you for the rest, Kanami-san, Hiyori-san.  
**Kanami:** Sure, you can leave it to us.  
**Hiyori:** Right. Kanami and I will absolutely destroy Tagitsuhime.  
**Yume:** Chidori-onee-san said she wants to be a myouga toji!? Yeah, I'll see her right away!  
**Yume:** Now she can keep on remembering me! We'll keep having fun forever and ever!  
**Tagitsu:** (...It's possible this is a trap.)  
**Yume:** Yeah, I know that. But, does it matter? If it is, I'll just beat her and make her a myouga toji anyway.  
**Yume:** We can keep it going... The fun'll keep going forever and ever and ever!  
**Kanami:** There's nothing fun about that! Back then... even that was more fun!  
**Yume:** !?  
**Kanami:** Toji who go through myouga, their minds get put under your control, right?  
**Kanami:** Back then, when you told me to remember you, was that how you meant it!?  
**Yume:** ...  
**Hiyori:** Those two in the elite guard, they were worried about you. But they said, no matter what you did, they'd 
never betray you... That they could never turn their okatana on you.  
**Hiyori:** Even still... are you seriously okay with that! You're going to brainwash the elite guard... them too!?  
**Yume:** ...  
**Kanami:** I remember it all, Tsubakuro-san! How strong you are!  
**Kanami:** Not the strength Tagitsuhime gave you! The real Tsubakuro-san... she's so much stronger than this!  
**Yume:** But... If I don't, the people who remember me, they'll be gone eventually.  
**Tagitsu:** (Yes, that's exactly right.)  
**Yume:** Onee-sans, you're getting this wrong. The plan to erode it all... I'm the one who wants to do it.  
**Yume:** So long as... I get to stay together with everybody forever, I don't care. So long as this can go on forever, 
I don't care!  
**Kanami:** But...  
**Hiyori:** ...We're switching up, Kanami. She's... going to be tough.  
**Yume:** Ahahahahaha! Just wait, onee-sans! I'll beat you so fast and make you myouga!  
**Yume:** And then... You'll never, ever forget me!!
