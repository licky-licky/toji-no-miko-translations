<strong>Kanami:</strong> Reaching the finals means getting to participate in the tournament, so nobody wants to lose here! Let&#x27;s do our best!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> The strongest toji from every school bringing all kinds of styles together to fight... Who could pass that up~!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ugh... Just one more match and I would&#x27;ve safely guaranteed my way into the tournament... But of course I&#x27;m already up against the last boss...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I really wanted to save Kanami for the finals~.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Winning or losing doesn&#x27;t matter in the finals, so we could&#x27;ve had a friendly fight. But this way makes it so much more exciting!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> (...She says that, but I&#x27;m pretty sure Kanami&#x27;s stronger than me by a long shot...)<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> (Kanami&#x27;s always so carefree. Meanwhile, I&#x27;m freaking out over here... But!)<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I didn&#x27;t come all this way to lose! I want to make it to the tournament too! So let&#x27;s go!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Let&#x27;s do it! Let&#x27;s have fun together!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...! Yeah!<br>
<strong>Referee:</strong> The semi-finals for the tournament qualifiers will now begin. Bow!<br>
<strong>Mihono/Kanami:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Referee:</strong> --Begin!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> (Right... No, left! I can dodge it...)<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> (No way! I mistimed her attack!?)<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> (Amazing. Mihono-chan&#x27;s swordsmanship... I&#x27;ve never seen anything like this rhythm! She&#x27;s throwing off all my predictions!)<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> (What kind of tactic will she use next? Block, dodge, attack... What&#x27;s next?)<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> (I want to see it all. I want you to show me everything, Mihono-chan!)<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> (Whoa!? Kanami&#x27;s got a really dirty grin on her face!)<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> (But... I get it. --I&#x27;m enjoying this too!)<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> (I always used to think the difference between us was so great that she never had to try.)<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> (That her carefree attitude meant she&#x27;d just drag on the fight and end it whenever she wanted to.)<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> (But that&#x27;s wrong. Kanami has always been giving it everything she&#x27;s got... All so she can enjoy this moment!)<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> (I want to surprise Kanami even more with my skill... I want to beat Kanami!)<br>
<strong>Referee:</strong> That&#x27;s enough!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> .....Phew~!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I lost<del></del>!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I had no idea which of us would win right up till the end! That was such a good match~.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> But I let it end... This sucks. This really really sucks.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Mihono-chan...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Still... That was so much fun!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> ! Yeah, for me too! I had a great time-!<br>
<strong>Referee:</strong> Etou-san, you&#x27;ll be entering the finals shortly. Please prepare yourself.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah... Okay! I&#x27;ll be right there!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Good luck out there, Kanami!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Thanks! I&#x27;m going!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> ...I&#x27;m so glad. Mihono-chan enjoyed it as much as I did!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> But, at the end there, it seemed like Mihono-chan suddenly lost all her momentum... Did something happen to her?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ahh, my heart&#x27;s still pounding...! I didn&#x27;t have enough time to talk to her just now...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I&#x27;ll have to tell Mihono-chan later! Just how amazing her swordsmanship was!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="2-kanamis-slightly-weird-point"></a>2: Kanami&#x27;s Slightly Weird Point<a class="hash-link" href="#2-kanamis-slightly-weird-point" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ahh, today&#x27;s lessons really wore me out. I&#x27;m feeling hungry-!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I brought some cookies with me. Do you want them?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Eh, really!? Then let&#x27;s eat them together in my room!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I&#x27;m coming in~.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Oh? Did you get a new plushie?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah! That&#x27;s &quot;Eruption Angel Fabulous-san&quot;, from the recent anime &quot;Hell Angel Marvelous-chan&quot;!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Isn&#x27;t she cute!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Eh... S-She sure is. What a unique looking character.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> But apparently the ratings were so terrible that they shut the whole series down. Sigh... I was pretty shocked when I found out.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> For some reason, all the anime I like end up like that.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> These plushies were actually a part of a clearance sale. As soon as I found out, I knew I just had to give them a home!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> R-Really? ...Strangely enough, the more I look at it, it might be getting cuter...? Like I can&#x27;t take my eyes off it.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> That&#x27;s it! It&#x27;s that bit of ugliness that makes her so cute!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> You have some slightly strange tastes, Kanami-chan.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> You think so? She might look a little too ugly for you now, but I bet if you watched the anime you&#x27;d fall in love!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Ufufu, I&#x27;m getting a little interested with the way you keep insisting, Kanami-chan.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> You should try it!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> By the way, can we eat those cookies now? My stomach&#x27;s at its limit~.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Of course!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Hooray-!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> ...Mmm! They&#x27;re as good as ever!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Fufu, thanks.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Oh, I know! You can have one of my &quot;Hell Angel Marvelous-chan&quot; plushies, Mai-chan!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Eh, are you sure?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Consider it thanks for all the tasty cookies!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> You can have &quot;Eruption Angel Fabulous-san&quot;&#x27;s best friend, &quot;Thunderclap Angel Glamorous-sama&quot;!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Ahaha, you don&#x27;t need to thank me. But if you really want me to, I&#x27;ll take it.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah! Take good care of her!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="3-worry-consultation"></a>3: Worry Consultation<a class="hash-link" href="#3-worry-consultation" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Kanami:</strong> Sigh......<br>
<strong>Morishita Kihiro:</strong> Whoa there, unfamiliar toji! Something troubling you?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Uwaah!? W-Where&#x27;d you come from!?<br>
<strong>Kihiro:</strong> Allow me to introduce myself! From Ayanokouji Martial Arts School&#x27;s Equipment Department, Morishita Kihiro, at your service!<br>
<strong>Kihiro:</strong> Want to get stronger? Want to get faster? I&#x27;ll solve whatever&#x27;s got you down~!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> ...... Um...... I&#x27;ll be fine.<br>
<strong>Kihiro:</strong> What!? What&#x27;s with that reaction, like I&#x27;m some sort of suspicious salesman!?<br>
<strong>Kihiro:</strong> Did my sudden appearance startle you that much!? Or, don&#x27;t tell me, there&#x27;s a toji out there who doesn&#x27;t want to get stronger!?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> ! ......<br>
<strong>Kihiro:</strong> ...Was I actually right?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> No way! Of course I want to get stronger! I want to keep improving, but...<br>
<strong>Kihiro:</strong> Can&#x27;t quite express it, huh~? Well how about sharing your thoughts with a passing stranger such as myself?<br>
<strong>Kihiro:</strong> If it&#x27;s something serious, don&#x27;t think you some complicated reason to tell us in the Equipment Department.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> ...I really love swordfighting. I love it so much that I just want to keep fighting all kinds of people and seeing all kinds of techniques.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> When I&#x27;m in a match, it feels like it would be a waste to let it end. So I find myself holding back sometimes to let it last longer. It&#x27;s not like I mean to of course, but it just happens by accident.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> But if my opponent is trying so hard and I&#x27;m not...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Isn&#x27;t that really disrespectful? It&#x27;s been bothering me.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> That&#x27;s why, I want to get stronger... But I can&#x27;t bring myself to ask for it.<br>
<strong>Kihiro:</strong> Hmm, hmm~. I see, I see~.<br>
<strong>Kihiro:</strong> However! If you had to ask if you&#x27;d fooled or disrespected anyone, my answer&#x27;s a big NO!<br>
<strong>Kihiro:</strong> Holding back is simply one of the many options a fight gives you.<br>
<strong>Kihiro:</strong> It&#x27;s only natural for the strong to have options! And the weak are of course limited in what they can do.<br>
<strong>Kihiro:</strong> Giving you those options is the reason why we developers work alongside you toji fellows day after day.<br>
<strong>Kihiro:</strong> Rather! For you to reject me giving you such power, for you to limit your own options...<br>
<strong>Kihiro:</strong> For you to deny all the efforts I&#x27;ve done for you, miss toji, is far more disrespectful!! ...At least, that&#x27;s how I feel.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> ...An option? Huh... I never thought of it like that.<br>
<strong>Kihiro:</strong> Then again, it&#x27;s only my personal opinion, so take it with a grain of salt.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> ...Okay. I&#x27;m still not convinced, but... I feel a little less worried about it.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I&#x27;m glad we talked. You weren&#x27;t kidding when you said you&#x27;d solve whatever&#x27;s got me down.<br>
<strong>Kihiro:</strong> The pleasure&#x27;s all mine.<br>
<strong>Kihiro:</strong> So. Now that that&#x27;s settled...<br>
<strong>Kihiro:</strong> My friend and fellow, who&#x27;s looking to broaden her options~! It just so happens I&#x27;ve developed some fresh new equipment! You&#x27;d like to test it out, wouldn&#x27;t you!?<br>
<strong>Kihiro:</strong> How lucky I am, to come across a willing guin... Rather, to have brought a poor toji lost like a zombie back to her senses.<br>
<strong>Kihiro:</strong> Allow me to measure again and again your precision, your endurance, how it feels to wear, etc! For one as strong as you, I won&#x27;t take no for an answer!!<br>
<strong>Kihiro:</strong> Ah, on that note, I&#x27;d like you to try this legwear on. We&#x27;re going to be rather relentless in testing your skills with jin&#x27;i, so do your best to hang in there!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Y-You really are trying to sell me something!?  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="4-swordfighting-idiot-in-the-library"></a>4: Swordfighting Idiot in the Library<a class="hash-link" href="#4-swordfighting-idiot-in-the-library" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Kanami:</strong> Hmm...? Hmm......<br>
<strong>Fukuda Sawano:</strong> Nice to see you hard at work. You seem very enthusiastic.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah, the lord of the library... Er, wait, you&#x27;re...<br>
<strong>Sawano:</strong> My name is Fukuda Sawano. ...Is &quot;lord&quot; the nickname the underclassmen gave me?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ahaha, sorry... You&#x27;re always in the library, Sawano-san, so...<br>
<strong>Sawano:</strong> There aren&#x27;t many who come here in the first place, so it&#x27;s pretty strange, isn&#x27;t it? I&#x27;ve seen you around a few times, though.<br>
<strong>Sawano:</strong> Do you like reading books?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> No, well, if I had to say one way or the other, I&#x27;m pretty bad with them... But this is different!<br>
<strong>Sawano:</strong> That&#x27;s... Oh, I see, a manual of swordfighting techniques.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Whenever I see something new in a match or around the dojo, I just can&#x27;t help myself.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> So I come look it up in the library. There&#x27;s lots of books on swordfighting in here, after all. It&#x27;s really useful in showing me what I want to know!<br>
<strong>Sawano:</strong> That&#x27;s right, that&#x27;s right! Minoseki&#x27;s library has an extensive and wonderful collection!<br>
<strong>Sawano:</strong> And yet, for it to be so deserted... It&#x27;s such a waste of resources!<br>
<strong>Sawano:</strong> That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m so glad to see someone passionate like yourself making use of it!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> You really love the library, don&#x27;t you? But I&#x27;m not as good at researching as someone like you, so it&#x27;s a little difficult.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Like now, it&#x27;s hard finding specifics about the technique I&#x27;m looking for...<br>
<strong>Sawano:</strong> Then how about I help you? Just wait here a moment. Let&#x27;s see...<br>
<strong>Sawano:</strong> How about this? An illustrated reference book on practicing techniques. You reminded me of this book just now.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ahh, it&#x27;s in here, I didn&#x27;t even know what its name was! You&#x27;re so knowledgeable, Sawano-san!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Wow...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Hmm.........<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> ...I get it, so that&#x27;s why you move like that... And then......<br>
<strong>Sawano:</strong> And, if you want to know more about its practical uses, this book will cover that. Also, this book here is fiction, but its portrayal of it is surprisingly faithful!<br>
<strong>Sawano:</strong> This book is my personal recommendation though. It covers the history of the school from its creation, giving by far the most thorough explanation of their...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> ......Sawano-san, I&#x27;m sorry!<br>
<strong>Sawano:</strong> Eh?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Now that I&#x27;ve learned about it, my body&#x27;s itching to try it! I&#x27;m going to go practice in the simulator!<br>
--The next day.</p><p><strong>Sawano:</strong> Ah.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Sawano-san! H-Hello.<br>
<strong>Sawano:</strong> Fufufu. You never came back yesterday.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I got carried away... I stayed in the simulator until they ran out of defenders.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Sorry. I know you picked out all those books for me...<br>
<strong>Sawano:</strong> No, I&#x27;m the one who got carried away. I pushed too much on you...<br>
<strong>Sawano:</strong> Mm! Have you heard this saying? &quot;Knowledge has no value until put into practice.&quot;<br>
<strong>Sawano:</strong> By immediately applying the knowledge you&#x27;ve learned like that, that would make you a first class reader, in a sense.<br>
<strong>Sawano:</strong> ...That&#x27;s just second-hand knowledge, though.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ehehe, thank you. I&#x27;ll come back if there&#x27;s anything else I want to learn!<br>

<strong>Kanami:</strong> I tried pretty hard this time!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Hehe, someone&#x27;s confident! Meanwhile, Rika lied to me-.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> She kept crying about how she had a bad feeling, but then her score was as great as ever!<br>
<strong>Subara Rika:</strong> I wasn&#x27;t lying~. I really thought I did terrible on this test.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ahh-! Ahh-! I don&#x27;t wanna hear it-! I only talk to people on my level~!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Like, let&#x27;s see what Kanami got... Wait...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Huhhh!? What the!?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ehh!? Did I really do that bad?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> No, it&#x27;s just... Isn&#x27;t this totally the average!?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Teachers always get mad at you for not paying attention, so I figured you didn&#x27;t study at all...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I said I tried really hard this time!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> After all, after my grades were so low last time, Mai-chan said she&#x27;d help me study all I wanted whenever I wanted!<br>
<strong>Rika:</strong> That sounds like what it&#x27;d take to get Kanami to study.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah, that&#x27;s Kanami for you...! But it&#x27;s too much for you to become a better student!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> You&#x27;re already so good at fighting, so you have to have a weakness!<br>
<strong>Rika:</strong> I&#x27;m not a fighter myself, so I don&#x27;t really know how good she is there, but...<br>
<strong>Rika:</strong> It&#x27;s funny. I never would have thought Kanami-chan would be the type that&#x27;s good at everything.<br>
<strong>Rika:</strong> Didn&#x27;t you say you could cook too?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> No way!?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Well, you know, it&#x27;s just my dad, my brother, and I. So with the way we organize household chores, I always had to take care of cooking.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I always thought we were in this together... I never thought you&#x27;d be so good at everything on top of swordfighting...<br>
<strong>Rika:</strong> From that reaction, Mihono-chan must be bad at cooking too.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah, but I did screw up my cooking recently!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I put out a pot to boil for 5 minutes and thought I could fit in some mental training, but...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Next thing I knew the stove was almost on fire! I gotta remember not to think about swordfighting when I&#x27;m cooking~.<br>
<strong>Rika:</strong> Of course it had something to do with swordfighting. Kanami-chan&#x27;s obsessed with it, after all.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> So if I don&#x27;t get at least that obsessed, I&#x27;ll never beat Kanami...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Rika, to be like Kanami, I&#x27;m going to have to focus more and more on swordfighting! If there&#x27;s a will... There&#x27;s a way!<br>
<strong>Rika:</strong> Mihono-chan...

<strong>Kanami:</strong> Sorry about that, Mai-chan. But, I just want to see how all kinds of different people fight.<br>
<strong>Sawano:</strong> I&#x27;m alright with fighting you, but... As you know, I&#x27;m only the &quot;Lord of the Library&quot;.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ahaha, sorry about when I called you that...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> But actually, after that, I heard you were a very reliable fighter, so I wanted to try facing off with you at least once!<br>
<strong>Sawano:</strong> ...I understand. Show me the skills of someone who&#x27;s spent more time in books than anyone.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Yesss! Thank you very much!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Kanami-chan&#x27;s spent more time in books than anyone...?<br>

<strong>Kanami:</strong> I ended up winning.<br>
<strong>Minato:</strong> Hey, that&#x27;s great!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Minato:</strong> What&#x27;s wrong? You don&#x27;t look too happy about it?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> No, I&#x27;m pretty happy I won. It&#x27;s just, I wanted to keep fighting on and on...<br>
<strong>Minato:</strong> You&#x27;re saying you didn&#x27;t even get to hit your stride? Now you&#x27;re getting cocky about it.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> It&#x27;s not like that!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I want to fight more and more, so I can be like you.<br>
<strong>Minato:</strong> You&#x27;re starting all these matches to be more like me?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> That&#x27;s because, you aren&#x27;t there in the real world... If you were there, then I wouldn&#x27;t have to.<br>
<strong>Minato:</strong> That sounds like it&#x27;d be a real waste. You&#x27;re finally getting to fight people besides me.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> It&#x27;d be a waste?<br>
<strong>Minato:</strong> Each and every fight means you get more people to &quot;Look close! Listen well! Focus on your senses!&quot; with.<br>

<strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah! Please, Mai-chan!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> You know I don&#x27;t mind, but, where is this coming from?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> We always practice together, but I hardly know anything about you. So I was thinking, we could get to know each other better like this.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> You want to know more about me...?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ehehe, sorry for asking you something so weird out of nowhere. When I woke up this morning, I just had this on my mind.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I don&#x27;t quite understand, but... Alright. And if you&#x27;re that eager about it, then I&#x27;m going to come at you with all I&#x27;ve got!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Thanks, Mai-chan! Then, let&#x27;s get started!<br>

<strong>Kanami:</strong> (Stare...)<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> (Wait? Kanami-chan is acting differently than usual...?)<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> (But, if that&#x27;s the case, I might be able to fight against her...!)<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> (Ah, Mai-chan&#x27;s stance changed. Woww, the way she&#x27;s angling her sword is beautiful. It looks flexible at a glance, but I can tell she&#x27;s holding it firm from her center.)<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> (Oh, she closed the distance between us just a little bit! I get it... She&#x27;s looking to see how I&#x27;ll react. Then, if I move like this...)<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> (Kanami-chan lowered her body...! Is she preparing to charge? Then, I&#x27;ll...)<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> (Mai-chan took in a deep breath...! Maybe she&#x27;s looking to set up a counter? But, in that stance, what would it look like...?)<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> (Mmmm, I can&#x27;t picture it at all... But... In that case, I just have to see for myself!)<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> (There it is! Kanami-chan moves so fast! But, I should be able to--)<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> YAAAA!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Aww, I lost... You&#x27;re too tough for me after all, Kanami-chan...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> No way, you were great too, Mai-chan! When you came rushing out back there, I wasn&#x27;t expecting it at all!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> That was Hokushin Itto-Ryu&#x27;s &quot;Kiri-otoshi&quot;, right?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Yep, you got it.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I knew it! Please, Mai-chan! Show it to me again!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Fufu, I guess I don&#x27;t have a choice.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Awesome-!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> And, after that, I want to try using your move myself, so will you have another match with me too?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Please! I&#x27;m begging you!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Then, on the other hand, I&#x27;ll try moving like you did, Kanami-chan.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> You&#x27;re the best, Mai-chan-!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> (Look close. Listen well. Focus on your senses.)<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> (Just by keeping that in mind, swordfighting gets so much more interesting...!)<br>

<strong>Kanami:</strong> I know! I couldn&#x27;t believe it either.<br>

<strong>Mai:</strong> It&#x27;s a little unfortunate everyone couldn&#x27;t all make it at the same time.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> But still, everyone will be here by the afternoon... And Yui-chan and Tsugumi-san should get here soon!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> While we wait for them, let&#x27;s have some fun together!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Sure!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Though, what can we do with the two of us?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I&#x27;d be alright with just swimming, but... With two of us, it&#x27;d definitely turn into a competition.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> And also, that wouldn&#x27;t be any different from PE class.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> That&#x27;s true... Then, what about something like, going against the current in the river pool? Yeah! That could be a great full body exercise!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Aren&#x27;t you just looking to do more training, Kanami-chan!? Didn&#x27;t we come here to enjoy ourselves today?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah... That&#x27;s just where my mind started going to... Sorry, Mai-chan!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> It&#x27;s nothing to apologize over. It&#x27;s very like you, Kanami-chan.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Come up with something good for me, please!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Fufu, I&#x27;ll give it a shot!<br>

<strong>Kuroko:</strong> Yes, entirely. Though, the one thing I&#x27;m still not used to is sleeping apart from Onee-sama.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> You two sure are close, aren&#x27;t you. Misaka-san and Shirai-san.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> Just so you don&#x27;t get the wrong idea, we only sleep in the same dorm room together... It&#x27;s not like we sleep in the same bed.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> It&#x27;s okay, we get it.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> And also, I&#x27;m used to living here too. You do a lot for us. And just having to shoot aradama with electricity is easy for me.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I&#x27;m glad to hear it. What about you, Shokuhou-san? Is anything bothering you?<br>
<strong>Misaki:</strong> I&#x27;m doing just fine too. It&#x27;s pretty fresh, this lifestyle over heree.<br>
--[clatter]</p><p><strong>Kanami:</strong> Shokuhou-san, you dropped something just now. ...Is this a remote?<br>
<strong>Misaki:</strong> Thank youu, Etou-san.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Why are you carrying a remote around with you?<br>
<strong>Misaki:</strong> Hmm, why exactlyy? Why do you think that is, Etou-san?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> If you ask me, I think you can leave a remote in whichever room it belongs.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Maybe if you have to lend a remote to somebody, but I&#x27;ve never had to. What about you, Mai?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> There was one time Kanami-chan has said she couldn&#x27;t find her remote, so I brought mine over to her room, but I think that&#x27;s about it?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ahaha... My room was a real mess then.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah, I know! You didn&#x27;t have a remote, and, when you were on your way home from buying one, you went to see Misaka-san&#x27;s experiment!<br>
<strong>Misaki:</strong> If that were the case, would you just happen to be carrying one with you?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Thinking about it normally, I can&#x27;t imagine why you&#x27;d carry one around, so does it have something to do with your power after all, Shokuhou-san?<br>
<strong>Misaki:</strong> Well, maybee.<br>
<strong>Misaki:</strong> I haven&#x27;t felt like using my power in this world, but, by force of habit, I end up bringing it with mee.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I really wanna know what kind of power you&#x27;re hiding-!<br>
<strong>Misaki:</strong> Then, how about you try guessing what it is? If you get it right, I&#x27;ll let you knoww. But, each person only gets one guess.<br>
<strong>Misaki:</strong> And, Misaka-san, Shirai-san, giving them hints is off limits, understood?<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> I get it.<br>
<strong>Kuroko:</strong> This is another form of recreation. I wouldn&#x27;t do something so rude.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> So you two really do know after all.<br>
<strong>Kuroko:</strong> Anyone in Academy City, whether or not they were aware of the full details, would have heard of just what power a level 5 like Shokuhou Misaki has.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I guess that makes sense, since she has a strong power. But still, what kind of power could it be?  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="railgun---kanami-end-it-could-be-that-kind-of-power"></a>[Railgun - Kanami: End]: It Could Be That Kind of Power!<a class="hash-link" href="#railgun---kanami-end-it-could-be-that-kind-of-power" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Yume:</strong> A power that uses a TV remote, huh-.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Remotes turn things on and off and can change the channels, but does that have anything to do with it?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Hmm~...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ah, I got it! It&#x27;s a power to make machines do whatever you want!<br>
<strong>Misaki:</strong> Bzzt-. Tsubakuro-san, that&#x27;s wrongg.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh-, but I was sure that was it-!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I was thinking something like that too, but I guess not. Then, is it a power that can send a sort of message to people far away? Like telepathy.<br>
<strong>Misaki:</strong> You were closee, but Yanase-san got it wrong too.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I thought it might send some sort of signal, but it&#x27;s hard to narrow down, isn&#x27;t it.<br>
<strong>Misaki:</strong> You&#x27;re the only one left, Etou-san.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Give it your best shot, Kanami-chan.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> My answer is, simply-- A beam!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Huh?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Kanami-chan?<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> ...A beam? What made you think that??<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I was thinking, instead of a signal coming out the end of the remote to turn things off and on, it could shoot out a beam like, &quot;Bibibibi-!&quot;<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Kind of like, like this!<br>
<strong>Misaki:</strong> Fufufu, Etou-san. Now that you&#x27;ve learned the secret of my power, I won&#x27;t be letting you off so easy~.<br>
<strong>Misaki:</strong> Take thiis, bibibibibibi-!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Wahh! Save me, Shirai-san!<br>
<strong>Kuroko:</strong> This way! Etou-san!<br>
<strong>Misaki:</strong> I can shoot a beam with lots of different effects, so you can&#x27;t escape my beams~.<br>
<strong>Misaki:</strong> Take this, and that! Ahahahaha!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> And basically, Shokuhou-san&#x27;s power is to control a beam that changes depending on the buttons she pushes!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Kanami-onee-san, that whole thing you acted out... What was that?<br>
<strong>Kuroko:</strong> And also, why did I appear in this fantasy of yours?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I mean, it just felt right for a battle between people with superpowers, so it popped in my head. Anyway, did I get it right?<br>
<strong>Misaki:</strong> Nope, my power isn&#x27;t like that.<br>
<strong>Misaki:</strong> If I did have a beamm, I&#x27;d have helped you defeat the aradama a little.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I guess that&#x27;s true.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> You think? If you had a power like that, even if you tried to help out, you&#x27;d be so out of shape you&#x27;d just slow us down for sure.<br>
<strong>Misaki:</strong> Sighh... Why don&#x27;t we ignore Misaka-san, who cant go through a tiny hypothetical without showing her powers of rudeness, and have some more tea?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> More tea sounds good, but let&#x27;s have it with Misaka-san too!<br>
<strong>Misaki:</strong> If we mustt. As a prize just for trying, I&#x27;ll allow Misaka-san to join us.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> Don&#x27;t treat me like a consolation prize just because I was right.<br>

It is all for the sake of Starlight!</p><p><strong>Kanami:</strong> Wow-, being able to recite a line like that so smoothly; people training to be pros sure are something else.<br>
<strong>Hikari:</strong> I am a stage girl, so this much is natural.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Even still, it&#x27;s pretty amazing.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Oh yeah, thanks, Hikari-chan.<br>
<strong>Hikari:</strong> What? Why are you thanking me suddenly?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> For sparring with me. I&#x27;m really happy you agreed!<br>
<strong>Hikari:</strong> I just thought this experience might be useful on the stage. Are you ready?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I&#x27;m ready to go anytime!<br>
<strong>Hikari:</strong> Then... --YAH!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> That was a nice thrust, Hikari-chan! Now I&#x27;ll go! HAAH!<br>
<strong>Hikari:</strong> ...Kh! Then, I&#x27;ll--!<br>
<strong>Hikari:</strong> ...You&#x27;re watching my movements closely.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> That&#x27;s good! Show me more and more, Hikari-chan, of the way that you fight!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="stage-girl---kanami-end-it-is-all-for-the-sake-of-starlight"></a>[Stage Girl - Kanami: End]: It Is All for the Sake of Starlight!<a class="hash-link" href="#stage-girl---kanami-end-it-is-all-for-the-sake-of-starlight" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Hikari:</strong> ...There-!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> !? That was a little risky just now!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> You&#x27;re using the spring in your body to get even sharper with your strikes! That was a great thrust!<br>
<strong>Hikari:</strong> ...You were able to dodge that just now? Toji really do have great physical performance.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> It&#x27;s important to be able to avoid taking hits in battle, after all. That&#x27;s a part of training too.<br>
<strong>Hikari:</strong> Then, what will you do if I do this?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Eh!? You threw your weapon!?<br>
<strong>Hikari:</strong> Thank you. You deflected it just how I wanted you to.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Wawah!? ...She&#x27;s flying with a wire!?<br>
<strong>Hikari:</strong> And now--!!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Seeing that attack just now you did with the wire sent a chill up my spine-. You were right up in front of me all of a sudden.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> So you can fight like that too, huh!<br>
<strong>Hikari:</strong> ...You blocked it so easily though.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I mean, if I didn&#x27;t block that right, I&#x27;d be done for. It wasn&#x27;t easy for me at all.<br>
<strong>Hikari:</strong> There&#x27;s something I want to ask you... Why did you decide to have a match with me?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Because I saw you not even flinching as you were fighting aradama, I guess.<br>
<strong>Hikari:</strong> That should be the same for the other stage girls too. We all want the auditions to resume soon.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> You&#x27;re right, but you were still a little different after all. I think it would be scary to fight with that short sword-like dagger, Hikari-chan.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> But still, you have a strong determination to fight. That&#x27;s the feeling I got. So that&#x27;s why I wanted to spar with you.<br>
<strong>Hikari:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> And once we got down to it, it was super exciting!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah! I wish I could try moving around with wires like you did, Hikari-chan-.<br>
<strong>Hikari:</strong> You can&#x27;t; I won&#x27;t give it to you.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I can&#x27;t-? That&#x27;s a bit of a shame!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Hey. Hikari-chan, what did you think of sparring with me?<br>
<strong>Hikari:</strong> Hm, real swordfighting was incredible. Teach me. Even if it&#x27;s only the basic movements.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Sure thing! I&#x27;ll welcome anybody interested in swordfighting with open arms! We&#x27;ll start with your stance, okay?<br>
<strong>Hikari:</strong> This kind of seems like it could take a while... But, I&#x27;ll be in your care.  </p><div class="videoWrapper"><iframe width="640" height="480" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KlIqfSZ3Cl8"></iframe></div><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="valkyrie---kanami-start-lets-do-a-survey"></a>[Valkyrie - Kanami: Start]: Let&#x27;s Do a Survey<a class="hash-link" href="#valkyrie---kanami-start-lets-do-a-survey" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Kanami:</strong> Promotional photos?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Yep, promotional photos.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> They say it&#x27;s to extend the scope of activities for those who were chosen in the Miss Five Traditions contest, so we&#x27;ll all be taking them.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> What a pain-.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> They could just use the photos on our IDs for that.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Would ID photos work?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> ...That definitely wouldn&#x27;t work, would it?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> And, about that, I have a photo studio I&#x27;d prefer to use, so could we all take our pictures there?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Sure, that sounds nice.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Wait just a moment----!!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...Where&#x27;d you even come from.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> I heard the whole thing!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Were you eavesdropping?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> You&#x27;re making me sound bad, Saaya!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> And anyway, since you have this chance to take promotional photos, it wouldn&#x27;t be any fun to take any everyday kind of picture!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> This is a proper activity we were tasked to do, so isn&#x27;t it fine if it&#x27;s not fun?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> That&#x27;s a no, Maimai!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> The mission of Miss Five Traditions was to help cheer up people across the world!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Which means, we need to come up for something starting with this photo shoot!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> You know... I think Ellen-chan might be right!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...Are you really okay with this?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Don&#x27;t get won over by her smooth talking. She&#x27;s just here to amuse herself.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> That&#x27;s still fine! I don&#x27;t think what Ellen-chan&#x27;s saying is wrong.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> I knew I could count on you, Kanamin!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> So then... Let&#x27;s start right off with a survey over the internet!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Kanamin&#x27;s promotional shots will be her in... These!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> An aradama hoodie, a Nenegurumi, or a valkyrie costume!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> None of those are good for promotional shots!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> But... They might look cute.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm, I want to see all of them.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Y-You think so?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> You guys... Don&#x27;t come crying to me when it&#x27;s your turn to put that on.<br>

<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Since I&#x27;ll be having my photos taken at Mai&#x27;s studio.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="valkyrie---kanami-end-all-in-the-same-boat"></a>[Valkyrie - Kanami: End]: All in the Same Boat?<a class="hash-link" href="#valkyrie---kanami-end-all-in-the-same-boat" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Ellen:</strong> We got the results back from Kanamin&#x27;s survey!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> It&#x27;s so tense...!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> They all put up a good fight, but... The winner in the end was the valkyrie costume!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...Promotional photos of a valkyrie, huh.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Ellen-chan, leave making the costume to me! I&#x27;ll make the perfect valkyrie costume to match Kanami-chan!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Please do, Maimai! I&#x27;ll be in charge of getting the scene ready!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mai and Ellen are fired up...<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...Sigh.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> So, what&#x27;re we doing about you two, Sayaka and Mai?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> We haven&#x27;t overlooked a thing! We&#x27;re coming up with the greatest costume plans for all of you!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> You&#x27;re doing it for me too!?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Well of course I am!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> (A valkyrie... I can&#x27;t wait to see what the costume looks like!)<br>
Kanami&#x27;s promotional photos... The day of shooting.</p><p><strong>Kanami:</strong> A-Am I... really going to wear this? It sure is revealing around the shoulders and places...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> (...I told you so.)<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I think it&#x27;ll really look nice on you, Kanami-chan! I&#x27;m proud of how it turned out!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong>  S-Sure... Ellen-chan?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> It&#x27;s too late to change anything, Kanamin.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> The scene is all set too, and we already got approval from the Sword Administration Bureau!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> That&#x27;s why I warned you.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I should&#x27;ve listened to you, Hiyori-chan...<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> It&#x27;s alright, Kanami. Everybody here... We all got dragged into this with you.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Kaoru-chan...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> (I already finished taking mine though.)<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Kanami. Mai got it ready for you, so I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll look good.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Y-Yeah... Y-You&#x27;re right...<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ?<br>
<strong>Staff:</strong> We&#x27;ve finished setting up for the shoot-! Etou-san, we&#x27;re all ready for you-!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> ...Alright!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> So then, these are my promotional shots...<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Kanami-chan! You look so cute!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...Yeah, the photos do have an atmosphere to them.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> The cameraman was so good that I started really having fun with getting my pictures taken.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> And, I think that really came through with how good they look!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Kanami, you&#x27;re making a nice face.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> So this is a promotional photo...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> See, everyone&#x27;s loving it! What about you, Kaoru?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Yeah, yeah, I was wrong. I think it&#x27;s pretty good.<br>

Thank you for going out of your way to stop by the lab today.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> What was it you wanted Sayaka-chan and me to do?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I&#x27;m actually working with a new game utilizing the VR technology in development here in the lab... And, we were looking for play testers.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> A new game!? That sounds fun! Don&#x27;t you want to try it, Sayaka-chan?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Sayaka-chan? What&#x27;s wrong? You don&#x27;t look too happy.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Tsugumi made that, didn&#x27;t she... Kofuki said, &quot;Watch out with stuff she&#x27;s made&quot;... Will it be alright?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> It&#x27;s true that a lot has happened with Shichinosato-san... But you don&#x27;t need to worry, Kitora-san is working with me this time.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> And we&#x27;ve proven it to be perfectly safe. We have provided a simple battle stage, but the primary goal of the game is to enjoy a virtual environment.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Enjoy a virtual environment? Does that mean you can do things like fly around and make friends with the locals?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> That&#x27;s right. We&#x27;ve put quite a lot of effort into the details on that end, so please look forward to it.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> If you befriend the townspeople, they can provide you with food and sweets, and invite you to parties... We&#x27;ve included fun features like that.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Sounds fun! Sayaka-chan, I want to try it out!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm... But, I&#x27;m fine with sweets in the real world...<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Is that right. Incidentally, we&#x27;ve prepared a prize for the person that achieves the highest score in the game&#x27;s battle stage.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> A prize!? What do we get?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Kitora-san is out right now picking up cream puffs, but it seems she&#x27;ll need to wait in line, as the store is fairly popular.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Creme puffs from a store with a line... Kanami. I&#x27;ll try it.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Nice-! Then, we&#x27;ll be in your care, Tsugumi-san.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Thank you for participating. Then, getting right to it, let&#x27;s put on the equipment. And, I&#x27;ll explain how to use it...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> It sure has a lot of features! It&#x27;s giving me goosebumps. Alright, here I go-!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Wow-- So cool! Is this seriously the world inside the game? It looks like a real city-!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm, the city at night... It&#x27;s really beautiful...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Wahh, look, look, Sayaka-chan! I&#x27;m flying in the air!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> I&#x27;ll try it too... That&#x27;s amazing... I can fly...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Give me your hand and we&#x27;ll fly up to the top of that building!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Okay.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Whoa-! We&#x27;re flying between buildings like a couple of birds-! It&#x27;s like I&#x27;m dreaming!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm... This is fun. Ah... Someone is waving their arm from a window...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> They are! Evening-! This is a really nice city you&#x27;ve got here-.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> It looks like they&#x27;re saying something. What do you think it is?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Let&#x27;s fly over next to the window then!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Whoa! There&#x27;s a bunch of tasty looking cakes on the inside. Eh? You&#x27;re giving us these, to welcome us? Lucky us, Sayaka-chan.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm. Since we&#x27;re here, we should try them.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I wonder what cakes in virtual reality taste like. We&#x27;ll take you up on that right away...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Wait, that sound! Something&#x27;s wrong with the city!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Is this the battle stage Tsugumi talked about? I&#x27;ll try my best, for everyone in the city and for the cream puffs.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ughhh, that&#x27;s right, but... There&#x27;s all these good looking cakes right in front of us-!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="vr-suit---kanami-end-clear-reward"></a>[VR Suit - Kanami: End]: Clear Reward<a class="hash-link" href="#vr-suit---kanami-end-clear-reward" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Kanami:</strong> Whoa!

<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm. Fighting without an okatana... It feels new.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> You&#x27;re really good at this, Sayaka-chan.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> You&#x27;re good too, Kanami.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Do you think we cleared the battle stage? The townspeople who hid are coming back.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> That&#x27;s good... We protected the people in this world too.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> There&#x27;s that person who was waving at us from the window earlier! Heyyy!<br>
<strong>Townsperson:</strong> Thank you very much for protecting our town. As thanks, we&#x27;ve prepared a feast for you, so please come with me.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> A feast?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Let&#x27;s go, Sayaka-chan!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Amazing... There&#x27;s an impressive feast...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Is it really okay for us to have all this?<br>
<strong>Townsperson:</strong> Of course! You can have as much of the cakes you didn&#x27;t get to eat earlier as you want too. Please, take your time.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> If you say so, then I won&#x27;t hold back. Let&#x27;s dig in-! [munch munch]... No way! This is as tasty as real cake!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> It really is. ...It&#x27;s sweet and delicious.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Sayaka-chan, this steak and sushi here are good too! It&#x27;s hard to believe this is actually part of a game!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm, it&#x27;s really delicious... I feel like I could eat this forever.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> That&#x27;s for sure. [chew chew] Mmmm, so good! Can I have seconds, please-!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Phew~. My stomach&#x27;s so full I can&#x27;t eat another bite!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Me too. I feel full. I want to bring some back for Mai and everyone.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Good idea! Excuse me-, could we get this cake to go?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Hm? When that sound plays, does that mean the game&#x27;s over? But the cake isn&#x27;t boxed up yet-!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Welcome back. How was the virtual world?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Tsugumi-san, that game was too cool! It was sooo much fun, and the food was really tasty too!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> We ate a lot, until we were full...... Hm?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Sayaka-chan? What&#x27;s wrong?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Even though I ate so much... I feel hungry...?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> That&#x27;s so weird; me too! I was stuffing my mouth just a few minutes ago too-.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Everything you experienced in there was virtual, after all. When you return here, you&#x27;ll be in the state you were in before you started.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Is that why... It&#x27;s strange, after I ate so much.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah, come to think of it, can we have those cream puffs? Sayaka-chan worked really hard beating the enemies.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Unfortunately, it seems that Kitora-san is still waiting in line. And also, those will only be given out as a prize to the top scorer after we get more people to play.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Oh, huh-.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Sayaka-chan, Kanami-chan, there you are.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Mai-chan! Why are you here?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> [sniff sniff]... I smell Mai&#x27;s cookies.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Fufufu, you got it right, Sayaka-chan. I baked some cookies and thought we could have them together, so I came to find you.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Yay-, I&#x27;m glad to hear it! Who&#x27;d have thought Mai-chan would bring cookies at just the right time! I&#x27;ll have some-!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> I&#x27;m glad too. Mai, I&#x27;ll have some. [munch much]... They&#x27;re tasty!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah, yeah!

<strong>Hiyori:</strong> That&#x27;s what it looks like.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> For some reason, it feels like it&#x27;s been a while since I saw you.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> We&#x27;ve both been busy being sent out all over the place.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I&#x27;m not as bad as Kaoru-chan, but it makes me want a vacation too.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> A vacation, huh. Seems like that&#x27;ll be unlikely for a while.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> But, assuming we could get a vacation, what would you want to do?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Hmm... I&#x27;d want to go on a trip, I guess?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Going on a trip... That doesn&#x27;t sound too bad. Would be nice to go to some hot springs and heal off all the daily fatigue.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Where do you want to go, Kanami?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Hmm, let&#x27;s see. I think I&#x27;d like to go on a trip overseas!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Like, to the USA, for example. I&#x27;d want Ellen-chan to take me around to all the American dojos!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> American dojos...? Well, that sounds like a trip you&#x27;d go on.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I&#x27;ll bet they feel different from the ones here in Japan, so it&#x27;ll be fun for sure!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> If you had Ellen with you, it&#x27;d probably get that much more noisy.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> And then, I&#x27;d want to go to the usual places, like Hawaii, and also, I think I&#x27;m interested in going to Europe too!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> To see the dojos there too?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah! I want to check it out! Though, how much western style swordfighting do you think is still around in Europe?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> As far as what level&#x27;s still in practice... I&#x27;m not really sure.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Though, Europe refers to a big place. There&#x27;s a lot of countries there, you know?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Was there any country you wanted to go visit in particular?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Hmm, I guess I&#x27;d have to see England first? I want to go to London!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> London... The most I know about it comes from Sherlock Holmes.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah! Sherlock Holmes! That&#x27;s good! When we get to London, let&#x27;s do stuff like Sherlock Holmes!<br>

<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Right. The jewels we&#x27;re after are on the inside.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah! But... They&#x27;re bound to have Scotland Yard&#x27;s finest on security, so we&#x27;d better be careful.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...If you&#x27;re going to warn me to be careful, try not giggling when you do it.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> But, come on, they&#x27;re going to have their top class guards stationed in there!?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> What kind of fighting style do you think they&#x27;ll use? Isn&#x27;t it exciting, Hiyori-chan!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Now you&#x27;re saying the polar opposite of before. Weren&#x27;t we supposed to be careful?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> We&#x27;ll have fun while we&#x27;re being careful!<br>

<strong>Kanami:</strong> See, Hiyori-chan. Holmes is a master of Baritsu, right?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> So I&#x27;d want to fight him. Which means, we&#x27;ve gotta be phantom thieves!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> &quot;Gotta be phantom thieves&quot;? Really!? And also, Holmes wasn&#x27;t even there!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Then maybe... Instead of working together, would it be a better setup if I came to steal you, Hiyori-chan?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> &quot;I&#x27;ve come to steal you away, Hiyori-chan!&quot; Like that.<br>

<strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> It&#x27;s going to be a long time before we can think about that vacation.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> That&#x27;s for sure. It&#x27;s disappointing, but, we won&#x27;t be able to vacation in peace until the aradama calm down some more.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> I know.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Once things settle down... Let&#x27;s all go on a trip together.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> When that time comes, I&#x27;ll go with you wherever, to London or anywhere.<br>

<strong>Mai:</strong> I&#x27;m glad you like it, Kanami-chan.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Did you bring this pie over to Sayaka-chan and them? She said she was filming a movie with Kitora-san, right?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Apparently the director from that time with the period drama invited them.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Mm-mm, I thought I&#x27;d let Sayaka-chan have it after she gets back.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I can be careful, but it would be bad if the pie were damaged on the way.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> That&#x27;s probably for the best. Ohm... The sweets you make really are delicious, Mai.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Thank you, Hiyori-chan. If you&#x27;d like, let&#x27;s make some together next time.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Alright. I&#x27;ve never made something like this before, but you teaching me would be a good chance to learn. I&#x27;ll be counting on you.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Sure!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ah, you three were in here!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Happy Halloween~! Kanami-chan, Hiyori-chan, annnd, Mai-chan! Trick or treat~?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Here, Yui-chan, have a bite of this.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Oh! Did you make this, Mai-chan? I&#x27;ll have some~. Mmm~, so good!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Yui-chan, were you looking for us for something?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I&#x27;m passing the word on from Kiyoka-chan. The costume party we&#x27;re having is going to be at an amusement park.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> So, anybody who wants to get seriously dressed up, meet in an hour out in front of school!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ehh, that&#x27;s so cool! Let&#x27;s go, Hiyori-chan, Mai-chan!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> We might as well.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> So, when Kiyoka said we could rent our costumes, she meant from the amusement park?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I&#x27;ve got to make the rounds and let the other girls know, so I&#x27;ll be seeing you later~.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> And, if you see anybody, be sure to tell them too, okay~?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> We got it-. Thanks, Yui-chan!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> How about we get going then?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah, sure! Though, we still have some time left, so I want to have at least one more slice of pie~.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Of course you can.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> The sweets you make are just addictively good, Mai-chan! Makes me want to have some every single day! Anyway-- down the hatch-.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="halloween-19---kanami-end-dressing-up-might-be-fun"></a>[Halloween &#x27;19 - Kanami: End]: Dressing Up Might be Fun!<a class="hash-link" href="#halloween-19---kanami-end-dressing-up-might-be-fun" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Kanami:</strong> I can&#x27;t wait to see what everyone&#x27;s costumes are like.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Come to think of it, what&#x27;s everybody else dressing up as? They said they had this and that.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ellen-chan said she&#x27;d be dressing up like a wolf, didn&#x27;t she? Yui-chan, do you know? For Kiyoka-chan and everybody.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I told Kiyoka-chan she should dress up like a witch and little red riding hood, but she wouldn&#x27;t wear those costumes in the end.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...You gave her something weird to wear, didn&#x27;t you?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Eh-- The skirt was just a liiittle bit short is all!?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ahaha... I&#x27;m pretty sure that&#x27;s the reason.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> But, I&#x27;d love to see Kiyoka-chan all dressed up in costume if I could. And Chie-san and Mihono-chan too, of course!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I&#x27;m sure you would, Yui-chan. We should hurry over there then.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Whoaa--! They&#x27;re even letting us take photos up here-!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> C&#x27;mon Hiyori-chan, get a good look.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Yeah, it&#x27;s a great view. I guess it&#x27;s how they set it up, but it really looks like nighttime.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> They&#x27;re probably trying to make it look more Halloween.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> But, is this really alright? Us taking photos here.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Seems like it&#x27;s fine. You can&#x27;t see it from right here, but just under this there&#x27;s a space and a fence to stop people from falling, just in case.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Safety first, even when you&#x27;re having fun.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> It&#x27;d be dangerous if little kids were jumping around, but a quick photo shoot should be fine.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> So, Kanami-chan, strike a pose for me!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> A pose? How&#x27;s this?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> That&#x27;s good, Kanami-chan, so good! It&#x27;s got that... &quot;This world of night belongs to me--&quot; feeling!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ehehe... Getting dressed up and cosplaying might be kinda fun?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah, Hiyori-chan. Since we&#x27;re both vampires, how about we get our picture taken together?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Alright. Can we get in a little closer?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> That might be tricky.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> What are you two saying? You&#x27;re pairing up for a shot, so you&#x27;ve got to get right up on each other!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> So close you&#x27;re practically hugging!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Wha!?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Like this?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...Ka-Kanami!? Th-That&#x27;s too close.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Niiice going, Kanami-chan~.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Doing this kind of thing is nice every now and then.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah. We should all go together for Halloween again next year!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah, but before that, there&#x27;s the cultural festival, Christmas, New Year&#x27;s, Valentines. There&#x27;s a lot of stuff that could be fun.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> There sure is.  </p><div class="videoWrapper"><iframe width="640" height="480" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wCKVDULo_UY"></iframe></div><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="easter---kanami-start-attempting-the-egg-hunt"></a>[Easter - Kanami: Start]: Attempting the Egg Hunt!<a class="hash-link" href="#easter---kanami-start-attempting-the-egg-hunt" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Ellen:</strong> Kanamin! Want to do an egg hunt with everyone, to celebrate Easter?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> An egg hunt? What&#x27;s that?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> It&#x27;s a fun event you do on Easter day. You hide colorful painted eggs in the park, and everyone competes to find them!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> That sounds fun! I knew you painted eggs for Easter, but I didn&#x27;t know there was a game to look for them!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> For starters, the day before we do the egg hunt, do you want to make Easter eggs?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah, I want to try! I&#x27;ll ask Hiyori-chan to come too!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Hiyori-chan wasn&#x27;t in the classrooms or the dorms; I wonder where she went...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Alright then, let&#x27;s all get started making Easter eggs! Go ahead and draw nice designs on the eggs we have here!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Huh? These eggs feel pretty light. What kind of eggs are they...? Wait, now that I look closer, there&#x27;s a hole in the bottom and it&#x27;s hollow inside! Ellen-chan, what&#x27;d you do with these eggs?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> We took out the insides earlier, with Saaya and Maimai helping me. It&#x27;d be a shame if any of the eggs broke halfway through.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> It was a little hard to do... But it was fun.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Right now, Hiyori-chan is using the insides to cook for us. She&#x27;ll be making a full course meal of egg related dishes for dinner tonight, so look forward to it.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> So Hiyori-chan was in the cooking room-? I wanted to make Easter eggs with her here though...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> I told her the same thing, but she said she&#x27;s better at cooking than painting, so she wanted to be in charge of that...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> So that&#x27;s why.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> It&#x27;s too bad we don&#x27;t have Hiyoyon with us, but let&#x27;s go ahead and get right to painting the eggs! Here&#x27;s pictures of examples for us to use.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Wow, all the eggs look so cute and colorful!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> There&#x27;s a lot of bright, spring-feeling colors, so just looking over them feels exciting.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> What do we do with these eggs after we finish painting them?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> We&#x27;ll all go hide them in the park before tomorrow&#x27;s egg hunt.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Though, with all these flashy designs, won&#x27;t the eggs be found right away?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> There&#x27;s plenty of colorful flowers in the park this time of spring, so they&#x27;ll be harder to find than you think.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Really? Then, I&#x27;ll go with pink, and yellow, and greenish-yellow, and~!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I thought it sounded lively in here. So you&#x27;re all making Easter eggs?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Tsugumi-san! Want to make some together with us?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Thank you for asking. But I&#x27;ve already finished making my own custom made Easter eggs.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I added something to them to make the egg hunt more exciting, so look forward to it.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah, Tsugumi-saaan! ...She already left. I wonder what she did to them.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...I wonder if it&#x27;s okay...  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="easter---kanami-end-in-a-fervor-the-spring-egg-hunt"></a>[Easter - Kanami: End]: In a Fervor!

<strong>Kanami:</strong> Yep! These clothes are so cute it&#x27;s getting me worked up.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I know; the pastel spring colors give them all that cute touch. Though, I never knew there were Easter events you dressed up for.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> I didn&#x27;t either.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> The costumes aren&#x27;t a must, but fancy hats and spring-colored clothes are another way to enjoy Easter.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Kiyoka, Fukki, and Yuiyui worked their hardest to make these.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Wearing these neat clothes and looking for eggs makes me feel like I just stepped into a picture book!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> It&#x27;s about time we got started, but, Hiyoyon isn&#x27;t here, is she?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> I haven&#x27;t seen her all morning. She might&#x27;ve burned out making that full course of eggs yesterday.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> The food last night was incredible too. I guess I&#x27;ll have to work extra hard for Hiyori-chan today! I&#x27;ll find a whole bunch and come in first-!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Everyone, the egg hunt is just about over! Did you get a lot of hunting done?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Totally! That was so fun, like a treasure hunt-.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Yeah, the most important thing is everyone had fun doing it.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Huh? Hiyori-chan, I thought you were taking the day off to rest. You sure have a whole lot of eggs.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Well... I guess I do. So, who&#x27;s the winner of this?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> When everyone gets back, we&#x27;ll count the eggs and decide a winner; though, in the meantime, how about we tidy up?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> It&#x27;d be an issue if we left eggs here in the park, so please check over everywhere you hid them.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Okaaay! Hiyori-chan, let&#x27;s go look together.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Sure.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> It looks like people got to all the eggs that I hid. Maybe where I left them was a little too easy to find. ...Huh?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Nn? Did you find something, Kanami?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> There&#x27;s a ton of ducks under that tree over there. I wonder why?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> You&#x27;re right, it&#x27;s weird to see that many gathered around. But why... Ahhh! The ducks are flocking around easter eggs.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> They&#x27;re all eggs that I left there. I spread them out across multiple locations, but in no time there were ducks gathered around each.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ehh? What, does that mean the ducks were joining in on the egg hunt?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> That&#x27;s about right. Actually, in order to make this event more exciting, I thought, wouldn&#x27;t it be fun if animals were to join in too?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> So I coated the insides of the egg with ingredients giving various scents that animals love. But... I had no idea ducks would be this persistent.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Well, now&#x27;s not the time to get impressed with it. We can&#x27;t leave things like this; we have to hurry up and get those eggs back.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> You&#x27;re right, but we&#x27;re going to have to be brave enough to jump into the middle of all them.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I&#x27;m sorry about this... I know; I have a good idea. I&#x27;ll attract the ducks here using the scents I coated the eggs with, so could you use that chance to get the eggs?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Alright, so you&#x27;ll be the bait. Let&#x27;s go with that.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Come here duckies, over this way. You all love the smell of this...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Okay, the ducks went after Tsugumi. Kanami, get the eggs in the basket while you can!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah. Ummm, one, two, three... Okay, I got them all!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Whoa, I got surrounded by ducks! Save me, Hiyori-chan-!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Mmgh, are you alright, Kanami? Pass the eggs in the basket over here.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Wahh! That duck took one of the eggs! Give it back-!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Hey, don&#x27;t bite my basket! There&#x27;s no eggs in this one.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I wonder what&#x27;s causing that? The ducks seem to be more attracted to the scent on the eggs than what I originally coated them with...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> WAHH!! I got the egg back, but now the pack of ducks are after me-! Hiyori-chan, pass!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Hey, Kanami! Don&#x27;t go throwing eggs! And now the ducks are coming my way.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> The egg hunt turned out far more exciting than I was expecting, from the looks of it.<br>

<strong>Hiyori:</strong> The most I&#x27;ll be able to tell you is to read the textbook and solve the example problems, alright?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> What subject do you need help with, anyway?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> ...Math.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Just memorize the formulas and solve the problems.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> If I could do that, I wouldn&#x27;t be asking you to teach me~!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Probably. But that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m saying. Teaching is out of the question for me.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> ...I guess.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Why don&#x27;t you get someone different to teach you? Like Ellen; aren&#x27;t math and science her strong suits?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ellen-chan and Kaoru-chan are on missions too...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> O-Oh...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Sorry, Hiyori-chan, for asking too much from you. I&#x27;ll study on my own...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ......Sigh, what can I do with you. Give me a minute.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Iwakura-san? This is Juujou... Do you have time right now?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Actually, there&#x27;s a favor I need from you... I need your help on studying.<br>

<strong>Sanae:</strong> Was there something you didn&#x27;t get?<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> Yes, right here! But, please let me think on it a little more for myself.<br>

<strong>Sanae:</strong> (Hasui-san is a hard worker. Maybe the type who moves a little slower than others, but steadily improves on herself.)<br>

Ahh, I&#x27;m beat.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Having to do makeup lessons right after class ends is just mean... That&#x27;s when school&#x27;s supposed to be over.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Fufu. Kanami-chan, Mihono-chan. You&#x27;re working hard.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> But the harder we work on missions, that just means we spend more time in makeup classes. I&#x27;m not really okay with that...!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> They could at least give us a little bit of a break!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I think, even now, they might still be taking into account the rate of missions you&#x27;re sent on for your makeup classes. Especially since you two often get assigned to suppress aradama.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Even still!?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> That&#x27;s too much~...<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Maybe you&#x27;re right. But, if you score well on your tests, I think there&#x27;s a chance you&#x27;d have less makeup classes?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> If you two both try your best, I think you can get even better grades.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Mmm... On tests, huh...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...I think I&#x27;d rather do makeup lessons.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> But, it feels good not having to do any more for a while. After sitting down for so long, I want to get some exercise. So how about doing some swordfighting training after this?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah, if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re doing, then I&#x27;m going with!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> You might not have extra classes, but we have our workplace experience trip tomorrow. Be careful not to overwork yourselves and sleep in too late, alright?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Huh? Our workplace experience was tomorrow? I totally forgot...!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> We&#x27;re in the same group, Kanami-chan, so we have to meet tomorrow morning at 8 at the station. You&#x27;re not allowed to oversleep.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Though, if you&#x27;re not confident, I can go and wake you up tomorrow.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Then... Please, Mai-chan! I&#x27;ll probably be alright, but, just in case!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Sure, I&#x27;ll be there.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Where are you going for tomorrow&#x27;s workplace experience?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> A Japanese style diner. They open starting at noon.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> At a place like that, Mai-chan&#x27;d be a huge help right away!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any way I&#x27;ll be cooking or anything. I think we&#x27;re only serving customers and other simple tasks.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I guess you&#x27;re right.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Where are you supposed to be going, Mihono-chan?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I&#x27;ll be at a kindergarten.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> A kindergarten teacher, hmm. That might be perfect for you, Mihono-chan.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Right? I bet the kids&#x27;ll love her.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Eheheh. You think so? For now, my goal is to play with the kids without letting anybody get hurt!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Give it your best shot tomorrow too, Mihono-chan.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Anyway, let&#x27;s keep tomorrow in mind and do a little training! C&#x27;mon, Mihono-chan!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Sure! You&#x27;re not gonna beat me-.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Me neither!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="hostess---kanami-end-a-little-about-our-future"></a>[Hostess - Kanami: End]: A Little About Our Future<a class="hash-link" href="#hostess---kanami-end-a-little-about-our-future" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah, Mai-chan. The customers at the table in the back want another serving of rice. Big helpings for two people!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Alright. Big helpings.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Oh, there&#x27;s new customers!<br>
<strong>Kanami/Mai:</strong> Welcome~.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I&#x27;ll take you to your seats, so please wait a moment.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Phew... Past 2 o&#x27;clock, you finally start seeing less customers stopping by.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Mmhm. When there was no end in sight at 1:00, I wasn&#x27;t sure what we&#x27;d do, but we somehow made it...<br>
<strong>Customer&#x27;s Voice:</strong> Excuse me-. Could I make an order-?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Yes-. I&#x27;ll be right there.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Kanami-chan, after you&#x27;re finished serving that, the manager said we could take a break.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Got it-.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> All I was doing was taking orders and delivering food, but it still felt pretty hectic.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> It really did. I&#x27;m normally only being served, so I never considered it much, but serving customers was more work than I thought.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> And it was all so new to me, so I was a bit nervous to start.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> It was tough, but the meals they gave us were so tasty.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> After eating that, I felt like I could keep going on and on.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Me too. I can see why customers kept coming in one after another. And also, their uniforms were very cute, with their Japanese taste.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I know what you mean! Wearing something like that was so different, so it was a lot of fun putting it on.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Though, maybe I only felt like that because I was working all day today.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Maybe so.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Have you thought about ever owning a restaurant like that in the future, Mai-chan?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I&#x27;m honestly not sure if I want to try owning a restaurant, but I feel like I have to fight to make sure people working that hard every day can live their lives in peace.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Doing this made me reflect on that all over again.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Good point. It&#x27;s our duty as toji, after all.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> It&#x27;s still a long ways away, but, when I have to stop being a toji, what should I do?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> For you, Kanami-chan, what about teaching at a swordfighting dojo?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I love swordfighting, so that could actually work!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> But, would I really be able to teach all that well?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> It feels like I could teach more if we actually go okatana against okatana, like when my mother was teaching me.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> If you taught someone, I have a feeling they&#x27;d grow into a strong toji.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> And then, after they&#x27;re strong, they can come back and fight their master! That&#x27;d be exciting!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> So, once they got strong enough, you&#x27;d fight your own pupils after all.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Of course I would!  </p><div class="videoWrapper"><iframe width="640" height="480" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m5rpY-umfYk"></iframe></div><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="mahou-shoujo---kanami-start-were-you-going-easy"></a>[Mahou Shoujo - Kanami: Start]: Were You Going Easy?<a class="hash-link" href="#mahou-shoujo---kanami-start-were-you-going-easy" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Are you ready?<br>

<strong>Fate:</strong> You were smiling, Kanami-san.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Eh?<br>
<strong>Fate:</strong> In the middle of our match, you smiled a few times.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah--... Haha, you were just so strong, Fate-chan, I couldn&#x27;t help but smile.<br>
<strong>Fate:</strong> ...I understand.<br>
<strong>Fate:</strong> I don&#x27;t dislike fighting seriously either... Because, when you fight with all you have, your feelings can come across through it.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I know what you mean!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> You feel like you can really understand someone through their sword.<br>

<strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah. Sorry, Fate-chan.<br>

<strong>Kanami:</strong> ...Man, you&#x27;re incredible, Fate-chan.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Kanami, while you were fighting, you were staring at Fate. Why is that?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I was thinking, I might be able to take something away from how Fate-chan moves around.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Like what?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> What sets Fate-chan apart is her speed, right?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> So, if I could capture that with jin&#x27;i, I might be able to borrow what makes Fate-chan so good.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> You&#x27;re right, Kanami. I want to try learning from her too.<br>

<strong>Kanami:</strong> [stare]...<br>
<strong>Fate:</strong> Kanami-san? Sayaka-san?<br>
<strong>Fate:</strong> We still haven&#x27;t finished defeating all of them, so isn&#x27;t it dangerous to be looking away from your opponent?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Y-Yeah, that&#x27;s true! Let&#x27;s get focused, Sayaka-chan!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Alright.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> There&#x27;s no more readings on the spectrum finder, so that should mean our mission&#x27;s done.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm.<br>
<strong>Fate:</strong> So... Why were the both of you watching me, Kanami-san, Sayaka-san?<br>
<strong>Fate:</strong> It was a bit... embarrassing...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ahh, sorry about that, Fate-chan!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I guess you could call it training by observing... We were wondering if we could take something from the way you move around.<br>
<strong>Fate:</strong> So that&#x27;s what it was.<br>

<strong>Hiyori:</strong> They said they sent invitations to everyone in the Five Traditions, so it was bound to be a busy party.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Hey, check out all the food over there. We should get some before the good stuff&#x27;s gone.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Good thinking; we&#x27;d better hurry!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Hey you two, this party&#x27;s meant to be for appreciating the flowers. Isn&#x27;t this exactly what they mean by &quot;dango before flowers&quot;? 	[&quot;Hana yori dango&quot; is a popular Japanese proverb about putting practical things before ornamental things, literally food before flowers]<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> It really is! By the way, Hiyoyon, I saw they have lots of different ice cream over at the dessert corner. And there&#x27;s chocolate mint of course!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Th-There is!? We shouldn&#x27;t just wait around then.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah-- Wait up, Hiyori-chan!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Look how fast she goes.<br>

<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ahh, the food&#x27;s so good; I&#x27;m stuffed! This is the best.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Well, the Origami family are hosting after all. Even the ice cream was very good.<br>

<strong>Mai:</strong> Thank goodness. With all the people here, it was getting hard to find you.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> You were looking for us? What for?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> See, yesterday, after I spoke with my father about the party, he sent over a wonderful present.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> A present? What&#x27;d he send?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Fufu, you&#x27;ll have to see for yourself. There&#x27;s plenty to go around, so do you want to join us in the waiting room?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Sure we do! I can&#x27;t to see what it is.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Th-These are all...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Look at all the lovely party dresses!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Go ahead and put on whichever one you like.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Can we!? Wow; they&#x27;re all so cute, I can&#x27;t pick just one. What about you, Hiyori-chan?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Hmm, it&#x27;s tough narrowing it down. This one&#x27;s nice, but, I don&#x27;t want to let go of this one...<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Oi oi, the party&#x27;s going to be over before you make up your minds.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> But they&#x27;re all too cute to settle on just one-.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> They really are. I can see some that&#x27;d look good on you, Kanami, but nothing I&#x27;d wear...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Same for me; all I keep finding are dresses I think&#x27;d look great on you.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> You two sure think a lot about each other. Why don&#x27;t you just pick out each other&#x27;s dresses then?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> We could do that. What do you think Kanami?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Let&#x27;s go with that! I already found the dress that&#x27;ll look best on you!<br>

<strong>Kanami:</strong> No way. I know you&#x27;ll look amazing in it!<br>

<strong>Hiyori:</strong> F-Fairies...?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> A flower fairy blushing bright red! Nnnn-- I can&#x27;t get enough! This is what spring&#x27;s all about! Spring Has Come!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> H-Hey... Who said you could start taking pictures?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> The model&#x27;s just too cute; my fingers won&#x27;t stop-!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Control yourself, Yamashiro Yui. You&#x27;re being very rude.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Everyone, spring is when perverts start becoming more active. Please be on the lookout. Now, if you&#x27;ll excuse us.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ehh-- Mirja-san, let me go-! You don&#x27;t have to get jealous; you know I love you-!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> She comes and goes like a storm.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> That&#x27;s one way to put it... I hope we can get those pictures from her later.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Sorry about her... I&#x27;ll be sure to ask Yui-chan for you.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Sure, thanks. But, I wasn&#x27;t ready to have my picture taken yet.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> If we&#x27;re going to take pictures, I&#x27;d want a little more time to get mentally ready first.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Then we can take a whole bunch more! There&#x27;s tons of places in here and the courtyard where we could get good photos!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> If you want, I know a great spot nearby to have your photo taken!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Oh, you mean that place with the sparkling pool?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Yeah! The flowers should be blooming there too, and it&#x27;s really close by, so why don&#x27;t you go take your pictures there?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> A sparkling pool? That sounds neat-! Hiyori-chan, let&#x27;s check it out!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Hey, hang on, Kanami! Don&#x27;t run so fast!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Let&#x27;s see, from the map Musumi-san gave me, I think it&#x27;s around here...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Isn&#x27;t this place a wedding chapel? Can we just walk on in?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah! They said it&#x27;s open to the public today. Looks like it&#x27;s right through this door.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Whoa-! Look, Hiyori-chan, look! There&#x27;s a pool right in the middle of the garden!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> I didn&#x27;t think it&#x27;d be like this... There&#x27;s flowers blooming everywhere too; it&#x27;s amazing.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Wahh-! The petals are all blowing around! Now&#x27;s our chance!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> H-Hey! I&#x27;m still not prepared yet...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Sorry, sorry. Hey, let&#x27;s take the next shots in front of the pool where all the petals are floating!<br>

<strong>Mihono:</strong> But... I can&#x27;t just give up all my missions either; what do I do, Mai?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Back then... when Kanami came and helped us out, I knew I should have done whatever it took to bring her back...<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Mm. I know exactly how you feel.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> But, right now, I don&#x27;t think we can do anything but look for her while finishing our missions. There&#x27;s been a few cases where aradama disappeared before toji got there, so maybe...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> You think it could be Kanami doing it!?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I do. So let&#x27;s find out more about it little by little, okay Mihono-chan?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Alright. I think Juujou-san&#x27;s coming up with something too, so we&#x27;ll just have to do what we can.<br>
Having separated herself from everyone, Kanami was now--</p><p><strong>Kanami:</strong> Hmph--! Hah--! Yah--!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Mm. My body really does feel lighter.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> It&#x27;s pretty fun when you can tell all the training you&#x27;re doing&#x27;s paying off.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Wonder if I can use an even higher level of hachimanriki by now. I can use it for longer too.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> And, if I tried putting everything I&#x27;ve got into jin&#x27;i, I could probably go deeper than I&#x27;ve ever gone before.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Though it&#x27;d be pretty bad if I ended up in the netherworld and couldn&#x27;t come back... so I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be trying anytime soon.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> ...!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> There&#x27;s that weird feeling again, like ripples in water. There&#x27;s an aradama close by.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> (Lately, it&#x27;s been like I can see the world around me so clearly. Or maybe, it&#x27;s more like I can feel it?)<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> GGGGIIIII!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah, there really was one here. You can&#x27;t go running wild all over, alright?<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> ...!<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> ...uuu.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> It happened again. Sometimes, when I get close to aradama, they get all quiet and calm down. But why though?<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> When they get like this, even if they&#x27;re aradama, it&#x27;s pretty hard for me to cut them down and exorcise them...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> It doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;s going to be aggressive anymore, so maybe it&#x27;s fine now. It&#x27;s weak enough that spectrum finders probably wouldn&#x27;t pick it up either.<br>
<strong>Toji&#x27;s Voice:</strong> The aradama should be just up ahead.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah-- Somebody&#x27;s here on a mission...! Crap, I&#x27;ve gotta hide...!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...The hell; there&#x27;s no aradama-chan anywhere! You sure this was the right place?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> The coordinates point to right here, but maybe it moved elsewhere... Though, even the spectrum reading&#x27;s disappeared. That&#x27;s odd.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Forget it; I&#x27;m just gonna go find it already!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Please try not running off on your own-. Sorry about her, could you all follow after Shichinosato-san?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> (Sorry everyone...)<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> (You&#x27;ve got a job to do, and it just gets more complicated if you can&#x27;t find the aradama...

<strong>Kanami:</strong> (I get why there&#x27;d be people out there afraid these toji powers could be used on something besides aradama.)<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> (I wouldn&#x27;t have considered it myself, but hearing that sort of made sense.)<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> (If I&#x27;m around, then everyone from them to Akane-sama and Yukari-sama might get caught up in all kinds of trouble.)<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> (--When I kept thinking like that, at some point I just wanted to forget everything and do nothing but swordfighting.)<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I wanted to be free to keep doing this, exorcising aradama and polishing my skills... but I still don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the right thing to do.<br>

<strong>Kanami:</strong> Uh, yeah. I&#x27;m camping there... or something like that.<br>
<strong>Clerk:</strong> Did you ever see anything like a tengu or god of the mountain up there?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Eh!? Is that a thing?<br>
<strong>Clerk:</strong> From what folks say, it&#x27;s thanks to something like that that the aradama round here disappeared.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> (Wait... are they talking about me?)<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> A-Ahaha... I guess that explains it...<br>
<strong>Clerk:</strong> Toji come by here less and less on missions too, so there&#x27;s got to be something to it.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I-I hope I get to see that tengu someday-. Ahaha...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Who&#x27;d have thought they&#x27;d start talking about me like I&#x27;m a tengu...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I got all the tings I need, so I&#x27;ll just stay up here for a while...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Now my usual routine... First to let your mind be one. Cast off the teachings of the art of war, drink of the river Xi... Let nothing be in your heart, and be one with nature...		[Kanami is directly quoting teachings in Yagyu-ryu, signifying becoming one with the world.]<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> And then, 10,000 practice swings...<br>

<strong>Yume:</strong> I wanna try seeing those visions once.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> This isn&#x27;t all fun and games.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Things are alright for now, since none of the toji have been directly hurt yet, but... we have no idea what that aradama is trying to do.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> We need to suppress it as fast as possible.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> That&#x27;s right. Which is why so many toji have been gathered to find it, us included.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Everyone, I&#x27;ve located the aradama. The nearest unit is...<br>
<strong>Illusory Aradama:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> So it showed up for us! We&#x27;re going to start suppressing it!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...Wait, it&#x27;s gone?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> There&#x27;s a good chance it&#x27;s still around here. Let&#x27;s search for... Nn? Where&#x27;s Kanami?<br>
<strong>Illusory Aradama:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Suruga:</strong> You brought yet another in? It&#x27;s impressive how you never tire of this.<br>
<strong>Illusory Aradama:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Suruga:</strong> You do understand? What you show them are no more than illusions.<br>
<strong>Suruga:</strong> However many illusions you show, it will bring you no closer to your objective.<br>
<strong>Illusory Aradama:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Suruga:</strong> Hmph. You shouldn&#x27;t waste the effort; simply kill them. It would be better for you.<br>
<strong>Illusory Aradama:</strong> ...  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="joint-raid-event-14-2-kanamis-disappearance"></a>[Joint Raid Event #14]: 2: Kanami&#x27;s Disappearance<a class="hash-link" href="#joint-raid-event-14-2-kanamis-disappearance" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> Hey, Mai. Did Kanami... message you or anything?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> She didn&#x27;t... I haven&#x27;t heard anything today either.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> She&#x27;s already been gone for a week, hasn&#x27;t she!? Aghh, what if she got in an accident or something...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> If she had, we&#x27;d have heard about it from the bureau.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> But then... did Kanami really run off somewhere by herself?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I think... that&#x27;s pretty likely.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Actually, it seems like there was some kind of proposal from people in the government to monitor and put restrictions on Kanami-chan.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> No way!? Why though!?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Because of her strength... isn&#x27;t that it?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> They gave up on it after Akane-sama and the others pushed back, but there&#x27;s still plenty who think she could be dangerous...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> But, that&#x27;s all messed up. Sure, lately Kanami&#x27;s been really strong, and she totally outplays me a lot, but...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Still, Kanami&#x27;s been protecting everybody this whole time, so I know she&#x27;s not dangerous or anything for anybody.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> That&#x27;s true. I feel the same way. But, if someone has powers... the kind of strength they don&#x27;t understand, there&#x27;s people who would feel afraid of that.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> And that&#x27;s why, Kanami-chan might have...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> She does tend to pick up on things pretty well. So, what happened is... she didn&#x27;t want to cause trouble for the rest of us, so she ran away?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Kanami.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Are you kidding me...! You&#x27;re just going to disappear like that!?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> (Today... what Mai said is probably right. I heard something similar from President Gojou and Origami Yukari.)<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> (But... I get the feeling there&#x27;s more to it, something else that made Kanami leave.)<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> I&#x27;m going to find you and bring you back, Kanami.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> (I won&#x27;t leave you all on your own... So, there&#x27;s something I have to do here.)<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...HAAHH!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> You sure are pushing yourself.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Couldn&#x27;t you at least take a break when you come out here on an expedition?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Knowing you, you&#x27;ve probably been at this every single day the last half a year she&#x27;s been gone.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> I make sure to take breaks. It&#x27;s not going to be an issue.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> I guess I&#x27;ll take your word for it. Though, it&#x27;s pretty important, finding time to relax-. Here, take this.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> This brand of chocomint ice cream; they just started making it. That&#x27;s actually thoughtful of you.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Right? By the way, did you hear from Mihono and Mai? Seems like they ran into Kanami.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> They told me. She came to help when they were struggling with an aradama going wild.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> But then she tried to bail right away, and even though they chased after, there was no way they could keep up.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Just when it&#x27;s been forever since they saw her, she goes and ditches them again; she&#x27;s a real pain in the ass, isn&#x27;t she?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Must have been... her jin&#x27;i. And she&#x27;s got to be able to go very deep with it by now.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Well, that&#x27;s how she is, Hiyori. You&#x27;ve gotta take care of her for us.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Anyway, I&#x27;m going to bed. Don&#x27;t go staying up too late, alright-.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...Sure.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> (I have this feeling... If I can cross okatana with her, I&#x27;ll understand what&#x27;s going through Kanami&#x27;s head.)<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> (I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get this across too. How badly I-- How much everyone wants you back with them.)<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> (And when I beat you, I&#x27;m dragging you right back here.)  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="joint-raid-event-14-3-even-if-you-reach-even-greater-heights"></a>[Joint Raid Event #14]: 3: Even if You Reach Even Greater Heights<a class="hash-link" href="#joint-raid-event-14-3-even-if-you-reach-even-greater-heights" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> I see. So you&#x27;re saying, on the mountain up ahead, whenever people encounter aradama, they disappear right after.<br>
<strong>Local Resident:</strong> Well, it&#x27;s been happening for about a year now I think. We thought maybe it was a toji helping us, but we never saw sight of one.<br>
<strong>Local Resident:</strong> It&#x27;s happened so many times now that folks are saying there might really be a god of the mountain up there.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Thanks a lot for telling me all this. I&#x27;ll try looking into it.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> (Exorcising aradama in an instant and never letting anyone see her; who else would be pulling that off?)<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Just a little longer, Kanami.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Found you. ...Seeing you still just swordfighting even out here; in a way, it&#x27;s actually a relief.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> (Kanami... It&#x27;s been a while since I saw her, but she definitely feels different from before. Like there&#x27;s an air of purity to her.)<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Hiyori-chan...!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> (Though even with that, she&#x27;s still Kanami.)<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> You&#x27;re going to be coming back with me.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> So that&#x27;s why. Alright then.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Let&#x27;s go!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Hahh~... You really are strong, Hiyori-chan... It&#x27;s sorta hard dealing that &quot;hitotsu no tachi&quot; of yours.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Does that mean you&#x27;re admitting I beat you?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Hmm. Sure, you beat me this time. You&#x27;re even faster than I was imagining you&#x27;d be!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Well, I spent as much time as I could to show you just how strong I can be.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> (Though, I don&#x27;t know how serious Kanami was about our fight just now...)<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> (The way she&#x27;s gotten, if she used kongoushin or went all out with jin&#x27;i, could she have defended against me?)<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Hehe, that makes me kinda happy...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> &quot;Kinda happy&quot;-- That&#x27;s all you have to say? Honestly... Don&#x27;t go running off to be all alone again, you idiot.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Mm, thanks.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> If I said all the things I wanted to, we&#x27;d be here all day. We&#x27;re going home. Everyone&#x27;s waiting.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I think this is the first time took me by the hand like this, isn&#x27;t it?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> There&#x27;s no way that&#x27;s true. Probably.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> That day when we first fought each other, back at the tournament. I was the one who grabbed your hand and we ran away together. Now it&#x27;s totally the other way around.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> And just like back then, I&#x27;m still always the one getting swept up in whatever you do.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Hey, Hiyori-chan. I don&#x27;t think... I&#x27;ll ever be able to give up on training with the sword.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> What&#x27;s wrong with that? I couldn&#x27;t imagine you giving up swordfighting anyway.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> And besides, it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m planning on giving up training anytime soon either.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> ...Yeah!
