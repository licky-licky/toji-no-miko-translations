Writing up a report after every single mission is getting to be a real chore.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Be thankful we have a computer database now. The way things were organized several years ago was much worse.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Worse than this, huh... Just imagining it gives me chills.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Can I help?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> You can help by not helping. You&#x27;re just going to end up giving us more work here.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Hey, Maki onee-san! That was mean!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> But it&#x27;s the truth. There&#x27;s no other way I can break it to you. Besides, you&#x27;re just looking to use this as an excuse to stay up late, aren&#x27;t you? Go to bed, Yume.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> First you treat me like I&#x27;m a nuisance, and now you treat me like a kid! You really are mean!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> We should take a break here, everyone. I made you all some black tea.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Ara, thank you very much, Yomi-san.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Sure, we could use some rest.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> You&#x27;re so thoughtful, Yomi onee-san! I&#x27;ll have some! ...Ughgh!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Th-This stuff... Smells like that stomach medicine I had to take... Is this poisoned...?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...I-It has a somewhat distinct, unique flavor for black tea, doesn&#x27;t it?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes, it&#x27;s known as lapsang souchong. The leaves are smoke dried over pinewood fires, adding a rich aroma to it.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Nearly all production of lapsang souchong happens in Great Britain, making it very rare to find in Japan. I was lucky to obtain this today.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Black tea itself is said to have been first invented when military forces were transporting Chinese tea leaves, which fermented and became black tea. Though, of course, there are many theories as to its origin.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> When making this kind of tea, you must always use hard water. On top of that, if you don&#x27;t manage the temperature of the water carefully, the aroma will be lost.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> .........<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> ............<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ......? Is something wrong?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> No, it&#x27;s just, I&#x27;ve never heard you talk that much before...<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I was only answering her question. I do like black tea.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Is that so? Yomi-san, I&#x27;d be happy if you could speak this freely more often, at least between the four of us.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Eh... Y-Yes. I... I&#x27;ll keep that in mind.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> And thanks for making us tea, Yomi. It was a good change of pace.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I see. I&#x27;m glad you liked the lapsang souchong.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Nobody said they liked the tea though...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> What&#x27;s wrong, Yume? You hardly drank yours.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> ...Eh? Ahh, I was just thinking, the caffeine will make it harder to sleep... Right! S-So I&#x27;m going to bed!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Nice work, Yomi. You put Yume to bed in a flash. Ahaha.<br>

Thanks to that, we received an emergency dispatch.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Well I&#x27;ve been waiting for something like this!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Then let&#x27;s get to work, everyone.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes, I&#x27;ll follow your lead.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Sigh... Do we really have to write reports immediately after a night mission...?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Even as you say that, you&#x27;re still faithfully compiling them. I like that about you, Maki-san.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Nn... I bet what you really like is seeing me suffer through this, isn&#x27;t it.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Ara, don&#x27;t be rude. All the help I&#x27;ve given you here should prove otherwise.<br>
<em>Yume starts poking around</em></p><p><strong>Maki:</strong> Oi, Yume. If you have nothing better to do, then go to bed.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Now you&#x27;re being mean~! I was just waiting to see if you needed help with anything!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Or because you&#x27;re too excited after fighting and now you can&#x27;t sleep. That&#x27;s the problem with ki-...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ah~! And now you&#x27;re treating me like a kid again! Right!? Suzuka onee-san! Maki onee-san was about to say kids, wasn&#x27;t she!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Excuse me...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> A-Ara, Yomi! Did you bring us tea?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes. To clear your tension after sortieing, I prepared a chamomile blend tonight.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> ...Nnnn? Yomi onee-san, something smells kinda like its burnt. Did you shower after we came back?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> That&#x27;s... Um, these...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> You baked cookies too? Hooray! You gotta have cookies with tea, after all! ......Wait, these are burnt black...<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> My apologies; I haven&#x27;t gotten used to cooking yet. Ahh, so &#x27;mbarrisin.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Huh?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> What was that, Yomi?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> &#x27;Mbarrisin?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Ah... Sorry you had to hear that. That&#x27;s how we say we&#x27;re embarrassed in the Akita dialect.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Kyahahaha! &#x27;Mbarrisin! That&#x27;s so weird-!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Yume!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Don&#x27;t be disrespectful to the way others speak.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Yomi, don&#x27;t worry about it now. ...But when we&#x27;re on a mission, I need you to be more careful with your words.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> If we can&#x27;t quickly and clearly understand you, in the worst case scenario, someone could lose their life. You wouldn&#x27;t want that either, right?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Right. I&#x27;ll bear that in mind from now on.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...Yomi. Moreover, these cookies. They didn&#x27;t actually turn out that badly.<br>

I found it~! I found it~! I know what Yomi onee-san&#x27;s scared of~!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Yomi onee-san&#x27;s from Akita, so she should be scared of the &quot;Namahage&quot;.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Apparently a lot of people from Akita have some kind of childhood trauma about it.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> But she&#x27;s older now, so is it still gonna scare her? I&#x27;ll just have to do a little test.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I&#x27;ll hide here where Yomi onee-san should be passing by...<br>

<strong>Yume:</strong> Eh, uh, nothing. Well, umm...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I just heard somewhere that Yomi onee-san was scared of the Namahage, so uh, I was just wondering how scared she&#x27;d be, and...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Yomi&#x27;s unconscious!? Oi, Yomi! Yomi! Wake up! Pull yourself together! Yume! What did you do!?<br>

<strong>Yume:</strong> Oh? What&#x27;re you eating, Yomi onee-san?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Omusubi.ã€€(munch munch...)<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Onigiri? [both are rice balls]<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> This isn&#x27;t onigiri. It&#x27;s omusubi. (munch munch...)<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Same difference. You&#x27;re pretty picky.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Would you like one too, Tsubakuro-san? (munch munch...)<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I&#x27;m not really that hungry, but what else is in that onigiri?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Only salt. (munch munch...)<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Huhh? Who eats onigiri with just salt, not even a seaweed wrap?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I do. (munch munch...) When you wrap it in seaweed or add other ingredients, it becomes harder to appreciate the flavor of the rice.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Omusubi is simply rice and salt. That&#x27;s the best.  (munch munch...)<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Huh... Well I guess you don&#x27;t need anything else if the rice tastes good enough.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes. (munch munch...) With delicious enough rice, rice alone is enough of a meal.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> And rice itself is the greatest energy food. As you chew it, the starch is broken down and absorbed as sugars, which are very good for you.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Particularly brown rice, which is unparalleled as the world&#x27;s perfect food. Eating white rice blended with brown rice will provide you in abundance all the nutrition needed to maintain a healthy body.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> By the way, Tsubakuro-san. You called these onigiri, but in fact the ones formed in a triangular shape are actually omusubi. That shape is meant to mimic that of a mountain.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Water is vital to making rice. Supposedly, it&#x27;s intended to show respect to the mountains from which rivers flow. (munch munch munch...)<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> O-Okay...<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Tsubakuro-san, would you like some omusubi as well? I&#x27;ll share half of them with you. They&#x27;re made from the delicious rice of Akita, where I was born.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Eh... I-I&#x27;m good for now. I&#x27;m not that hungry. Ahaha, I&#x27;ll see you later-!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> (I think she had something like 20 of them there!? Who could eat even 10 onigiri with just salt-!? No way! I couldn&#x27;t even eat 10 onigiri period!)<br>
<em>Yume runs off</em></p><p><strong>Yomi:</strong> But they&#x27;re so delicious. (munch munch munch...)<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Though, I did make too many. I&#x27;ll eat one more. The rest can be saved for a snack, dinner, a late night snack, tomorrow&#x27;s breakfast, and then lunch.

<strong>Yume:</strong> I don&#x27;t want to wear a wedding dress then! You wear it, Yomi-onee-san!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Weren&#x27;t you looking forward to wearing it?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I was, but... If I don&#x27;t fight, then I can&#x27;t show off my good side.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ...Understood.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> We will switch off acting as the decoy, so I will have a wedding dress prepared for me as well.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Hey hey? Is it okay if I take a picture of you wearing your dress, Yomi-onee-san?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ...What would you need that for?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> To remember the occasion! We might not get to do this again, so I want to show everyone!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ...Eh? Everyone...?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Maki-onee-san and Suzuka-onee-san and Yukari-sama!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Th-That would be...<br>

<strong>Yume:</strong> ...Wow! You look super pretty, Yomi-onee-san!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> D-Do you think so? It doesn&#x27;t feel right on me...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> No way! You&#x27;re like a real bride!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ...Th-Thank you very much. Hopefully the aradama thinks I am a real bride too...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> What do you want to do until the aradama shows up? Should we walk around?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> First, we should wait here.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> If it doesn&#x27;t come... Then we can walk around a little.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Hey hey, while we wait for the aradama, I can take some pictures, right?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ...Please don&#x27;t point your phone at me.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> There&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m passing up something this fun. Give me a smile!<br>

<strong>Yume:</strong> C&#x27;mon-! You have to smile!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I thought I was smiling...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> You&#x27;re not smiling at all. Like, say cheese!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Ch-Cheese?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Hmm, you still aren&#x27;t smiling right.<br>

<strong>Yomi:</strong> Ah!? Tsubakuro-san! The aradama!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Oh, you&#x27;re right. HAAAA!!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Huh, that was nothing.<br>

<strong>Yomi:</strong> ...Please, bring out the next one.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> We&#x27;re going through them at a good pace. You&#x27;ve been working hard, Satsuki-san. Let&#x27;s take a quick break.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ...I do not need a break.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Hmmm, considering the margins for safety, I&#x27;d prefer if you were rested though.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> The next aradama to appear will be more powerful, so it could be difficult if you aren&#x27;t in peak condition.<br>

<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> In that case, I&#x27;ll send out the next one.<br>

<strong>Bull Type Aradama:</strong> ROAAAAAAAAR!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Hya...<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Satsuki-san?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Ah......<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Satsuki-san!? What&#x27;s wrong, Satsuki-san!!<br>
<strong>Bull Type Aradama:</strong> GAAAAAAAAAA!!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> AAAAUGH!!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ...Where am I? I remember, I was in the laboratory...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ah, you&#x27;re awake, Yomi-onee-san.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes... Good morning, Tsubakuro-san.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Now&#x27;s not the time to be saying, &quot;Good morning&quot;!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I was getting worried that you weren&#x27;t going to wake up, you know?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> You&#x27;re right... It seems I wasn&#x27;t thinking straight.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I thought I was at Ban-san&#x27;s lab, but now...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I was worried, so I had them bring you here. I&#x27;m not supposed to leave here since I&#x27;m on duty.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ...Is that so. Thank you, Tsubakuro-san.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> You don&#x27;t have to thank me.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Anyway, were the aradama at that researcher onee-san&#x27;s place that strong? I thought she didn&#x27;t have anything but weaklings.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> That&#x27;s right. It was an ordinary aradama.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Why&#x27;d you get hurt then?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> That&#x27;s because... It&#x27;s somewhat of a long story. Do you want to hear it?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Yeah! Tell me all about it!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> It happened when I was in elementary school... I was involved in an aradama incident.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="ceremonial-dress---misogi-end-to-one-day-repay-her"></a>[Ceremonial Dress - Misogi: End]: To One Day Repay Her<a class="hash-link" href="#ceremonial-dress---misogi-end-to-one-day-repay-her" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Yomi:</strong> It happened when I was in elementary school... I was involved in an aradama incident.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Was it something like... The aradama back then was the same kind as the one at the lab?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ...How did you know that?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Anybody could figure that out. There&#x27;s nothing else it could be.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ...I see. In that case, there&#x27;s no need for me to explain the rest.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh, I wanna hear more about what you were like when you were younger, Yomi-onee-san!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> What were you like back then?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> What was I like...? A normal elementary school student. I was a normal girl.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> There&#x27;s gotta be something more, right?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ...There was nothing special about me. I was normal.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Anyway, the incident involved a bull type aradama appearing on the main road... Several vehicles had been totaled.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I was also nearly crushed by it.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> That&#x27;s like something out of a monster movie.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes, I felt that I would die there. However... Moments later, a platoon of toji from Renpu arrived, and I was safely rescued.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Right in the nick of time! Do you know any of the girls who saved you?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ...I only learned this later on, but the one directing that platoon was President Takatsu.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Really!?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes. I want to repay her for that someday.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Repay her? Like how? By beating more aradama?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ...Something like that.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Since that incident, I had never faced another bull type aradama... But it seems my body still remembers the fear it felt then.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Hmmm. In that case, you should chop up that bull aradama.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ...What?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> You&#x27;re only scared cause it beat you! So, won&#x27;t you be fine after you kill one?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ...Will I?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> No... You&#x27;re right, if possible, I would like to overcome it one day...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Since you agree with me, let&#x27;s go to the lab!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ...Eh?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Onee-san, get a bull type aradama ready for us-!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Tsubakuro-san, and... I see you&#x27;re up and about again, Satsuki-san.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I&#x27;m sorry to have made you worry.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> No no, it wasn&#x27;t your fault.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Anyway, a bull type aradama? I can have it ready in a moment, so are you ready to fight, Tsubakuro-san?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> What do you mean? I&#x27;m not the one fighting it; Yomi-onee-san is.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Satsuki-san... Will fight it?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Tsubakuro-san, if I see that aradama again, it&#x27;s likely my body will freeze up once more.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I know that; the whole reason we&#x27;re here is to help you beat that.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Don&#x27;t worry about anything. If it looks like you&#x27;re in trouble, I&#x27;ll chop up that aradama for you.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Then you&#x27;ll get used to it after a while, right?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Well, in that case... I suppose there would be no danger.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> (I think my mental state will be in danger however...)<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ...I understand.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> It would cause problems if I were unable to act in the field, so please help me, Tsubakuro-san.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> You got it!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Then... Ban-san, please begin. I&#x27;m going to accustom myself to fighting the bull type aradama.<br>
<strong>Bull Type Aradama:</strong> ROAAAAAAAR!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ...!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Way to go, Yomi-onee-san! You dodged its attack!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ...It seems I&#x27;m growing used to my fear.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Think you can beat it?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I&#x27;ll try, but...!?<br>
<strong>Bull Type Aradama:</strong> GUUUOOOOO!!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> (...I&#x27;m scared. My body won&#x27;t stop shaking... This fear won&#x27;t be erased so easily after all...)<br>

<strong>Bull Type Aradama:</strong> OOUUUUUUU!!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Yomi-onee-san!?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> (If I lose focus, I could be crushed... However, as I am now, I can stop these attacks...)<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> [Inhale... Exhale...]<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ...HAA!<br>

<strong>Yume:</strong> Eh... Wah!?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> The crowd&#x27;s thick. If you don&#x27;t look where you&#x27;re going, you&#x27;ll bump into someone.<br>

<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Business is booming. What could it be for?<br>
<strong>Stall Managing Toji:</strong> Ah, the elite guard, with Yukari-sama...! This line is for our yakisoba.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> ...!<br>
<strong>Stall Managing Toji:</strong> Yakisoba seemed popular at festivals in the past, so we tried copying that, but this was more than I imagined...<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> I see.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Yukari-sama... If you&#x27;d like some, I could stand in line for you?<br>
<strong>Stall Managing Toji:</strong> Yukari-sama herself... Wants to try our yakisoba!?<br>
<strong>Stall Managing Toji:</strong> I-I&#x27;ll bring you some straight away...!<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> ...No, stop. The two of you needn&#x27;t concern yourselves with me.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> With all these people in line, I shouldn&#x27;t be the only one to receive special treatment.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Yomi, you have your duty to patrol and observe the area. As for the yakisoba... That&#x27;s right. If any is left over, I will have some then.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> As you wish.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Don&#x27;t let it bother you. Now then, we&#x27;ll look around elsewhere. We have to ensure no one is hurt or in trouble.<br>
<strong>Stall Managing Toji:</strong> ...Y-Yes ma&#x27;am!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Is Yukari-sama okay with that-? With how long that line is, won&#x27;t they run out quick for sure?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> If Yukari-sama insists, we shouldn&#x27;t object any further.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh, but she looked like she wanted to have some-.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> We&#x27;re going, you two. We can&#x27;t allow Yukari-sama to go on ahead by herself.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> We can&#x27;t afford to get lost either. Will you take my hand, Tsubakuro-san?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Guess I don&#x27;t have a choice, huh~. We&#x27;d be in a lot of trouble if you got lost, Yomi-onee-san.<br>

Hey hey, what is this?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I&#x27;m not quite sure what all these balls are for...<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> They&#x27;re for super ball scooping.<br>
<strong>Yume/Suzuka:</strong> ...Super ball?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Why are they super?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Their repulsive force is super. If you throw them against the wall or floor, they bounce off with great force. And also, the rugby ball shaped ones bounce unpredictably.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> They sound fun! I want some! I can try scooping them, can&#x27;t I?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Fine by me; go ahead.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I&#x27;ll get a whole lot, so I&#x27;ll give you some too, Suzuka-onee-san!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Good. I&#x27;ll look forward to it.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Allow me to offer some advice before you attempt it. It&#x27;s a common misconception, but it&#x27;s actually harder for the scoop to be broken if you let it fully soak in the water.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Wait, really!?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> If only a part of it is wet, it will break more easily. Also, I suggest not aiming for larger ones and many at once.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Thanks for the tips, Yomi-onee-san.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> You did it, Tsubakuro-san.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Wasn&#x27;t it way easier than the goldfish though, cause they aren&#x27;t moving around on their own-?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Wait, where&#x27;s Suzuka-onee-san and Maki-onee-san?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Over there, eating shaved ice.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> You can&#x27;t go to a summer festival without trying this.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Strawberry, melon, lemon, blue hawaii... They had so many choices that I couldn&#x27;t make my mind up.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> You went with blue hawaii, didn&#x27;t you?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I couldn&#x27;t imagine how it would taste. I only chose it on your recommendation. It&#x27;s sweet and rather good.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> The only downside is it turns your tongue blue.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Fufu, and what&#x27;s wrong with that? I find that sort of thing funny.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I had a feeling you&#x27;d say something like that.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Hey...!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ah! Lucky-. We should get some shaved ice too!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I agree. What flavor would you like, Tsubakuro-san?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Strawberry!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Understood. I&#x27;ll go buy it, so please wait here for a moment.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I&#x27;ll just go with you!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> That reminds me, earlier, I saw an Ichigo Daifuku Neko mask in one of the stalls.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Wait, you did!?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Should we go buy that first?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> ...Isn&#x27;t wearing masks sort of for kids-? I do like Ichigo Daifuku Neko though.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Do you think so? I think it would be cute if you wore it, Tsubakuro-san.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> W-Well... If you say so, Yomi-onee-san, then maybe we can go look around for it a little, after we get shaved ice.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I think that&#x27;s a good idea.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Festivals sure are fun, huh.<br>

Here, over here~.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I could tell where you were without you having to shout.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> You just looked like you were kinda spacing out over there. Anyway, ready to go?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I was wondering where you were taking me. A cakery?<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> What&#x27;s wrong with that? The limited run parfaits this place makes get a lot of talk for being good.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> You still like parfaits like you used to.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> So, what was the reason you called me here for?<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> I had a little something to take care of around here. So I thought I&#x27;d give you a call. It&#x27;s no fun eating by yourself, right?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> I know you&#x27;ve probably got a lot going on too, but you&#x27;ve gotta take a breather every now and then.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I have to be part of a promotional photo shoot later today, so I can&#x27;t stay here for very long.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Huhh? What&#x27;re you doing a photo shoot for?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> You could say it has to do with the results of the Miss Five Traditions competition that was held the other day, I suppose.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Ahh, oh yeah, they put those out, huh.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> That reminds me, didn&#x27;t you place pretty high yourself? I was surprised to hear it. I never thought you&#x27;d be up there.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Though, it must be boring as hell to sit through some photo shoot cause of it.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I can&#x27;t neglect this, considering it&#x27;s part of my duties as a toji.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> You got so straight laced. But, if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re set on. You better do it right.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> You gonna be doing it in your uniform? They&#x27;d probably get mad if you wore something too casual; so a jacket like mine&#x27;s out.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> You&#x27;re probably right. Though, this time it&#x27;s arranged for me to wear a valkyrie themed costume, along with Tsubakuro-san and the others.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> What&#x27;re you talking about?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> You may not know about it, Akira, but valkyries were something that was part of Norse mythology--<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> It&#x27;s not like I don&#x27;t know what valkyries are...! I&#x27;m asking, why&#x27;re they making you dress up like that...!?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> That&#x27;s what I&#x27;d like to know.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Yeah, I guess... The bureau does say to do some ridiculous stuff sometimes, huh.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> ...Well, do what you can. Whatever you&#x27;re buying here&#x27;ll be my treat.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Then, I&#x27;ll have some tea. The black tea here is fairly good; it goes well with sweet foods.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> I&#x27;ll have the same thing you&#x27;re drinking then.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Ah, when you get the photos back, lemme see.

<strong>Yomi:</strong> I got the photos back from that photo shoot we spoke about the other day.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I think they&#x27;ll be published online soon, but I had heard you were coming by on an assignment.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Cool; let me just put my bike away. Wait here a minute.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> So, how&#x27;d that photo shoot turn out anyway?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Like this.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Whoa-!? The hell... You&#x27;re looking way too cool in this.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> That sharp look on your face is great. It came out really damn nice.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I didn&#x27;t expect you to praise it so much.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Why not? Of course I would if it turned out this good.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> That&#x27;s true. Though, I expected you to make fun of me.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Yeah, if I&#x27;m being honest, I was planning to, until I actually saw this. This whole valkyrie thing came out of nowhere.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> But this seems like it&#x27;ll get some attention. Especially if Tsubakuro Yume and Kanami and the others are doing it.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> You got any other shots of you in this?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> No. This is the only one I brought with me.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> That&#x27;s too bad. I really like the look of this one.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I see. I wasn&#x27;t sure which photo to bring myself, so the others in the special defense team picked it out for me.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Huh. Didn&#x27;t think you were so close with them, Yomi.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Does that mean you&#x27;re pushing omusubi on them too?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Sometimes... I do.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> The omusubi you make are weirdly good, y&#x27;know. Somehow, just talking about them made me hungry.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> I&#x27;m thinking of getting something to eat here, but, what about you?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I&#x27;d like to join you, but I&#x27;ve already made plans.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> With the special defense team?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Guess there&#x27;s no helping that. We didn&#x27;t get to see each other much, but I had fun today.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I did too. Then, until next time.<br>

<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yes, all toji from the Five Traditions are gathering for a big occasion, and of course, we of the elite guard have been invited as well.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I see. I have some business I want to take care of before the end of the year, so please go without me.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Well, we can&#x27;t do that. Since it&#x27;s a big party, we got permission from Yukari-sama, saying we should all go.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> And Yume seems to be trying her best at getting something ready. It would be terrible if you weren&#x27;t there.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Is that right... Then, I suppose I&#x27;ll have to go. Is there anything I need to prepare in advance?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> It said on the invitation they&#x27;re doing a gift exchange at the end of the party, so everybody needs to have one gift ready.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> With all the people that should be there, an exchange should be exciting. I should get mine ready straight away~.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Wait up, Suzuka! I want your advice on what to go with. I&#x27;m coming with you!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> The two of them left. Sigh... A gift exchange...<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> A gift which you can&#x27;t anticipate who will be receiving it... That&#x27;s a fairly difficult request.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> A present that would make anyone happy... Something that, no matter how many people got it, they would be happy with... Like, for example, delicious white rice...<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Ah-! That&#x27;s what I could do.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I&#x27;ve reached a stopping point in my duties, so I&#x27;ll quickly go out to do some shopping.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I may have bought a bit too much, but I suppose I&#x27;ll get right to cooking. It&#x27;s a good thing the kitchen was available.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Wow! Yomiyomi! I don&#x27;t often run into you in a place like this~!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Are we maybe getting in your way?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> No, it&#x27;s fine so long as I can use the faucet and stove. You can use the next counter over if it&#x27;s fine with you.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Thanks for that then! Though, you sure have a lot of rice. And a nice big pot.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Are you getting ready for the Christmas party or something?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes, they said we would need something for the gift exchange, so I was thinking of using a type of rice that tastes delicious when cold to make omusubi.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Wow! Now that&#x27;s a coincidence~! Kiyoka and I were here to make sweets for the present exchange too.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I&#x27;m baking cookies, and Ellen-san was going to make muffins.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I see, sweets are a standard gift for schoolgirls. You do often see them decorated for Christmas on sale around town.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> To give omusubi as a Christmas present... Maybe what I&#x27;m making will be out of place.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That&#x27;s not true at all! Even with onigiri, depending on how you decorate them, they can definitely be cute Christmas presents!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> That&#x27;s right~! Christmas style onigiri! If I got something like that, I&#x27;d be extra happy!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Um, if it&#x27;s alright, could we help you make them? We&#x27;ll make a Christmas style onigiri bento!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Definitely~! I&#x27;ll help with Yomiyomi&#x27;s onigiri bento too!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Musumi-san, Kohagura-san, thank you both. I appreciate you wanting to help. However, what I want to make is not onigiri bento.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka/Ellen:</strong> Eh?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> It&#x27;s omusubi bento.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="xmas-19---yomi-end-the-fun-of-giving"></a>[Xmas&#x27; 19 - Yomi: End]: The Fun of Giving<a class="hash-link" href="#xmas-19---yomi-end-the-fun-of-giving" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Still though, Christmas style onigi... Ah-! Omusubi! How do you think those should look?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> For cakes, something called a Buche de Noel is popular. It&#x27;s a roll cake decorated to look like a log of wood.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I see, a log of wood... If it were a sushi roll, I could make it look that way.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It wouldn&#x27;t be very Christmas-like though, would it.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Since it&#x27;s difficult expressing Christmas through the shape...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I know! For Christmas onigi... Ah-! Omusubi! What about this? You could bring out the feeling with red and green ingredients.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Red and green... In that case, I have umeboshi and shiyazuke for red, and shiso leaves for green.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Both of those would go perfect with onigi... Rice balls!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That was a nice save, Ellen-san.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Thank you both. With your suggestions, I should be able to make these omusubi feel like Christmas.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I&#x27;m glad we could help. Then, Ellen-san, we should get to making our own sweets now.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> You&#x27;re right. Though, Kiyoka, you sure have a lot of shapes for cutting cookies.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> There&#x27;s Santa Claus, reindeers, stars. They all feel like Christmas!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> They&#x27;re all so cute, so I couldn&#x27;t help but bring them out... Ah, I know! Satsuki-san, I came up with something good!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Something good?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> If you use my cookie cutters, and cut out a bit of omelette...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Wow! That&#x27;s a pretty Christmas star! If you put that with Yomiyomi&#x27;s rice balls...!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> It looks beautiful... Like a Christmas tree inside the bento box.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It really is! It turned out cuter than I thought!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Whoever gets this lunch box during the gift exchance will be very happy!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Yeah! I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll be happy with it! I&#x27;m looking forward to tomorrow.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Thank you very much. Now I won&#x27;t feel uncomfortable joining the party. Then, I&#x27;ll be leaving now.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Please wait a minute! Since we&#x27;re exchanging gifts, it&#x27;d be a waste to leave it at that!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> For the exchange, you can&#x27;t not wrap it up all cute~.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> You do have a lot of ribbons and wrapping paper.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Maybe it would be cuter with a gap between the inside and outside! What do you think about this ribbon? Ah, or this one might be cute too!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> You always do have an awesome eye for design, Kiyoka~. Which do you like, Yomiyomi?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I... think both are fine. I&#x27;ll go with whatever you choose.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Alright then! If we tie this ribbon on, it&#x27;s ready!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> My omusubi became such a cute present... Musumi-san, Kohagura-san, I can&#x27;t thank you enough.<br>
The day of the Christmas Eve party.</p><p><strong>Mirja:</strong> Now then, for the final event of the party, all who joined us will be exchanging gifts. Everyone, do you all have your presents ready?<br>
<strong>Kanami/Mai/Yume:</strong> We dooo!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> What&#x27;s the matter, Satsuki-san? The gift exchange is starting.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Musumi-san. Everyone seems to have brought such proper gifts, so are omusubi really alright...?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It&#x27;ll be fine. I know for sure someone will be glad to get it. Aren&#x27;t you excited to see the happy look on their face when they open it?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> The face they make... I hadn&#x27;t thought about it, but you&#x27;re right. I am a little interested.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Yomiyomi, Kiyoka! They&#x27;re starting the gift exchange. Let&#x27;s go over!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Alright.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> (The happy face of the person who receives it... That&#x27;s the fun of giving presents, isn&#x27;t it...)  </p><div class="videoWrapper"><iframe width="640" height="480" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UDpu_4zvXrw"></iframe></div><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="journey-to-the-west---yomi-start-what-is-tsubakuro-san-going-to-do"></a>[Journey to the West - Yomi: Start]: What Is Tsubakuro-san Going to Do?<a class="hash-link" href="#journey-to-the-west---yomi-start-what-is-tsubakuro-san-going-to-do" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Yukari:</strong> Satsuki. Konohana will be joining me at this evening&#x27;s conference. I won&#x27;t be needing an escort. You&#x27;ll be assisting Shidou instead.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Understood.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Maki-san. If there&#x27;s an urgent request for aid, please do all you can.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Sure, you can count on us.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> We&#x27;ll be going then.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Huh-? Did Yukari-sama and Suzuka-onee-san go out somewhere?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> They just left for a conference.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh, but I thought I&#x27;d get Yukari-sama to play with me. It feels like you onee-sans have been really busy lately.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Apart from our aradama suppression missions, there&#x27;s always something to take care of.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> But because of that, we haven&#x27;t gotten to play at all. Or, actually, haven&#x27;t we barely been able to get the four of us together lately?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> You&#x27;re right. The rate of aradama appearances isn&#x27;t dropping at all though. There&#x27;s too much work needing toji to do it.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> If it&#x27;s aradama, then I can beat as many as I have to!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> It&#x27;s reassuring to have you, Tsubakuro-san, but you can&#x27;t respond to aradama appearing in multiple locations at once.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Looking at the whole picture, even if you are very active, it won&#x27;t reduce the overall work of toji that much.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Mmgh.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Though, I get what Yume&#x27;s saying. But it&#x27;s hard getting all of us time off at the same time.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Then, it&#x27;d be fine if it&#x27;s not when we have time off?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ...What do you mean?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> You&#x27;ll find out later~.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> There&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve gotta go do real quick.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> What do you think she&#x27;s up to?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> No idea... But, it&#x27;s always a bit scary when Yume gets an idea.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Hey hey, Onee-san. There&#x27;s a little something I want you do to for me, okay?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> If it&#x27;s something I can manage, then I don&#x27;t mind.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Y&#x27;see--<br>
A few days later.</p><p><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I recieved a message from Yume earlier, but do you know what this is about, Yomi-san?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> No. I only know that, several days ago, she seemed to be planning something.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Well, we&#x27;re lucky to be spending some time together, though it&#x27;s only for a few hours.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> That&#x27;s true. I&#x27;m slightly looking forward to it.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="journey-to-the-west---yomi-end-it-might-be-nice-to-continue-our-journey"></a>[Journey to the West - Yomi: End]: It Might Be Nice to Continue Our Journey<a class="hash-link" href="#journey-to-the-west---yomi-end-it-might-be-nice-to-continue-our-journey" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Maki:</strong> Hey... Yomi. What are we doing here, anyway...<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> What are you saying now, Pigsy? I&#x27;m Sandy. And we have to defeat these bandits to rescue our master.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Didn&#x27;t think you&#x27;d get so into this... Uh, Sandy.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> That was a joke.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect when Tsubakuro-san invited us for training, but I didn&#x27;t imagine we would be using the VR facilities.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I&#x27;m still not completely used to this whole VR thing... But it&#x27;s useful if you think of this as time spent strengthening the SDDT&#x27;s coordination.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Though, did it really need to be done up like Journey to the West...?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> This training program seems to be popular. And also, I think Tsubakuro-san is fitting for the role of the Monkey King.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> The Monkey King&#x27;s wild and uncontrollable side might be a good fit for her. Though, I&#x27;m not that on board with me being Pigsy...<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Is it bothering you? I didn&#x27;t think you&#x27;d mind. I&#x27;ve heard that Pigsy is a popular character in China.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Is he really?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> But, right now, there&#x27;s something we have to do to break our master out, Pigsy.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> That&#x27;s what I mean, calling me Pigsy is... Forget it... Let&#x27;s go, Sandy!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Please take point. I&#x27;ll cover our backs.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> On it! We&#x27;ve got to make a diversion so the Monkey King can break out Master Tripitaka!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Right, let&#x27;s bring these bandits to justice.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> That was a rather worthwhile training session, wasn&#x27;t it.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Yeah, it was pretty fun! Though, I was pretty surprised when you started beating bad guys up halfway through, Suzuka-onee-san.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Since this was a training exercise, there was no need for a Tripitaka who did nothing but be protected, was there?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Our Master Tripitaka&#x27;s highly capable, after all. Those bandits shouldn&#x27;t have let their guard down.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I would have liked to have seen you two in action as well though, Pigsy, Sandy.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> In that case, should we continue this journey until the end?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I&#x27;m up for that! Let&#x27;s keep going till we beat the Ox King!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Tsubakuro-san, Tripitaka&#x27;s goal isn&#x27;t to defeat the Ox King. We&#x27;re traveling to Tianzhu... to India, to retreive the scriptures.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Oh, we are? Then, let&#x27;s go until we get them!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> But wait, let&#x27;s have Yukari-sama be the Ox King! It&#x27;ll totally be worth fighting her!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> You know we can&#x27;t ask Yukari-sama to do something like that.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ehhh, but you&#x27;ll never know until we try asking!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> And anyway... Can they really recreate the story all the way to India?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I haven&#x27;t checked, but wouldn&#x27;t it be like Ban-san to have gone into that much detail?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Yeah, I&#x27;m getting excited for next time~!  </p><div class="videoWrapper"><iframe width="640" height="480" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/53qQY9kGizE"></iframe></div><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="renpu-summer-uniform---yomi-start-yomi-and-akira"></a>[Renpu Summer Uniform - Yomi: Start]: Yomi and Akira<a class="hash-link" href="#renpu-summer-uniform---yomi-start-yomi-and-akira" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Yomi:</strong> I thought then that, someday, I wanted to be helpful to that person.<br>

<strong>Yomi:</strong> You do?<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong> I do.<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong> Like Fate-chan... you&#x27;re very kind!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Let&#x27;s go back, Takamachi-san.<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong> Sure, Yomi-san!  </p><div class="videoWrapper"><iframe width="640" height="480" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/asuyUPbavRc"></iframe></div><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="dress-21---yomi-start-staying-home-during-the-party"></a>[Dress &#x27;21 - Yomi: Start]: Staying Home During the Party?<a class="hash-link" href="#dress-21---yomi-start-staying-home-during-the-party" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Akane:</strong> That&#x27;s a lovely offer. However, I think it would be a waste for us to be the only ones enjoying it...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> That&#x27;s true, especially when there&#x27;s a whole truck of them...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Hey, hey, what are you talking about? Enjoying what?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Plenty of flowers bloomed in a garden my family manages, so they were donated to the Origami family as a gift.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> We were just talking about how it would be wasteful for only the Origami family to appreciate them.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> What, that&#x27;s it? Then just have a big flower party and invite everybody to come see!<br>
<strong>Akane:</strong> I see, that does sound nice. We might as well send invitations to every toji and person related to the Five Traditions then.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Wonderful. My father would be delighted to hear it too.<br>
<strong>Akane:</strong> Could I ask you all to help with preparing the party venue and sending invitations?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Sure thing! It&#x27;s going to take some work.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> If toji onee-sans are coming from all around the country, I can&#x27;t wait!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Then, how about we get right to dividing up our roles? We should have some in charge of creating and preparing the party venue, some in charge of getting in touch with all those invited, and...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> If there&#x27;s anything you&#x27;d like to be in charge of, go ahead and volunteer.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Then, I&#x27;d like to volunteer...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I didn&#x27;t think you&#x27;d be the one to volunteer yourself... So, what&#x27;d you want to do?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> On the day of the party, everyone should be away, so I thought I could be in charge of staying behind here.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Huhh? Wait, so then, you&#x27;re not coming to the party, Yomi-onee-san?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Right. I don&#x27;t do very well with busy places.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ehhh; you can&#x27;t do that! You have to go-!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> If we&#x27;re throwing a party, all of us have to be there! Can&#x27;t you just go?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Even if I did... I feel like it would be a problem if all of us were away from the Origami estate.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> You do have a point; it wouldn&#x27;t be much of a way to thank the other toji for their efforts if we also left our posts...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> It&#x27;s only right for some of us to stay behind.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Alright; I&#x27;ll watch the place together with Yomi then.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Huhh!? There&#x27;s no way the both of you can&#x27;t go, Maki-onee-san!<br>
<strong>Akane:</strong> If you&#x27;re worried about it, I have a good solution.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> You were listening in, Akane-sama? What&#x27;d you have in mind...?<br>
<strong>Akane:</strong> What if we held the party within the grounds of the Origami estate?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Within the Origami estate...?<br>
<strong>Akane:</strong> It doesn&#x27;t see much use, but we do have a banquet hall we can decorate for the party.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> That&#x27;ll do it! No matter what comes up, we can be right there to deal with it.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Good suggestion, Akane-sama. Yomi-san, you&#x27;ll be there at the party as security for the Origami family, won&#x27;t you?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ...It seems I&#x27;ll have to. If it&#x27;s my mission, I&#x27;ll make sure everyone attending the party is protected.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="dress-21---yomi-end-the-party-guards-outfits"></a>[Dress &#x27;21 - Yomi: End]: The Party Guards&#x27; Outfits!?<a class="hash-link" href="#dress-21---yomi-end-the-party-guards-outfits" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>The day of the party.</p><p><strong>Yume:</strong> The guests&#x27;ll be here soon! Yomi-onee-san, let&#x27;s put our dresses on!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Our dresses...? Wasn&#x27;t it my duty to be guarding the party today?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Everyone will be dressed up, so wouldn&#x27;t you be all the more conspicuous if you were the only one in uniform?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> That&#x27;s why they say, if you want to hide a leaf, do it in a forest.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I see; in that case...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> For the party today, I had lovely dresses with a flower motif prepared for us all. Come along, let&#x27;s get changed.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> We put it on-! How&#x27;s it look?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Wow; you all look fantastic!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Eheheh! It&#x27;s nice getting to go to the party in these cute dresses, huh, Yomi-onee-san!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> It is. I shouldn&#x27;t be surprised, since Konohana-san prepared them for us, but I&#x27;m relieved at how easy they are to move around in.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> It might be a little early, but since we&#x27;ve finished getting dressed, why don&#x27;t we go to the banquet hall?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Sure! Y&#x27;know, you didn&#x27;t want to come before, but you got excited for this too, didn&#x27;t you, Yomi-onee-san!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> No, that&#x27;s not it... I only wanted to give the area a full check before the guests arrived.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Boo-. Even though she&#x27;s in such a cute dress, she still won&#x27;t get out of work mode.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> That&#x27;s one of Yomi-san&#x27;s virtues.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Whoa-! Look, Yomi-onee-san! There&#x27;s flowers put up everywhere!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I never expected them to send us this many flowers...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> It looks like there&#x27;s a big flower stand out in the courtyard too! Let&#x27;s go see!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Please slow down, Tsubakuro-san. You&#x27;re going to trip over if you run that fast.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> But it&#x27;s so pretty out here! Let&#x27;s have a lot of fun at the party, Yomi-onee-san!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Alright. I&#x27;ll be sure to keep on guard, so that you and all the other guests can enjoy it.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Boo-... You&#x27;re still talking about that stuff? We&#x27;re all at the party, so we&#x27;d all be missing out if we didn&#x27;t have fun together.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Yume&#x27;s right. Couldn&#x27;t we trade off so we all have time to enjoy the party?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Still... If, by some chance, a suspicious person arrived...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> If that were to happen, they&#x27;d have all the toji from across the nation to contend with.<br>
<strong>Akane:</strong> With how many toji will be gathered here, this could be one of the safest places in Japan.<br>
<strong>Akane:</strong> So please, try to enjoy yourself tonight, Yomi-san.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Akane-sama... I understand. If that&#x27;s part of my mission, I&#x27;ll try to enjoy it as well.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations/edit/docs/episodes/Satsuki_Yomi_Episodes.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_2_ui" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_3DPF"></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/tnm-translations/docs/episodes/Konohana_Suzuka_Episodes/"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Â« Konohana Suzuka Episodes</div></a></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/tnm-translations/docs/episodes/Tsubakuro_Yume_Episodes/"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Next</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Tsubakuro Yume Episodes Â»</div></a></div></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_35-E thin-scrollbar"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#1-elite-guard-tea-party" class="table-of-contents__link">1: Elite Guard Tea Party</a></li><li><a href="#2-ahh-so-mbarrisin" class="table-of-contents__link">2: Ahh, So &#39;Mbarrisin</a></li><li><a href="#3-fear-the-namahage" class="table-of-contents__link">3: Fear the Namahage</a></li><li><a href="#4-i-do-love-rice-after-all" class="table-of-contents__link">4: I Do Love Rice, After All</a></li><li><a href="#5-feelings-in-passing" class="table-of-contents__link">5: Feelings in Passing</a></li><li><a href="#bride-yomi-start-undercover-investigation-yomis-case" class="table-of-contents__link">Bride Yomi: Start: Undercover Investigation (Yomi&#39;s Case)</a></li><li><a href="#bride-yomi-end-please-dont-look" class="table-of-contents__link">Bride Yomi: End: Please Don&#39;t Look</a></li><li><a href="#ceremonial-dress---misogi-start-yomis-weak-point" class="table-of-contents__link">Ceremonial Dress - Misogi: Start: Yomi&#39;s Weak Point</a></li><li><a href="#ceremonial-dress---misogi-end-to-one-day-repay-her" class="table-of-contents__link">Ceremonial Dress - Misogi: End: To One Day Repay Her</a></li><li><a href="#yukata-yomi-start-we-mustnt-get-lost" class="table-of-contents__link">Yukata Yomi: Start: We Mustn&#39;t Get Lost</a></li><li><a href="#yukata-yomi-end-someday-in-memory" class="table-of-contents__link">Yukata Yomi: End: Someday, in Memory</a></li><li><a href="#valkyrie---yomi-start-a-sudden-call-from-akira" class="table-of-contents__link">Valkyrie - Yomi: Start: A Sudden Call from Akira</a></li><li><a href="#valkyrie---yomi-end-this-one-is-my-favorite" class="table-of-contents__link">Valkyrie - Yomi: End: This One is My Favorite</a></li><li><a href="#xmas-19---yomi-start-an-unpredictable-present" class="table-of-contents__link">Xmas' 19 - Yomi: Start: An Unpredictable Present</a></li><li><a href="#xmas-19---yomi-end-the-fun-of-giving" class="table-of-contents__link">Xmas' 19 - Yomi: End: The Fun of Giving</a></li><li><a href="#journey-to-the-west---yomi-start-what-is-tsubakuro-san-going-to-do" class="table-of-contents__link">Journey to the West - Yomi: Start: What Is Tsubakuro-san Going to Do?</a></li><li><a href="#journey-to-the-west---yomi-end-it-might-be-nice-to-continue-our-journey" class="table-of-contents__link">Journey to the West - Yomi: End: It Might Be Nice to Continue Our Journey</a></li><li><a href="#renpu-summer-uniform---yomi-start-yomi-and-akira" class="table-of-contents__link">Renpu Summer Uniform - Yomi: Start: Yomi and Akira</a></li><li><a href="#renpu-summer-uniform---yomi-end-someday" class="table-of-contents__link">Renpu Summer Uniform - Yomi: End: Someday</a></li><li><a href="#mahou-shoujo---yomi-start-similar-to-someone" class="table-of-contents__link">Mahou Shoujo - Yomi: Start: Similar to Someone</a></li><li><a href="#mahou-shoujo---yomi-end-yomi-and-nanoha" class="table-of-contents__link">Mahou Shoujo - Yomi: End: Yomi and Nanoha</a></li><li><a href="#dress-21---yomi-start-staying-home-during-the-party" class="table-of-contents__link">Dress '21 - Yomi: Start: Staying Home During the Party?</a></li><li><a href="#dress-21---yomi-end-the-party-guards-outfits" class="table-of-contents__link">Dress '21 - Yomi: End: The Party Guards&#39;
