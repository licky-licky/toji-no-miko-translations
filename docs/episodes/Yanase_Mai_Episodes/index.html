Today&#x27;s special guest is... Mihono-chan!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Umm. Hi, Yanase-san. Sorry if I&#x27;m being a bother.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I ran into Kanami before, and she said I should tag along, so...<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Don&#x27;t worry, it&#x27;s fine. Sorry I invited you here so abruptly, Asakura-san, Kanami-chan.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah, something smells really good!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Mai-chan, you made that, didn&#x27;t you! The stuff that&#x27;s all sticky and smooth~.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> That&#x27;s right. I can&#x27;t believe you figured it out already, Kanami-chan. I made pudding, but actually...<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Ah, you should try some first! I just hope it turned out alright.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Everything you make turns out great, Mai-chan!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> ...R-Right.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Yanase-san? What&#x27;s wrong? You look upset about something.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Sorry, it&#x27;s nothing! Here, come on inside!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Whoa, it looks delicious. You sure I can eat this!?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Of course. If you&#x27;re sure you want some, go right ahead.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> No one in the world wouldn&#x27;t want your cooking, Mai-chan! Anyway, I&#x27;m digging in-!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Me too! Down the hatch-!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Mhmmm, ahh...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> It&#x27;s... It&#x27;s too yummy!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Thank goodness. But, um... Was there anything else that you noticed about it?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> It&#x27;s just really tasty.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah, it&#x27;s so tasty!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Th-Thank you. But, let&#x27;s see, for example, if it tastes like anything you&#x27;ve tried before...<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Like, maybe, a certain shop&#x27;s pudding...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Anything I&#x27;ve tried? Umm... Mihono-chan, what do you think?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I don&#x27;t really... Go out shopping much, so I don&#x27;t know. But, Yanase-san, I feel like your pudding&#x27;s better than anything I could buy?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah, I feel the same! I&#x27;ve never had anything like it. Mai-chan, your pudding&#x27;s amazing!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> ...A-Ahaha, thank you.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Mai-chan? Something&#x27;s bothering you, isn&#x27;t it?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> It&#x27;s not a big deal... This was just a bit of a failure.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Eh, how!?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> To tell the truth, I was trying to copy the pudding from a shop I love.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> A shop Mai-chan loves... &quot;Plumeria&quot;?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ahh... Mmm? Now that you mention it, it tastes sort of alike, I think?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> (Ughh, I can&#x27;t believe I said I don&#x27;t go out much...)<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> No, don&#x27;t worry about it, Kanami-chan... After all, it&#x27;d be strange if I could copy a famous chef&#x27;s pudding so easily.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> My little sisters, they told me they wanted to be able get the same taste at home. So I kept on practicing time and time again, and kept going to eat the real thing to compare, and I used all the same materials, just as fresh...!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Yanase... San?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I tried heating with different intensity, and steaming it differently, and lots of different containers. But why, even though I keep on trying... No, I just can&#x27;t get it to taste any good.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I love cooking sweets so much, but in the end I&#x27;m just an amateur...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> You&#x27;re frustrated, huh, Mai-chan.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Eh, you can tell...?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> It&#x27;s kind of hard not to notice, I think?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Oh no, I&#x27;m sorry. I just got carried away.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> It&#x27;s alright. I almost never get to see you like this, after all.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Eh?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> You&#x27;re usually so calm and composed, and it feels like you can do anything. But seeing you act like this is pretty cute too. Right, Mihono-chan?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah, I feel like my image of Yanase-san changed a little!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Eh... Really...?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Hey, do you want to try this again, Mai-chan? I&#x27;ll sample it as much as you want. You&#x27;ll join in too, right, Mihono-chan?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah, if you&#x27;ll let me, I&#x27;ll try some anytime. Today&#x27;s was good too! I mean it; it was really yummy!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Asakura-san, Kanami-chan...<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Thank you. I&#x27;m so glad I had you two taste it.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I&#x27;m a little depressed, but I&#x27;ll keep on trying... I&#x27;ll challenge it again, I promise!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah! I&#x27;m looking forward to it. But if you mess up, that&#x27;s okay. It just means we get to eat even more!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I think I&#x27;d be happy with that too?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Geez, cut it out, you two. Next time I&#x27;ll get it right for sure! ...Fufu.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="2-what-is-femininity"></a>2: What is Femininity?<a class="hash-link" href="#2-what-is-femininity" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Mai:</strong> What should I do with these? I made too many cookies. Kanami-chan would be able to eat them all, but... She isn&#x27;t back yet.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Thank goodness, I got this month&#x27;s edition. I have to get back to my room and read the latest report-<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Eh!?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Kyaa!<br>
<em>the two collide</em></p><p><strong>Mai:</strong> Oww... S-Sorry. I was lost in thought.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> No, I wasn&#x27;t looking where I was going...! I&#x27;m so sorry!!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Um, you&#x27;re Musumi-san, right? Are you hurt? This magazine... It&#x27;s yours, isn&#x27;t it? Here.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Thank you so much! And I really am sorry. You&#x27;re... Yanase-san, aren&#x27;t you?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Yes. From Minoseki.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ahhhh!! Yanase-san, when I bumped into you just now, did those...!?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Oh my. The cookies... They got crushed, didn&#x27;t they? But please, don&#x27;t worry about it.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I&#x27;m so sorry, were they a present from someone? I&#x27;ll buy you replacements.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Oh, these are just something I made myself. Really, it&#x27;s not worth fussing over.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Eh!? You mean those are handmade!? They look so cute...<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> They might be a little broken, but would you like to try them?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Can I!?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> These are delicious...! Can you share the recipe with me, Yanase-san?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Recipe? ...I don&#x27;t really use them. I just go with what feels right when I&#x27;m cooking.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> More importantly, Musumi-san, there&#x27;s crumbs getting on your magazine...! Here, lay this handkerchief on top of it.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Ah, that&#x27;s right. Take a tissue as well, so you can wipe your hands.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...You&#x27;re so feminine, Yanase-san.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Eh?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I&#x27;m jealous...! I could never be so considerate, and cooking without a recipe would just be impossible for me...<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> It&#x27;s not like that. Baking things is just my hobby. When I&#x27;m cooking, I can really lose myself in it, and when I&#x27;m done, I like seeing others enjoy it.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> What about you, Musumi-san? What do you do in your spare time?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Eh, me...? Reading, is about all I do.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Reading? What kind of books do you read?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> L-Love stories, mostly. And, I read magazines... Like this one.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Is that so. Let me see... &quot;The Number 1 Must Buys This Season, Introducing Kamo Chinami&#x27;s Mix and Match Technique&quot;...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> This report is always so handy. If you pick out whatever appears in here, it can make any outfit look cuter.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It&#x27;s a big help in picking out accessories, for example, or, i-if I ever go on a date, what to wear...<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> R-Really? Musumi-san, you seem so... Mature.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Eh....? Yanase-san, are you not interested in this kind of thing?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I-I never really thought about it much.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I don&#x27;t know that much about it myself. I just think, whenever I&#x27;m going out, that I should be a little fashionable. If someone ever thinks I&#x27;m cute, well...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That&#x27;d be wonderful.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Somehow, I feel like... You&#x27;re already pretty wonderful, Musumi-san. Talking to you like this, it&#x27;s like you&#x27;re sparkling.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> It&#x27;s normal for girls to be interested in wearing cute clothes, isn&#x27;t it? But I&#x27;m clueless when it comes to this...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> In that case, Yanase-san! I&#x27;ll lend you this magazine!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Eh?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> If you read it, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll feel much better about fashion. Think of it as a thank you for these cute cookies.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I really wish I could make you cookies like these as thanks, but it seems too difficult for me...<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Musumi-san... Thank you. But, isn&#x27;t this this month&#x27;s issue? You can give it to me after you&#x27;re through reading it.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Oh, before then... If you&#x27;re interested, how about we bake cookies together next time?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> It doesn&#x27;t have to be cookies either. We can make all sorts of cute sweets that&#x27;ll get you all worked up.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Eh!? You don&#x27;t mind me joining you?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Of course not. When it comes to making sweets, I have some experience. And, next time...<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I&#x27;d like it if you shared with me some of your magazines.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That sounds great! I&#x27;ll bring all kinds with me!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Fufu. Then, until next time. It&#x27;s a promise.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="3-as-a-toji"></a>3: As a Toji<a class="hash-link" href="#3-as-a-toji" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Chie:</strong> Mihono-chan, Kiyoka-chan! It seems like... We managed to deal with all the aradama.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> It&#x27;s all thanks to the help of our reinforcement. I&#x27;m Setouchi Chie. And you are...?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Yanase Mai, from Minoseki. I&#x27;m a classmate of Asakura-san... Of Mihono-chan.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> You saved us-! Thanks, Mai. That&#x27;s Minoseki&#x27;s tournament rep for you; you were awesome back there!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ahhh, oh yeah! Musumi-san, are you okay?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Yes... Um, sorry, I&#x27;m just... I&#x27;m not very good at fighting...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Kya! Another aradama!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Still...!? Yanase-san, our teammates should be returning any minute, so could you help us a little longer?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Of course!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Minoseki&#x27;s representative... I can see why. Even against those aradama, your posture never faltered, and your swordsmanship stayed clean.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> See? I told you she&#x27;s good, Chii-nee.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Th-Thank you.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> And, on top of that, she&#x27;s a super rich girl. She&#x27;s got a butler and everything!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> A butler... That sounds kind of amazing.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> B-But wait, then why are you a toji? It&#x27;s a dangerous position. For a high class girl like you...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> You&#x27;re right, it&#x27;s a little weird. But being a toji is a really respectable position, isn&#x27;t it? Maybe her family wanted her to do it or something.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> ...I decided to become a toji and worked towards it on my own.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> It&#x27;s dangerous work, but it also keeps everyone safe. So I wanted to try it.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Luckily, I was capable of using an okatana, and one of them accepted me.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> You sound so responsible. At least, I wouldn&#x27;t expect that from a middle schooler.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Why&#x27;re you looking at me, Chii-nee.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> But, aren&#x27;t you scared?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I do get scared. Though, when I grip my okatana, all those feelings fade away.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I train with that in mind, and somehow I manage.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> That&#x27;s so cool, Mai. It&#x27;s like you have a totally different kind of strength than Kanami.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> You have to try your best too, Mihono-chan. Starting with your concentration... Right?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ahaha... I need to work on that, huh...  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="4-late-night-cookies"></a>4: Late Night Cookies<a class="hash-link" href="#4-late-night-cookies" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Mai:</strong> Excuse me...<br>

<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...They escaped. Because I lost.<br>

<strong>Mai:</strong> I made too many cookies. Do you like sweets, Sayaka-chan?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...Mm. Ah, um, yes...<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Great. Then, I&#x27;d be happy if you had some.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Happy...?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Anyway, if they find me here, I&#x27;ll get in trouble, so I&#x27;d better go now.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Thank you for talking to me. I&#x27;ll see you later.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...Mm...<br>

<strong>Hashima Ema:</strong> Yanase-san.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Ah... President?<br>
<strong>Ema:</strong> Those two will be alright.<br>
<strong>Ema:</strong> Though, of course you&#x27;d be worried. She&#x27;s your best friend, after all.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> After what happened, there&#x27;s been so much on my mind.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I&#x27;m worried about Kanami-chan. At the same time, I&#x27;m sure if anyone can get through this, it&#x27;s Kanami-chan.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> But...<br>
<strong>Ema:</strong> There&#x27;s something else bothering you, isn&#x27;t there?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I just, don&#x27;t know what to think anymore. How should I go on as a toji after this?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I don&#x27;t have Kanami-chan&#x27;s pure love for swordfighting. I don&#x27;t have the drive to get stronger like her.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> This may sound imprudent, but... I don&#x27;t have the resolve Juujou-san must have had to turn her blade on Origami Yukari-sama either.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Being a toji means keeping everyone safe, and I came this far because I thought of it as a commendable job.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> But... Is that really enough?<br>
<strong>Ema:</strong> I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything wrong with you advancing through a sense of pride. But you&#x27;re feeling uncomfortable with that now, aren&#x27;t you, Yanase-san?<br>
<strong>Ema:</strong> Hmm, then... In that case, I think you&#x27;re a little mistaken in what you said.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> In what I said?<br>
<strong>Ema:</strong> Truthfully, it&#x27;s not about this being a commendable job, but because you wanted to become a toji who could protect others. And you&#x27;re wondering if that desire alone is enough. Am I wrong?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> ...!<br>
<strong>Ema:</strong> There are those with a deep love of swordfighting, and those who hide strong convictions. Comparatively, your desire might not seem like much. Not enough to risk your life over.<br>
<strong>Ema:</strong> If that&#x27;s what&#x27;s bothering you, I think I understand.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> ...You might be right. But, I&#x27;m not sure. I can&#x27;t tell if what I aspired to be was simply because I thought it was praiseworthy.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Seeing Kanami-chan and Juujou-san, I can&#x27;t help but think I was being naive...<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I&#x27;m wondering, if I should really continue with this...<br>
<strong>Ema:</strong> Fufu. Don&#x27;t worry.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> President...?<br>
<strong>Ema:</strong> I can&#x27;t say for sure whether you should continue.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> You can&#x27;t say...?<br>
<strong>Ema:</strong> That&#x27;s right. However, don&#x27;t belittle your desires. That&#x27;s where all your strength is born from.<br>
<strong>Ema:</strong> Yanase-san. You don&#x27;t have to rush. Collect your thoughts, and have faith in yourself. When the time comes, you&#x27;ll clearly see the path you should follow again.<br>
<strong>Ema:</strong> With that, I need to leave for the night.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> President...<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> ...I understand. I&#x27;ll try having a little more faith in myself.  </p><div class="videoWrapper"><iframe width="640" height="480" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d4UPDxCWrUY"></iframe></div><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="misogi--mai-start-my-first-shock"></a>[Misogi- Mai: Start]: My First Shock<a class="hash-link" href="#misogi--mai-start-my-first-shock" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>--After being accepted to Minoseki Academy.</p><p><strong>Minoseki Academy Teacher:</strong> Alright, this might be your first swordfighting lesson after entering Minoseki Academy, but...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I know! I&#x27;m really excited for it!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> (That girl, her name was... Etou-san, wasn&#x27;t it? So she was looking forward to our swordfighting lessons that much...)<br>
<strong>Minoseki Academy Teacher:</strong> Looks like we&#x27;ve got a lively one with us. To start us off, we&#x27;ll have you learn what your classmates are capable of.<br>
<strong>Minoseki Academy Teacher:</strong> You&#x27;ll be fighting against everyone... But first, pair up with the person next to you!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I&#x27;ll be in your care, Yanase-san!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> S-Sure, likewise.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> (We&#x27;ll have to fight each of our classmates? Which would mean, I&#x27;ll have to think about how to conserve my energy...)<br>
<strong>Minoseki Academy Teacher:</strong> Now then... Begin!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> (Wait, she&#x27;s not attacking?)<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> (That&#x27;s sort of a let-down. With how she was acting, I thought she&#x27;d come straight at me as soon as we began...)<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I&#x27;m ready anytime.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> (Her stance is... Seigan. It&#x27;s so orthodox that there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any scheme behind it. There&#x27;s no need for tricks like that in our very first lesson anyway.)<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> (In which case... I&#x27;ll go!)<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> YAAAAH!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> -!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> ...Eh!?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> (She dodged it... And so easily too...)<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> There&#x27;s hardly any wasted movements... You love swordfighting too, don&#x27;t you, Yanase-san!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Show me more of your swordsmanship!<br>
<strong>Minoseki Academy Teacher:</strong> That&#x27;s enough!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Pant, pant...<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> (I wasn&#x27;t any match for her at all... Etou-san, just who are you...)<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Yanase-san, you&#x27;re so strong!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> You too, Etou-san...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Just call me Kanami!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> (There&#x27;s somebody... This amazing here... Etou... Kanami...)<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Kanami-chan...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah, Mai-chan!<br>

<strong>Mai:</strong> ...Eh?<br>
<strong>Friend B:</strong> Ah, I was thinking the same thing. Ever since that swordfighting lesson, right?<br>
<strong>Friend A:</strong> Well, Kanami was pretty amazing.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Th-That&#x27;s only because... See, Kanami-chan may be strong, but, don&#x27;t you think she&#x27;s unsafe in some ways? Like, she might prioritize swordfighting over her own well being...<br>
<strong>Friend B:</strong> You say that, but isn&#x27;t the truth that you just wound up having a crush on her?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I do not!! Don&#x27;t go making assumptions like that!!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="misogi--mai-end-the-name-of-this-feeling-is-admiration"></a>[Misogi- Mai: End]: The Name of This Feeling is Admiration<a class="hash-link" href="#misogi--mai-end-the-name-of-this-feeling-is-admiration" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Friend A:</strong> Eh, Mai...?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I-I&#x27;m sorry! There&#x27;s something the teacher asked me to take care of!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> ...Sigh.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> (Why did I get so upset when she said that... I&#x27;d better... apologize to her, shouldn&#x27;t I...)<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> (But... I don&#x27;t understand it myself, why I reacted like that... I could tell right away she was only joking...)<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> But, Kanami-chan...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> You called?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> K-Kanami-chan!? Why are you...?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Actually... I saw what happened before. And then, I followed you here.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> If it&#x27;s alright with you, you can talk it over with me, okay?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> ...Thank you, Kanami-chan.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Why&#x27;d you get so mad? Can I ask you that?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> That&#x27;s because...<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> (I can&#x27;t exactly tell her it&#x27;s because they asked if I liked you, can I...)<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> It was my fault. They were only teasing me a little, but I got seriously upset...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> ...Was it because, they made fun of something important to you?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Eh?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> When I think, &quot;If it were me, what would I get mad if someone made fun of?&quot;, it&#x27;s got to be swordfighting of course!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Fufu, I could see that, Kanami-chan.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> (But then... That means, I got upset because Kanami-chan is important to me?)<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> And also... If somebody made fun of somebody you respect, you&#x27;d feel bad too, wouldn&#x27;t you?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Someone you respect... Yeah, respect! That&#x27;s it, Kanami-chan!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Thank you for letting me talk this over with you!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Sure! Wait, huh? Thinking back, I feel like I was the one doing all the talking...<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Still, that&#x27;s fine! I&#x27;m going to go apologize to them!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I&#x27;m sorry!<br>
<strong>Friend A:</strong> No, we&#x27;re the ones who should be saying sorry. We were being sort of insensitive.<br>
<strong>Friend B:</strong> We were. But, I didn&#x27;t think that you actually did like Kanami... We&#x27;ll do what we can to support you two, Mai!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Eh!? Th-That&#x27;s not it! You misunderstand!<br>
<strong>Friend A:</strong> ...It&#x27;s not?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> That&#x27;s right. Kanami-chan, she&#x27;s the first opponent I didn&#x27;t think I could beat in swordfighting, so I respect her a lot.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> But, when you teased me about it... I think that&#x27;s why I couldn&#x27;t help but get angry all of a sudden.<br>
<strong>Friend A:</strong> So that&#x27;s what it was. It happens, huh.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> We might be the same age, but... Kanami-chan was just so much stronger. That&#x27;s why... Someday, I&#x27;d like to be about as strong as Kanami-chan.<br>
<strong>Friend B:</strong> She definitely is. We&#x27;ll have to work real hard ourselves-.<br>

<strong>Mai:</strong> And then, we also talked about using a big iron plate and making enough yakisoba for everyone.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> So long as we bring noodles, we can make it with the ingredients from the barbecue.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...From talking about food, I started feeling a little hungry.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I know what you mean. Talking like this makes you feel hungry, doesn&#x27;t it?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> But, it&#x27;s probably best if you don&#x27;t eat this late.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm... I&#x27;ll hold off. I have to brush my teeth soon.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> In that case, I&#x27;ll be going back to my room.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> I&#x27;ll see you tomorrow. Goodnight, Mai.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Mmhm, goodnight.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Ah... Wait.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Hm? What is it?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Tomorrow... If you can, I want you to call me when you wake up... I&#x27;m not sure I can wake up on my own.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...Is that okay?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> That&#x27;s fine. I&#x27;ll give you a call. And, if that doesn&#x27;t wake you up, I&#x27;ll come get you up myself.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Please do that. Thanks.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="swimsuit-20---mai-end-swim-ring-tubing"></a>[Swimsuit 20 - Mai: End]: Swim Ring Tubing!<a class="hash-link" href="#swimsuit-20---mai-end-swim-ring-tubing" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> That was good-. Why is it that meat tastes so much better eating under a big blue sky?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah, and of course, the yakisoba you and Mai made was really yummy too, Chii-nee!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> I&#x27;m glad you liked it. Ah, Mihono-chan. If you want to go play, you have to wait a little after you eat, alright?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I know that much-!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> What did you think, Sayaka-chan? How was the meat you cooked yourself?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> It was tasty. But, I wasn&#x27;t sure how much to grill it at first, so I burnt some.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I know what you mean. There were times I burned things when I first started cooking. I was worried I might undercook it.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> You did it too, Mai? I want to try doing this again. With Kaoru next time.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> It would be nice to come again when Kaoru is free.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Now that we&#x27;ve eaten, why don&#x27;t we take a short break and then go to the river?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> It seems like there&#x27;s places where the river hardly flows at all, and you can just leisurely float along.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> That sounds like Kaoru would like it.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> That&#x27;s true. If Kaoru-chan were here, I could see her relaxing with Nene-chan.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Tubing on the river. I was looking forward to it so much, after we finished talking last night, I couldn&#x27;t fall asleep right away. I want to hurry and do it.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Kyaaaa!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Just then! The water was moving a little faster...!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Y-Yeah. There&#x27;s a pretty big difference in speed at some points of the river, isn&#x27;t there.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Sometimes it slows down, and sometimes it speeds up a little!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Mmhm... It&#x27;s like a ride at an amusement park...!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> It&#x27;s really... fun!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> When the water splashes you, it feels nice and cool.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Wahh-!?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Are you alright, Sayaka-chan!?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> I&#x27;m fine. The swim ring just started sinking a little.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Ah... You scared me.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Oh, the tubing attendant is there. It looks like that&#x27;s the end.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Hey, Sayaka-chan? Do you want to go one more time? Tubing back down the river.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> I was just thinking I wanted to go again.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mai... You&#x27;re amazing.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Fufu. But Sayaka-chan, that&#x27;s because your face is saying you wanted to do it even more.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Besides, I had a lot of fun doing it too.  </p><div class="videoWrapper"><iframe width="640" height="480" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vh6dekDJVps"></iframe></div><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="stage-girl---mai-start-two-triangles"></a>[Stage Girl - Mai: Start]: Two Triangles<a class="hash-link" href="#stage-girl---mai-start-two-triangles" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Kanami:</strong> I can&#x27;t wait to spar with all these stage girls! If I pass this up, I&#x27;ll never get another chance like it.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Honestly, ever since we came here and I saw them fighting aradama, I&#x27;ve wanted to spar with them-.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> You said the same thing back when you first saw Hiyori-chan at the tournament, didn&#x27;t you, Kanami-chan.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ehehe.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> You did? Though it sounds just like something you&#x27;d do.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah, Hiyori-chan. What&#x27;s up?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> What do you mean, &quot;What&#x27;s up?&quot; You&#x27;re the one who said to meet here so we could spar now.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Oh yeah! Then, let&#x27;s get right to it! I&#x27;ll catch up with you later, Mai-chan~.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Okay. Be sure not to get hurt, you two.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Mahiru:</strong> Mai-chan?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Tsuyuzaki-san? Did you need something?<br>
<strong>Mahiru:</strong> Nothing in particular, but, I was watching you with Kanami-chan. You seem close.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> We sure are. As soon as we met in middle school, we were fast friends. We spend lots of time together, in classes and in the dorms.<br>
<strong>Mahiru:</strong> Just like Karen-chan and I. Since the start of high school, we&#x27;ve always been together as roommates! Though now there&#x27;s three of us, since Hikari-chan moved in.<br>
<strong>Mahiru:</strong> What about Hiyori-chan? Her uniform is different, so she&#x27;s from a different school, isn&#x27;t she?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> We got to know Hiyori-chan during an incident at the tournament in our second year, and we&#x27;ve been friends ever since.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> It all started with Kanami-chan befriending Hiyori-chan.<br>
<strong>Mahiru:</strong> So that&#x27;s what happened.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Mai-chaaan, Tsuyuzaki-saaan! There&#x27;s some aradama, so come over here!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> We should go.<br>
<strong>Mahiru:</strong> Okay!<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> GGGIIII!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Tsuyuzaki-san, one of the aradama went that way! Could you get it!<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> GGIIIII!<br>
<strong>Mahiru:</strong> It&#x27;s a little... scary, but I&#x27;ll do it!<br>
<strong>Mahiru:</strong> EIIIIIII!!<br>
<strong>Mahiru:</strong> There! Home run!<br>
<strong>Mahiru:</strong> It looks like we just finished cleaning up the aradama too.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> The aradama&#x27;s really gone... You&#x27;re incredible, Mahiru-san.<br>
<strong>Mahiru:</strong> It sort of looked like a ball, so I just gave it a good whack on reflex.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> That was only by reflex...?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> And not just that, but how you casually twirled around that weapon of yours like a baton as you fought...<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> The way you moved... I think I could use it as reference in future fights.<br>
<strong>Mahiru:</strong> It&#x27;s sort of embarrassing hearing you talk like that, Mai-chan.<br>
<strong>Mahiru:</strong> But, would it really be helpful learning from me?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I&#x27;d like to give it a try. Will you teach me how?<br>
<strong>Mahiru:</strong> Mmm, but even if I teach you how to twirl a baton, it&#x27;s not very useful for fighting, is it? I just somehow make it work...<br>
<strong>Mahiru:</strong> I know! Mai-chan, could we try training like we&#x27;re really fighting?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Of course, if that&#x27;s alright with you.<br>
<strong>Mahiru:</strong> Then, let&#x27;s do it over there.<br>
<strong>Mahiru:</strong> I love the shining stage, but I love seeing you shine even more. I want to dance with you forever, in a duet going round and round. 99th generation, Tsuyuzaki Mahiru.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> That line just now had such a stylish ring to it.<br>
<strong>Mahiru:</strong> Ehehe, thank you. It makes me happy, hearing you say that. I get the feeling we&#x27;re sort of alike, Mai-chan.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> We&#x27;re alike?<br>
<strong>Mahiru:</strong> But we can talk about that after!<br>
<strong>Mahiru:</strong> Fighting might be more of your specialty, but come try me, Mai-chan!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Here I come!<br>
<strong>Mahiru:</strong> Ah, but I would appreciate it if you&#x27;d go a little easy on me after all.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="stage-girl---mai-end-i-love-seeing-you-shine-even-more"></a>[Stage Girl - Mai: End]: I Love Seeing You Shine Even More<a class="hash-link" href="#stage-girl---mai-end-i-love-seeing-you-shine-even-more" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Mahiru:</strong> Phew... I worked up a good sweat.<br>
<strong>Mahiru:</strong> How was that? I hope it was helpful getting to see it up close at least.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> It was. Though, I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll be able to put it into practice straight away.<br>
<strong>Mahiru:</strong> It would be difficult to use your okatana the same way I use my weapon, wouldn&#x27;t it.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I think it&#x27;s incredible enough that you can use that weapon like a baton, Tsuyuzaki-san!<br>
<strong>Mahiru:</strong> You keep flattering me so much, Mai-chan~.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Ah, by the way. Before we started training, you told me the two of us were alike?<br>
<strong>Mahiru:</strong> Yeah, about that. I sort of had the feeling that the relationship between you, Kanami-chan, and Hiyori-chan was similar to us.<br>
<strong>Mahiru:</strong> I told you earlier, but, I&#x27;m roommates with Karen-chan, and I love her and we&#x27;ve always been together.<br>
<strong>Mahiru:</strong> But then... When we were in our second year of high school, Hikari-chan, Karen-chan&#x27;s childhood friend, transferred in.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Now that you say that, it does feel a little alike.<br>
<strong>Mahiru:</strong> At the time... I felt like Hikari-chan was stealing Karen-chan away from me... I felt really anxious for a while...<br>
<strong>Mahiru:</strong> That&#x27;s why, I know I&#x27;m being a busybody, but I was kind of worried about how things are for you.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Thank you for your concern. Though, I&#x27;m fine. Kanami-chan and Hiyori-chan are both close friends of mine.<br>
<strong>Mahiru:</strong> I&#x27;m glad to hear it. Sorry, for asking you something so weird.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Not at all.<br>
<strong>Mahiru:</strong> Ahh, even though I&#x27;m the older one here, I&#x27;m acting kind of presumptuous. You really feel more reliable, Mai-chan.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> That&#x27;s not true; I&#x27;m still working on that myself.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Since we came to this world, you&#x27;ve worried about the troubles we&#x27;re having more times than I can remember.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> You&#x27;re like our reliable big sister.<br>
<strong>Mahiru:</strong> Well, I am a big sister. I have a little sister and brother at home. Maybe it&#x27;s because of them, but I always find myself wanting to help others.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Ah, I have two little sisters myself.<br>
<strong>Mahiru:</strong> We&#x27;re the same~.<br>
<strong>Mahiru:</strong> I don&#x27;t mind going out of my way to help people, or I guess I should say, I just feel like I need to do something.<br>
<strong>Mahiru:</strong> I used to help even more with Karen-chan in the past. Like helping her get out of bed in the mornings.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I can&#x27;t help myself from taking care of things for my friends either. Though, sometimes they say I&#x27;m being overprotective...<br>
<strong>Mahiru:</strong> Hmmm, but, if the person you&#x27;re helping isn&#x27;t bothered by it, isn&#x27;t it alright?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> That&#x27;s how I feel!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Good work, you two-.<br>
<strong>Karen:</strong> Mahiru-chan, you sorta look like you&#x27;re getting along with Mai-chan. What were you talking about?<br>
<strong>Mahiru:</strong> About how we tend to look after others, and how we&#x27;re a little bit a like.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Now that you mention it, you might be similar to each other.<br>
<strong>Hikari:</strong> But when it comes to looking after others, I think you overdo it some.<br>
<strong>Mahiru:</strong> If you could keep everything in order yourself, Hikari-chan, I wouldn&#x27;t argue. Can you?<br>
<strong>Hikari:</strong> Nn...<br>
<strong>Karen:</strong> I want you to help with that, Mahiru-chan. Without you around, our room would look like a disaster zone.<br>
<strong>Mahiru:</strong> You and Hikari-chan should make sure to tidy up after yourselves, Karen-chan~.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Hey, Mai-chan. I&#x27;ve got something I want to ask from you.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Like what? I&#x27;m all ears.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I was eating the sweets Daiba-san made earlier. And I started wanting to have some of your cookies.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> When we get back, could you make some for me...?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Mm, I&#x27;ll make you some.<br>

<strong>Mai:</strong> What about you, Kanami-chan, Sayaka-chan?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> I&#x27;m going to spend it at home with my family.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I&#x27;m doing the same as Sayaka-chan. Hey, since we&#x27;re all together, want to do our first shrine visit together too?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Sounds good! Let&#x27;s do it in furisode!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Furisode?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> We don&#x27;t really have to wear that stuff, do we? It&#x27;s annoying.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> No! That&#x27;s no good, Kaoru! If we&#x27;re doing it, we all have to wear furisode!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I think I agree with Ellen-chan. I&#x27;d like to make our first shrine visit all wearing furisode together.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> I don&#x27;t have a furisode.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Eh?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve got one either...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Same here. It&#x27;s not that big a deal if we don&#x27;t wear one, is it?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> No way! I want everybody wearing one!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> How old are you!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Ahaha...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> In that case, how about this! I&#x27;ll get furisode for everybody!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Is that how badly you want us to wear them...<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Ah, hang on, Ellen-chan. Won&#x27;t it be hard for you to prepare enough for everyone?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I think I have one at home that should fit Sayaka-chan&#x27;s size. I might have one that fits Kaoru-chan too...<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> It&#x27;s fine; Ellen&#x27;ll get one for me.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Okay.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> That&#x27;s that then!<br>

<strong>Ellen:</strong> Did you really do a lot of thinking for that?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Course I did-.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> I came up with a bunch of other stuff, like, &quot;Bring down divine punishment on the president&quot;, or &quot;Make it so all my traveling is in first class.&quot;<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> What&#x27;d you come up with anyway?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> &quot;For lots of fun things to happen!&quot;<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> That sounds like you, Ellen-chan.<br>

<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...<br>

<strong>Mai:</strong> What are you going to pray for, Sayaka-chan?<br>
