Engaging in combat!<br>
<strong>Subordinate A:</strong> Shidou-san! You&#x27;re pushing too far ahead! You&#x27;re our captain, so please don&#x27;t be so risky!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> It&#x27;s because I&#x27;m the captain that I need to take the lead. I couldn&#x27;t stand seeing any of my girls get hurt.<br>
<strong>Subordinate:</strong> B: Shidou-san! There&#x27;s a giant aradama approaching from the northeast!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> What!? ...This one seems difficult.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I&#x27;ll manage that one by myself. The rest of you, get rid of the aradama in the surrounding area.<br>
<strong>Subordinate A:</strong> Are you serious!? That&#x27;s too much for anyone to fight alone!!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Don&#x27;t worry. Have faith in me!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Nice job. It&#x27;s thanks to all your efforts that we were able to finish this without casualties.<br>
<strong>Subordinate A:</strong> We only stayed safe because you took care of that dangerous aradama all by yourself, Shidou-san.<br>
<strong>Subordinate B:</strong> Your strength is on a completely different level than ours. That&#x27;s why I admire you so much, Shidou-san.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I have to be. I&#x27;m the captain, after all.<br>
<strong>Subordinate A:</strong> I love how humble you can be about your accomplishments too...<br>
<strong>Subordinate B:</strong> Shidou-san&#x27;s smoother than any guy, isn&#x27;t she...<br>
<strong>Subordinate C:</strong> Sigh... You&#x27;re such a ladykiller, Shidou-san...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> --Good work, Maki-san. It seems you&#x27;ve accomplished quite a lot again today.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> And you&#x27;re as popular as ever among the girls of your unit.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> It&#x27;d be bad if the captain wasn&#x27;t popular, you know.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I believe it&#x27;s a slightly different sort of popularity than you think, though.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> (Maki-san can truly be dense about that sort of thing. Fufufu. Well, that may also be part of the reason behind her popularity.)  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="2-shidou-makis-resolve"></a>2: Shidou Maki&#x27;s Resolve<a class="hash-link" href="#2-shidou-makis-resolve" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Maki:</strong> Excuse me, Yukari-sama. It&#x27;s Shidou Maki. Starting today, I&#x27;ll be in your care as the first seat of the elite guard.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> --Enter.<br>
<strong>Subordinate A:</strong> --GYAAAA-!!<br>
<strong>Subordinate B:</strong> Somebody... Somebody, help me!!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Just hold on! I&#x27;ll stop the aradama--<br>
<strong>Subordinate C:</strong> Shidou-san! It&#x27;s too much for you to do anything about! I hate it too, but we need to escape!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> How can you say that!? Those are our comrades at its feet!!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> As the captain, I refuse to leave any of them behind!!<br>
<strong>Subordinate C:</strong> Please, get a hold of yourself!! With the way that aradama struck them down, it&#x27;s already too late for them!!<br>
<strong>Subordinate C:</strong> If you don&#x27;t give the order to retreat now, the whole unit will be wiped out!!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> --Shit!! I&#x27;m supposed to be their captain...!!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> But if I had the strength for it, this never should have happened...!!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> --On that day, many from my unit were badly wounded.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> They had such promising futures, and yet, with no hope of recovery, they had to be retired.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I&#x27;ll never forget the helplessness I felt back then. Not a moment has gone by that it hasn&#x27;t agonized me.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Justice is meaningless without the strength to back it up- Without the power to protect.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> To protect the people at your side. If I can reach that power... I don&#x27;t care if it comes from heaven or hell.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Today, as the first seat of Yukari-sama&#x27;s elite guard, I&#x27;ll allow myself to be injected with noro.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I hate the idea of letting noro in my body, but it&#x27;s better than losing my comrades again. Than seeing the tears that were shed that day again.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Under Yukari-sama, I swear I&#x27;ll purge every last aradama from the face of the earth...!!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="3-makis-lecture"></a>3: Maki&#x27;s Lecture<a class="hash-link" href="#3-makis-lecture" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Maki:</strong> Yume. We need to talk.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> The other day, you were ordered to lead a unit on a mission. But I heard you got carried away in battle and left them on their own?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Without their captain around, your subordinates will fall into chaos. Don&#x27;t forget your duty as their leader.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> But that&#x27;s not my problem! They should all be able to take care of themselves!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> That&#x27;s not what it means to be captain, you know.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I&#x27;ve received some complaints from the toji you worked with. I&#x27;m going to read them now, so pay attention.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> --Captain Tsubakuro abandoned us in the middle of battle chasing an aradama. She didn&#x27;t return for another hour.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> --On top of abandoning us, Captain Tsubakuro did not respond to our attempts to contact her. It was difficult to continue without being given orders.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> --Please, Captain Tsubakuro, I&#x27;m begging you. Don&#x27;t go running off with aradama you don&#x27;t know.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Well of course I didn&#x27;t know that aradama! I don&#x27;t know any aradama!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Besides, those girls are way too needy~! If the captain&#x27;s gone, then everyone can just be their own captain!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> YOU COMPLETE IDIOT!!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Hya!?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ...Even I&#x27;ve put people in danger by pushing too far ahead.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> But that&#x27;s no excuse not to reflect on your mistakes. Don&#x27;t try to pass your responsibility onto them.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> If you&#x27;re going to keep putting your unit in danger, then you won&#x27;t be assigned missions anymore.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> You always say you want everyone to remember how amazing you are, but at this rate they&#x27;ll only remember you as a failure.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> No! I don&#x27;t want that!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ...Everyone already knows just how strong you are, Yume. You should show them what a capable leader you can be too!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> ...Oh... I got it!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Then, next time I&#x27;m in charge, I&#x27;ll fight all the aradama myself! Then they&#x27;ll see how capable I am!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> It&#x27;s hard to even call that a unit at this point...  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="4-the-overworking-subordinate"></a>4: The Overworking Subordinate<a class="hash-link" href="#4-the-overworking-subordinate" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Watanuki Kazumi:</strong> --Maki-sama. I&#x27;ve finished writing the report you entrusted me with. Would you like to go over it?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Of course. Sorry to keep relying on you like this.<br>
<strong>Kazumi:</strong> Think nothing of it. In fact, I&#x27;m grateful you would let me work on something Yukari-sama herself would read.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ......Hmm. Alright, I&#x27;m done. It&#x27;s very well written.<br>
<strong>Kazumi:</strong> Of course. After you assigned it to me, I wouldn&#x27;t settle for anything less than perfect.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Thanks. You&#x27;re so reliable, Kazumi.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ...By the way, I couldn&#x27;t help but notice the bags under your eyes. Did you have to stay up late working on this?<br>
<strong>Kazumi:</strong> Please, pay it no mind. I only went one night without sleeping.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> You pulled an all-nighter!? There&#x27;s not much left to do today, so please, go back to your room and sleep.<br>
<strong>Kazumi:</strong> No, I wouldn&#x27;t have had to stay up all night if not for my inexperience.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ...Kazumi, don&#x27;t overwork yourself. It&#x27;s a bad habit of yours to push yourself harder than you have to.<br>
<strong>Kazumi:</strong> No, I can still--<br>
<strong>Kazumi:</strong> (I have to give everything I can. It&#x27;s the only way I can be useful to Maki-sama...)<br>
<strong>Kazumi:</strong> --We&#x27;ve been called to action. Aradama have appeared, it seems. Maki-sama, let&#x27;s go.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Stay here, Kazumi.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> If you won&#x27;t rest, I&#x27;ll have to punish myself for poorly managing you.<br>
<strong>Kazumi:</strong> You&#x27;d punish yourself over me...<br>
<strong>Kazumi:</strong> I understand. If you insist, I&#x27;ll get some rest... You&#x27;re so kind, Maki-sama.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> You&#x27;re my precious subordinate, after all.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Anyway, I&#x27;m going. You be sure to get some sleep in your room.<br>

Have you seen my phone anywhere?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> It&#x27;s over on the desk.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Ah, you&#x27;re right. I guess I left it in the office.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I can&#x27;t believe you... You&#x27;re too careless. What if someone had taken for some wrongdoing?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Wrongdoing? The only people allowed in here are those authorized by the elite guard.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Ara, but what if I decided to play a prank on you?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> You wouldn&#x27;t do something like that. After all the hardships we&#x27;ve been through together, I know I can count on you.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> --There was that time we were separated from the others and had to fight off aradama together for quite some time, wasn&#x27;t there.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Yeah. We didn&#x27;t even have enough provisions, so we had to share a meal. I remember thinking at the time that, no matter what happened after, I could always trust you to watch my back.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yes. At the time, I also decided you were worth relying on as a fighter and a person.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> --On a somewhat related note. I did play a little prank on you, because of our closeness.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> After all, I know you&#x27;ll forgive me, Maki-san, if I get a little mischievous with you.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> You shouldn&#x27;t abuse someone&#x27;s trust like that...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Fufu. Anyway, are you aware I know the password to your phone?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Eh-!? How!?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> You always hold your phone horizontally, so watching you input it was child&#x27;s play.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I-I didn&#x27;t know you were watching... And hey, isn&#x27;t it common courtesy not to watch someone put their password in?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I mean, I don&#x27;t know your phone&#x27;s password, Suzuka.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> You just aren&#x27;t very observant, Maki-san.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> That&#x27;s still not a good reason...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Anyway, jokes aside, I wanted to show how you never know what risks you may be taking.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> To begin with, an emergency call could come in at any time, so you ought to always keep your phone with you.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ...You have a point there.

<strong>Maki:</strong> Yume, what do you need? I thought you had the day off today.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Don&#x27;t you have it off too, Maki-onee-san? Hey hey-, since we have free time, don&#x27;t you want to play a game together?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> A game?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Some toji onee-sans made a VR game in their lab, and people are saying it&#x27;s super fun.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> VR... I think I&#x27;ll have to turn you down this time.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh, you should go-. They said it&#x27;s really easy to play too, so you&#x27;ll be fine even though you&#x27;re dumb with technology, Maki-onee-san.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I-I wasn&#x27;t worried about that...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Then, Maki-san, since you have this opportunity on your day off, why not go and play with Yume?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ...Doesn&#x27;t seem like I have much of a choice. If you don&#x27;t mind me acting as a chaperone, then I&#x27;ll go.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Yaay! I get to go out with Maki-onee-san! That makes me happy. Let&#x27;s get going then-!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I&#x27;m surprised to see two of the elite guard arrive. It might be unexpected, but I&#x27;m glad you&#x27;re here. I&#x27;ll have two stations ready for you right away.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Hang on a minute, I&#x27;m only here to chaperone her.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh-, but we&#x27;re already here, so you should just do it too, Maki-onee-san-!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> But...<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> If you&#x27;re concerned with the safety of it, you have nothing to worry about. Fighting within the game should be safer than your ordinary battles with aradama.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Well, I can&#x27;t argue with that...<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> By the way, we&#x27;re currently hosting an event. Whoever can score highest in the battle stage will be given a prize of cream puffs from a popular store.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ahh! That&#x27;s that store Suzuka-onee-san loves, isn&#x27;t it! Hey hey, Maki-onee-san, if you win, then won&#x27;t Suzuka-onee-san be really happy?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> You should play for Suzuka-onee-san too-.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ...I guess, if I have to. Fine, if I&#x27;m doing this, then I&#x27;ll aim for the top!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Hooray-! Let&#x27;s try our best, Maki-onee-san!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> There, now everything is ready... Hm? Shidou-san, why are you holding your okatana?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Since I&#x27;m going to a strange world fighting unknown enemies, I want to take every precaution.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I see. Though, in this game, you&#x27;ll be battling with laser guns, so your okatana won&#x27;t be necessary... But, if it gives you peace of mind, that&#x27;s okay.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Now then, let&#x27;s start the game. Take care.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Wow-! So this is the game world! The city&#x27;s all pretty and shiny!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Let&#x27;s go on the roof of that building! Juuump!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Yume, wait for me! Okay, I&#x27;ll do it too... EII!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> This is amazing! The game world improved our jumping ability by this much. I can leap from building to building like I were using hachimanriki.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Maki-onee-san! Let&#x27;s go up to the top of that tower!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Sure, let&#x27;s go!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Ahh, the city skyline at night really is beautiful. I wish Suzuka and them could be here to see this...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ...Huh? Yume? Yume, where did you go?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> We must have gotten separated while I was looking at the skyline.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Heeey, Yume! Where are you? If you&#x27;re hiding, then say something! Yume-!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ...No use. She&#x27;s not responding. Ban Tsugumi said it was safe here, but it&#x27;s still too dangerous to explore an unknown world on your own.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I need to calm down and deal with the situation. At times like this, you need to...  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="vrs-equipment---maki-end-what-suits-me-best"></a>[VRS Equipment - Maki: End]: What Suits Me Best<a class="hash-link" href="#vrs-equipment---maki-end-what-suits-me-best" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Maki:</strong> Heeey, Yume! Where did you go? Say something back. Yume-!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Hm, that sound. The battle stage must be starting. If I follow the enemies, maybe I&#x27;ll join up with Yume. I&#x27;ll focus on the battle for now.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> If I remember right, the command to bring out the laser gun was... Okay, I got it. Now I just point it at the enemies on the opposite building...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Kh, why can&#x27;t I pull the trigger!? The command to pull the trigger was...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Ah-- While I was working with it, the enemies got right in front of me! Damn, how should I...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Ah--! That&#x27;s right, I still have that, don&#x27;t I! It might be tasteless of me to use my okatana in the game, but...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Here I come! SERYAAAAAAAAAAAAA!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Good! I can defeat them with my okatana too. I&#x27;ll keep this up and wipe them out! HAAAAAAHH!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh-- Hey, Maki-onee-san?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Yume! That&#x27;s good, you&#x27;re safe! I&#x27;ll finish them all off in a minute! HAAAAAAHH!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Come on-, Maki-onee-san! It&#x27;s a game, so fight with your laser gun already-.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> An okatana seems to be what suits me best after all. Alright, this should finish them! YAAAAAAHH!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Alright, battle stage clear. Good work, Yume.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I wasn&#x27;t working at all-. You beat them all by yourself out of nowhere, Maki-onee-san.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I see, sorry about that. Anyway, how about we enjoy a look around the city now?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Okay!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Welcome back. Did you two have a good time?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Yeah! Maki-onee-san beat everything in the battle stage first, so I didn&#x27;t get to do anything, but it was a lot of fun jumping around between the buildings-.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> It was. The virtual world was more detailed than I imagined, and it was satisfying seeing every nook and cranny of the city.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> That&#x27;s good to hear. Now then, as all challengers have finished their runs, the results of the battle stage will now be revealed.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Maki-onee-san beat them all straight away, so there&#x27;s no way she didn&#x27;t take first place!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> That&#x27;s right, I got serious hoping for that. Let&#x27;s see the rankings.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> What!? We came in last place!?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Eh-!? But why? We should&#x27;ve been first in beating the most enemies and beating them fastest. Why are we last-?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> At first, I was just as perplexed as to why you two didn&#x27;t earn any points in the battle...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> When investigating the cause, we came to the conclusion that there was a problem with how you defeated the enemies.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Did you use something besides the laser gun to defeat them?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Kh... So you don&#x27;t get any points for defeating them with okatana...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> We&#x27;re back-!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Welcome back, the two of you. Oh, Maki-san, what&#x27;s the matter? That&#x27;s an awfully gloomy look on your face.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> You still can&#x27;t get over that we lost, Maki-onee-san? Cheer up, okay-.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Th-That&#x27;s not it. It&#x27;s just... I planned on coming back with Suzuka&#x27;s favorite cream puffs, but instead...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Well now, is that why you&#x27;re in such low spirits. Fufu. Maki-san, please lift up your head.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I would be happy to have those cream puffs, but your feelings alone are enough to satisfy me.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Suzuka...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Next time, I&#x27;d like for all of us to go play that game together.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Right, sure thing. By that time, I&#x27;ll master my way around a laser gun.  </p><div class="videoWrapper"><iframe width="640" height="480" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WNtGgHguxrw"></iframe></div><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="sddt---maki-start-maki-of-the-special-defense-team"></a>[SDDT - Maki: Start]: Maki of the Special Defense Team<a class="hash-link" href="#sddt---maki-start-maki-of-the-special-defense-team" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Maki:</strong> Hmph! ...Hmph!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ah, I finally found you, Maki-onee-san!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ...Nn? What do you need, Yume?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Is it true you&#x27;re going on a trip alone together with Suzuka-onee-san? Why am I the only one who has to stay behind! It&#x27;s boring here!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Who told you something that misleading... We&#x27;re not going on a trip; we&#x27;re suppressing aradama.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> That sounds even funner! You two get to do all the good stuff!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Don&#x27;t act so spoiled, Yume. With us having only just been reorganized into the Special Defense Team, we&#x27;re short on hands.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> We can&#x27;t afford to neglect our duty to guard the Origami family and escort Akane-sama. Do you understand what I&#x27;m saying?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> ...Well, if I have to-.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> But you better buy me a souvenir!! Get me an Ichigo Daifuku Neko they sell there!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Got it. I&#x27;ll buy you one, so long as I don&#x27;t forget.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Why the troubled face? How about you have a drink of tea and relax?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I&#x27;ll take it...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> You don&#x27;t have to be so nervous. This will go fine. We only have to do it like we normally do.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I&#x27;m not feeling nervous. It&#x27;s just...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Just?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> It&#x27;s just a little hard to calm down.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Doesn&#x27;t that mean you&#x27;re getting nervous?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ...Maybe. I guess you&#x27;re right.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> That&#x27;s how you are, Maki-san.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> It&#x27;s because we can&#x27;t stop for anything until we atone for the past.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> You aren&#x27;t entirely wrong to think that way, but... If you obsess over it, you&#x27;ll only be making yourself suffer, alright?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I know that, but, still.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> You&#x27;re very serious, Maki-san.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> That&#x27;s just how I am; I can&#x27;t help it.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> By the way... Do you think they sell Ichigo Daifuku Nekos where the mission is taking place?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Did Yume ask about it?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Seems like she wants a souvenir.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Of course she would.

<strong>Maki:</strong> There&#x27;s more of them than I was expecting... Was it a mistake to split up from Suzuka...?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> It speeds up the rate we deal with them, but...!<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> OOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> YAAAH!!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Damn, I can&#x27;t even get time to catch my breath.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> More of them are still coming...?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> The situation&#x27;ll just keep getting worse as it is. I&#x27;ll regroup with Suzuka so we can rethink our strategy.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> [pant, pant]... These numbers may be too much after all.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I should regroup with Maki-san for now...<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> OOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Kh... For me to have let my guard down here...!!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> So I&#x27;m surrounded then...<br>

<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Maki-san...?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Can you stand? Are you hurt?<br>

<strong>Maki:</strong> Though?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> For you to arrive with such perfect timing to rescue me... I&#x27;m a bit bewildered is all.<br>

<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Maki-san? Why the troubled face?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Oh, Suzuka.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> There&#x27;s a lot of toji using VR for training lately, right?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> It seems that way.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> It&#x27;s good broaden people&#x27;s options for training. But... I&#x27;m wondering if there&#x27;s anything else we can use VR for.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Suzuka?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I just never expected to hear that from someone as technologically inept as you.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I&#x27;ll admit I&#x27;m a little bad when it comes to using gadgets. But, it&#x27;s impressive, wasn&#x27;t it?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> So it just crossed my mind.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I do agree it&#x27;s an interesting idea. I&#x27;ll see if I can think of anything too.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> A PV?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yes. A promotional video for toji, with a play staged in VR.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> A play...?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I called it that, but we won&#x27;t actually be acting out roles.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Something more of a staged sword fight, you could call it.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> When I consulted with Ban-san, she said it would be feasible, so long as she recorded the fighting and edited the footage.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> So she just needs us to fight then... Alright, that plan sounds good.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> We should be able to make it happen.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I&#x27;ve already given Ban-san the go ahead.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> You always get things rolling. Let&#x27;s go see Ban Tsugumi then.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Come to visit?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Yeah. Is everything coming along?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I have it ready for you.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Just for a test, the current configuration is set to &quot;Journey to the West&quot;; will that be an issue?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Not at all.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> We just need to play characters from Journey to the West, right?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> That&#x27;s the case.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Were there any you wanted to play in particular? If not, I can assign you to what fits.<br>

<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I&#x27;m fine as well.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Then, I&#x27;ll introduce enemies. They&#x27;ll begin moving as soon as you start, so please bear that in mind.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Sure, we&#x27;ve got it.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Alright, let&#x27;s start...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> One thing before that, Maki-san. Should we go over how we plan to fight?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> How? Aren&#x27;t we going to fight like normal?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> There wouldn&#x27;t be much appeal in that. Given that we&#x27;re in VR, I think we should use this opportunity to fight differently.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Differently from normal...<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> If I can collect different combat data than your ordinary battles, I&#x27;d very much welcome that too.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Alright, I&#x27;ll try coming up with something. How about, using the buildings to fight?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Suzuka.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> To move about three-dimensionally? It sounds interesting.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> We&#x27;re going to move up to the top of this building, so start whenever you feel the timing&#x27;s right.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Yoh, hoh!<br>

<strong>Maki:</strong> Spotted the enemy! Suzuka!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Maki-san!?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> HAAAH!!<br>
<strong>Villain:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Maki-san, you&#x27;re moving around too haphazardly...<br>

<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Did it give you any nausea?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> My vision&#x27;s spinning around... I think I might be a little motion sick.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Ban-san, let&#x27;s take a short break.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I&#x27;ve finished recording the fight scene as we planned.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> This here is a sample of it. Please watch over it to decide whether or not we should make a PV from it.<br>

<strong>Yume:</strong> Oh, okay.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Thinking about what Yomi likes, there&#x27;s omusubi, but...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Then, can&#x27;t we just go with a rice cake?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> A rice cake... That&#x27;s true; with a name like that, Yomi&#x27;d probably like it.<br>

<strong>Maki:</strong> Rice cakes aren&#x27;t actually cakes!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> That&#x27;s right, they aren&#x27;t?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ...You knew about that?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yes. If you look up the word rice cake, you&#x27;ll find mochi...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> That isn&#x27;t what you ordered, is it, Maki-san?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Yeah. What I got was something like puffed up rice in a disc shape.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> That sounds about right.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Honestly, why would you order something like that?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I thought it&#x27;d make Yomi happy, as a Christmas cake...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> What am I going to do with you.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Rice cakes are something you can eat like crackers.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> All we can do now is prepare a different cake for Yomi-san&#x27;s birthday.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Fortunately, we still have time to spare.<br>

<strong>Ellen:</strong> Yes! It&#x27;s been my favorite lately!<br>

<strong>Ellen:</strong> Anyone would be happy with whatever someone tried so hard to pick out for them.<br>

<strong>Maki:</strong> An ambush...? This platoon maneuvers training only just started though!?<br>
<strong>Toji B:</strong> Still, we&#x27;ve confirmed it! We tried sending backup immediately, but by the time they got there, they were already unable to fight!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Kgh...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> (Did Suzuka predict the orders I&#x27;d give? Then that&#x27;d mean...)<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> It&#x27;s dangerous staying here too... We&#x27;re moving!<br>

<strong>Toji A:</strong> I&#x27;m sorry, Shidou-san; we just weren&#x27;t strong enough for them...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ...No, none of you did anything wrong. They were just one step ahead of us.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> (I never thought she&#x27;d have such a good read on me...)<br>
<strong>Toji A:</strong> There&#x27;s only me and a few others left... What should we do?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> (Regrouping from this would be almost impossible... All that&#x27;s left is...)<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I&#x27;ll go out there. We&#x27;re just too outnumbered right now... I&#x27;m the only one who could this around.<br>
<strong>Toji A:</strong> Alright... Good luck out there, Shidou-san.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Thanks!<br>
<strong>???:</strong> Shidou Maki started moving independently from the rest.<br>
<strong>???:</strong> Just as expected. Mm, I knew you wouldn&#x27;t be able to resist.<br>
<strong>???:</strong> Is everyone ready and waiting?<br>
<strong>???:</strong> Yes.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...This is checkmate, Maki-san.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Now then, let&#x27;s begin the review meeting for our platoon skirmish.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ...I got outmatched so badly I can&#x27;t even tell what I&#x27;m supposed to review.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Could you tell everything I was thinking, Suzuka?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> From your past tendencies, I could tell you would bring your platoon at us from the front.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Given our different approaches to leadership, if our platoons were to face each other so directly, I would be at a disadvantage.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> So that&#x27;s why you went with an ambush.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yes; if I wanted to win, our best plan of action was to come at you from where you were most exposed.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> You had me completely caught up in it. Especially with how well you pulled off those last waves of attacks.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> That was the cornerstone to our strategy. I wouldn&#x27;t be exaggerating to say everything else was simply to bring you to that point.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ...So you knew I&#x27;d do all that?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> That&#x27;s right. When your unit finds itself in danger, you always attempt to recover the situation on your own, don&#x27;t you?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ...Do I? Wait, now that I think about it, maybe you&#x27;re right...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...We&#x27;ll have to put this review meeting on hold here.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Right... Let&#x27;s move out, Suzuka!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="misogi---maki-end-somebody-i-cant-beat"></a>[Misogi - Maki: End]: Somebody I Can&#x27;t Beat<a class="hash-link" href="#misogi---maki-end-somebody-i-cant-beat" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Suzuka:</strong> It seems we&#x27;ll already be able to put today&#x27;s training to good use.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Today&#x27;s training...? You think we&#x27;ll have to watch out for any aradama ambushes?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Well, I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s completely out of the question, would you?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...We&#x27;re just about to make contact.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Why are there so many!?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> This could take quite some time...<br>
<strong>Toji A:</strong> HAAAAAAAAAAAA!!<br>
<strong>Toji A:</strong> Damnit! After every one we kill, another one comes out!<br>
<strong>Toji B:</strong> How long is this going to go on for...?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> (...They&#x27;re already showing signs of fatigue. At this point, I should...)<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> That&#x27;s right. When your unit finds itself in danger, you always attempt to recover the situation on your own, don&#x27;t you?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> (...If I did that, there&#x27;d be no point to the training... But, still...)<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...It&#x27;s getting to be rather difficult, isn&#x27;t it.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ...Yeah. Everybody&#x27;s close to their limit.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> What should we do about them...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> (If we keep fighting like this... we might get overwhelmed by their numbers.)<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> (And then, what&#x27;s going to happen to these girls?)<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> (If that&#x27;s going to put them in danger... I just have to do whatever I can!)<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Suzuka!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yes?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I&#x27;m leaving my unit with you! You&#x27;ll take good care of them, right?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Fufu, how very like you, Maki-san.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Yeah, it doesn&#x27;t seem like I can do much else. So... I&#x27;m heading off.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> HAAAAAAAAAAAAAHH!!<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> GEEEEEEEEE!!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> We somehow managed though all that.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ...Sorry, Suzuka.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> What are you apologizing for?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Many girls were injured, but none of it was serious. And they all owe it to you.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Still, I ended up going off on my own in the end. That made the whole training meaningless.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> It&#x27;s true that you should reflect on that, from the perspective of preparing the next generation.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> But, to use yourself as a shield to protect those by your side... I think that&#x27;s one of your best qualities, Maki-san.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> You... do?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I do. So, why not learn to operate your unit in your own way?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Hmph! Hmph! Hmhh! Hmph! Huph--!!!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> (Operate in my own way... Since I have the day off and I&#x27;m done training, I might as well go through some simulations.)<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> You&#x27;re out here training again? Don&#x27;t you think you ought to take the time to rest every so often?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Hey, you&#x27;re the one who said I should keep doing things my own way.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I&#x27;m not busy today, so I&#x27;m going to really think over how to lead around a unit.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Honestly... This is exactly what&#x27;s no good about you, Maki-san.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Weren&#x27;t you telling me the exact opposite before!?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> That was then, this is now.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> So go on, shower yourself off. After you&#x27;ve finished, you can come along with me to an art gallery.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ...I really can&#x27;t hold a candle to you, can I.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations/edit/docs/episodes/Shidou_Maki_Episodes.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_2_ui" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_3DPF"></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/tnm-translations/docs/episodes/Origami_Yukari_Episodes/"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Â« Origami Yukari Episodes</div></a></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/tnm-translations/docs/episodes/Konohana_Suzuka_Episodes/"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Next</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Konohana Suzuka Episodes Â»</div></a></div></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_35-E thin-scrollbar"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#1-the-charismatic-toji" class="table-of-contents__link">1: The Charismatic Toji</a></li><li><a href="#2-shidou-makis-resolve" class="table-of-contents__link">2: Shidou Maki&#39;s Resolve</a></li><li><a href="#3-makis-lecture" class="table-of-contents__link">3: Maki&#39;s Lecture</a></li><li><a href="#4-the-overworking-subordinate" class="table-of-contents__link">4: The Overworking Subordinate</a></li><li><a href="#5-absolute-trust" class="table-of-contents__link">5: Absolute Trust</a></li><li><a href="#vrs-equipment---maki-start-just-to-be-sure" class="table-of-contents__link">VRS Equipment - Maki: Start: Just to Be Sure</a></li><li><a href="#vrs-equipment---maki-end-what-suits-me-best" class="table-of-contents__link">VRS Equipment - Maki: End: What Suits Me Best</a></li><li><a href="#sddt---maki-start-maki-of-the-special-defense-team" class="table-of-contents__link">SDDT - Maki: Start: Maki of the Special Defense Team</a></li><li><a href="#sddt---maki-end-like-a-hero" class="table-of-contents__link">SDDT - Maki: End: Like a Hero</a></li><li><a href="#journey-to-the-west---maki-start-a-different-way-of-using-it" class="table-of-contents__link">Journey to the West - Maki: Start: A Different Way of Using It</a></li><li><a href="#journey-to-the-west---maki-end-well-all-do-it-next-time" class="table-of-contents__link">Journey to the West - Maki: End: We&#39;ll All Do It Next Time</a></li><li><a href="#xmas-20---maki-start-looking-for-a-christmas-cake" class="table-of-contents__link">Xmas' 20 - Maki: Start: Looking for a Christmas Cake</a></li><li><a href="#xmas-20---maki-start-with-a-special-someone" class="table-of-contents__link">Xmas' 20 - Maki: Start: With a Special Someone</a></li><li><a href="#misogi---maki-start-makis-habit" class="table-of-contents__link">Misogi - Maki: Start: Maki&#39;s Habit</a></li><li><a href="#misogi---maki-end-somebody-i-cant-beat" class="table-of-contents__link">Misogi - Maki: End: Somebody I Can&#39;t Beat</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Links</div><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://pastebin.com/LdyviZ8Z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Translator anon&#x27;s pastebin<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Site source code<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Built with Docusaurus.</div></div></div></footer></div>
