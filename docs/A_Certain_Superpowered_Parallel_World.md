## Creation Experiment (Trial)
**Shirai Kuroko:** That reminds me, Onee-sama. I've heard you'll soon be helping with an experiment to create a new type of metal. Is that true?  
**Misaka Mikoto:** Ah, yeah. I'm surprised you knew.  
**Kuroko:** I didn't think you interested in those experiments normally.  
**Mikoto:** Well, it's fine every once in a while.  
**Mikoto:** (There's no way I can tell her I got roped in because this company makes collab novelty Gekota merchandise that they don't sell anywhere...)  
**Konori Mii:** What will they be having you do, Misaka-san?  
**Mikoto:** They need a fixed electric current... They asked me to provide an electromagnetic wave. An especially strong one.  
**Saten Ruiko:** That sounds like it could be kinda interesting. Can we go along to see?  
**Mikoto:** Sure, I think that'll be fine?  
**Uiharu Kazari:** Saten-san, didn't you say you'd be busy gathering gossip about that urban legend that there's a door to another world hidden in some school district?  
**Ruiko:** It's fine, it's fine. Urban legends aren't going anywhere!  
## Visitors (Gallery)  
**Mikoto:** HAAAA...!  
**Ruiko:** That's as incredible of an electric shock as ever, Misaka-san.  
**Kazari:** I wonder what the theory is behind creating a new type of metal using electricity, anyway?  
**Ruiko:** Beats me? I'm not all that interested in that stuff.  
**Kazari:** Then... Why did you go and say we should come along?  
**Ruiko:** Doesn't it sound kinda crazy that they're making a new type of metal? That's why, if we're doing it, I want to be there, you know?  
**Mii:** It's good to have lots of interests. There's nothing wrong with those kind of motivations.  
**Mikoto:** It really is easier getting into the experiment having you all here, as opposed to being surrounded by people I don't know.  
**Mikoto:** So, I'm glad you came.  
**Kuroko:** My very existence... Thinking of that as the source of Onee-sama's strength isn't so bad.  
**Mikoto:** Kuroko... Couldn't you have phrased that better?  
**Kuroko:** I have only stated the truth.  
**Shokuhou Misaki:** Honestly... Thanks to you, Misaka-san, the static electricity is making my hair act funny. What a bother.  
**Mikoto:** Shokuhou Misaki...! What are you doing here!?  
**Misaki:** Hmm-, just to see the sights?  
**Mikoto:** Whatever... If you're going to complain, then just go. I have to do the main experiment in a minute.  
**Mii:** Are you two, "friendly enough to fight"?  
**Both:** It's not like that at all!  

## 1: Our First Aradama Experience
**Mikoto:** Ughh... My eyes are stinging. Is everyone okay?  
**Kazari:** Yes... I'm just fine. Are you alright, Saten-san?  
**Ruiko:** Somehow-.  
**Misaki:** Hang onn, thanks to Misaka-san, my eyes are still burning here?  
**Misaki:** Depending on if this clears up, I might have to file a complaint~.  
**Mikoto:** How is this my fault? All I did was go along with their experiment to create a new kind of metal.  
**Mikoto:** Saten-san and Uiharu-san are okay too, so you should be fine...  
**Mikoto:** Actually, where are Kuroko and Konori-senpai at?  
**Kuroko:** The Kuroko you seek is right here, Onee-sama! And, just as you want me, I can be locked in your arms once more!  
**Mikoto:** As if!!  
**Mii:** Shirai-san. Isn't there something we should tell them first?  
**Kuroko:** I suppose...  
**Mikoto:** Did something bad happen?  
**Kuroko:** Your vision still hasn't returned to normal, so you may not have noticed, but... This isn't where the experiment was taking place.  
**Ruiko:** Eh... Then, where are we? Uiharu, can you look it up?  
**Kazari:** Just... give me a minute. Huh, I can't get it to turn on!?  
**Mikoto:** Let's just ask someone around here then.  
**Mikoto:** Excuse me--  
**Screaming People:** UWAAHHHHH, ARADAMA!? G-GET OUT OF HERE!!  
**Mikoto:** Eh... Wait...  
**Misaki:** Maybe it would have been for the best if someone besides Misaka-san had asked them?  
**Mikoto:** ...I didn't even do anything!  
**Mii:** More importantly, "aradama"? I'm curious what that means.  
**Ruiko:** Umm... This is totally just going off my intuition here, but! Maybe they meant that!?  
**Aradama:** ...GUOOOOOOOHHH!  
**Mikoto:** Geez... And what's this, this weird thing! Let's go, Kuroko. Help me out.  
**Kuroko:** Of course, I'll be right with you, Onee-sama.  
**Misaki:** Do your bestt. It's times like these we need that barbaric power of yours, Misaka-sann.  
**Mai:** --What do you think about that? I think it would improve the circumstances of toji waiting for aradama to appear.  
**Maki:** I see. You make a good point, Yanase.  
**Mirja:** Sorry to interrupt your meeting.  
**Maki:** Kitora? Did you need something?  
**Mirja:** This information is still unverified, but we've received a report that a group of citizens are fighting with aradama.  
**Mai:** Eh!?  
**Mirja:** As time was of the essence, Etou Kanami, Mashiko Kaoru, Setouchi Chie, Shichinosato Kofuki, and Iwakura Sanae have been sent to the scene.  
**Maki:** Ordinary citizens, fighting aradama; I can hardly believe it. ...Is there something strange going on? Just to be sure, we should go too.  
**Kanami:** Still, why would they fight and not run away?  
**Kofuki:** Seriously; those're my aradama-chan.  
**Kaoru:** It's probably just some idiots wanting to test their courage. It happens every now and then.  
**Sanae:** Whatever it is, we have to get there soon!  
**Chie:** I can hear an aradama roaring. It's just up ahead!  
**Kanami:** Whoa, why's the air all crackly!?  
**Aradama:** GUGIII...!  
**Kuroko:** Onee-sama-! It's getting up once again!  
**Mikoto:** Seriously... Just how stubborn can they be! I'm going to hit it one more time!  
**Sanae:** That's dangerous; please get back!  
**Mikoto:** Huh?  
**Kanami:** We'll take care of the rest here!  
**Kofuki:** Out of my way! Those're all mine--!  
**Kuroko:** Er... Who might you be? You aren't from Judgement, are you?  
**Kaoru:** Judgement? We're toji.  
**Mikoto:** "Toji"? What's that?  
**Chie:** (...They don't know what toji are?)  
**Chie:** Putting it simply, we're something like experts at suppressing those aradama you're fighting.  
**Ruiko:** Sorry, we found a lost girl and took her with us, but what should we do about her?  
**Mii:** Also, we weren't able to access the database to check evacuation guidelines, and we were in trouble since we couldn't call for help.  
**Chie:** I understand. I'll call someone to help then.  
**Kaoru:** Well, until help shows up, I'll guide her to somewhere safe the aradama can't get to.  
**Chie:** Thank you, Kaoru-san. The rest of you should all hurry to safety as well!  
**Kazari:** Why is it that they all have swords... They don't seem like some special tool for an ability enhancement test, do they?  
**Kuroko:** Though, it looks as if they're telling the truth when they say they're specialists.  
**Aradama:** GYAAAAAAAA...!  
**Kofuki:** Hey, hey, what's wrong? You're not gonna satisfy me like that!  
**Sanae:** Etou-san, I'll drive them over your way!  
**Kanami:** Sure, I'm ready whenever!  
**Kanami:** HAAA--!  
**Maki:** Etou, Mashiko, Iwakura, Shichinosato, Setouchi. Good work on making it here quickly and suppressing them. And then... You girls.  
**Yume:** They're kinda weird, aren't they? They don't know about toji or aradama.  
**Ruiko:** That was so cool, the way you were like, whoosh, with your swords! Girls with Japanese swords just have that appeal to them, don't they-.  
**Kazari:** Saten-san, before you go off like that, we should make sure of what those aradama things were first.  
**Mai:** Well, thinking over it, aradama are a sort of false organism created from a fusion of noro, I guess?  
**Mai:** Without using the okatana we toji fight with, you won't be able to exorcise them. No matter what you attack them with.  
**Mikoto:** So that's why they kept coming back every time I hit them with electric shocks.  
**Kuroko:** Still, for Onee-sama, the electromaster, boasted as third rank in Academy City, to be unable to defeat them...  
**Mikoto:** There are still some people my esper powers don't work on... Very very few of them though.  
**Kanami:** Esper powers? You mean like, you can use telepathy or control fire, like you see in movies or manga?  
**Mikoto:** What are you talking about? It's common knowledge that Academy City is working to develop esper powers.  
**Mirja:** Academy City... Development of esper powers. I find this hard to believe all of a sudden.  
**Mii:** Toji, and aradama... It seems there are many things we're both unfamiliar with. Perhaps we should start by confirming some things with each other.  
**Ruiko:** Ah, before that, shouldn't we do the easy thing and all introduce ourselves? If we don't, it'll get confusing while we're talking.  
**Ruiko:** I'm Saten Ruiko, a first year in Sakugawa Middle School! Nice to meet you! Okay, now Misaka-san!  
**Mikoto:** I'm Misaka Mikoto. A second year in Tokiwadai Middle School. Nice to meet you.  
**Misaki:** Likewise, second year at Tokiwadai Middle School, Shokuhou Misaki. Misaka-san and I are verrry close~. Good to meet you all~.  
**Mikoto:** Since when... Could you at least do your introduction right?  
**Misaki:** Awww, Misaka-san's so scaryy.  
**Kanami:** So you two come from the same school. I'm Etou Kanami, a second year in the Minoseki Academy's middle school division. Nice to meet you!  
**Kuruko:** Then, I will go next. I am Shirai Kuroko, a first year from Tokiwadai Middle School. And a member of one of Academy City's organizations for maintaining public order, Judgement.  
**Kuroko:** Ah-! I can't believe myself; I nearly forgot to mention something important.  
**Kuroko:** I also happen to be Misaka Mikoto-onee-sama's roommate at Tokiwadai's dorms. Pleased to make your acquaintance.  
**Kazari:** ...Leave it to Shirai-san to go out of her way to let people know that.  
**Kazari:** Ah. My name is Uiharu Kazari. I'm a member of Judgment, the same as Shirai-san, and also, a classmate of Saten-san's.  
**Mii:** Then, it looks like I'm the last one on our side. I'm Konori Mii. Good to meet you.  
**Mii:** Like Shirai-san and Uiharu-san, I work for Judgement.  
**Mii:** Oh, and, come to think of it, I'm the only one in high school among us.  
**Kazari:** She's our dependable senpai.  
**Mii:** Thank you, Uiharu-san.  
**Mirja:** Then, we should finish our introductions as well. I'm Kitora Mirja, second year in the high school division of Ayanokouji Martial Arts School.  

## 2: Tamahagane?
**Mikoto:** With my power, it's like this.  
**Yume:** That's so cool, Onee-san! It's all sparky and crackly!  
**Kaoru:** They really do have esper powers.  
**Kuroko:** Still, now things are finally clear. This may sound unbelievable, but... We've all arrived in a world without Academy City or esper abilities.  
**Mii:** I'm sorry to ask for this, but is there any way you could provide for us a place to live for the time being?  
**Maki:** Of course. I'm sure you don't have anyone else to rely on, so we'll arrange a place for you to stay at the nearby Renpu dorms. You don't have to worry.  
**Mikoto:** Thanks a lot. That really helps.  
**Chie:** Anyway, Shidou-san. Everyone must be tired, so let's move over there.  
**Mirja:** Now then, could you explain what it was you were all doing just before you came here?  
**Mikoto:** Just before we ended up in this world, I was actually helping with an experiment to create a new kind of metal.  
**Mikoto:** And then, after I made electric current, in just 10 seconds, we were blanketed in this white light...  
**Kuroko:** The next thing we knew, we had been transported to this world.  
**Kaoru:** I guess what sounds reasonable is, this metal you were trying to make might've been the cause?  
**Kaoru:** What kind of metal was it?  
**Mikoto:** Sorry, I don't know the details myself...  
**Mikoto:** (And that's cause, after they said they'd give me corporate novelty Gekota merchandise... I got too excited and wasn't listening.)  
**Misaki:** If only Misaka-san would pay more attention to that sort of thingg.  
**Misaki:** That side of you can be so childish; it's a real botherr.  
**Mikoto:** Wha!? Listen, you... I do feel a little responsible for this, but... Why'd you even have to come along in the first place!  
**Misaki:** Purely by chance. I just happened to have something to take care of at that research institute too.  
**Mirja:** Misaka Mikoto, Shokuhou Misaki. We are getting off topic. Is there anything else you can remember?  
**Mikoto:** Ah, come to think of it, the metal we were creating, I think they gave it the temporary name "Tamahagane"...  
**Chie:** Eh, tamahagane?  
**Mikoto:** ...Wait, huh? Is there something about tamahagane?  
**Chie:** It might be a simple coincidence, but our okatana are made from a special iron sand known as tamahagane.  
**Chie:** It's a word we're a little used to hearing, so I couldn't help but react.  
**Kazari:** That sure is an interesting coincidence though.  
**Maki:** Mind if I butt in for a moment? Looking over the report from the noro recovery team just now, there's a detail I'd better tell you about.  
**Maki:** From the sound of things, they found an unidentified metal mixed in with the samples of noro, though only in small quantities.  
**Mikoto:** Then... Does that mean what I think it does?  
**Maki:** It's not at the point we can speculate yet, but it is concerning.  
**Mai:** In that case, why don't we have Ellen-san ask Friedman-san and the Special Rare Metals Utilization Research Institute to look into it?  
**Mai:** This metal mixed in with the noro might be just what Misaka-san is talking about, after all.  
**Kaoru:** It's best to leave what you don't get to the professionals.  
**Misaki:** What's the harm in asking? If they send it back to us, we can't do very much investigation ourselves, can we?  
**Mikoto:** That's right; we'll follow any clues we can get. You're all okay with that, aren't you?  
**Mii:** I think that's the best option we have available now.  
**Mai:** Then, I'll get in touch with her right away.  
**Maki:** I'll get the procedures taken care of then, so the noro can be transported smoothly.  
**Sanae:** In the meantime, everyone, would you like to have dinner? With all that's happened, I figure you must be hungry.  
**Ruiko:** Ah-, that'd be great. I was starving, actually.  

## 3: Toji are Highly Busy
Several days had passed since Mikoto and the others came to this world.  
They offered to help gather from the aradama the tamahagane metal that their experiment had created.

  
**Aradama:** GGGIIIII...!!  
**Mikoto:** Don't go running wild in the middle of town!  
**Aradama:** Gu... Gguu...  
**Mai:** The aradama's movements have slowed. Let's finish it off, Iwakura-san!  
**Sanae:** Understood! --HAAAAAH!  
**Aradama:** ......  
**Kuroko:** What excellent coordination.  
**Sanae:** Thanks for the help, Misaka-san.  
**Mikoto:** You're welcome, but, I didn't do all that much.  
**Mai:** We're plenty glad just to have you stopping their movments. Right?  
**Sanae:** Exactly. It buys us time to get people to safety, and it makes it harder for the aradama to fight back. You're a huge help.  
**Mikoto:** I'm just glad to be able to help somehow. This much is nothing to pay back what you've done for us, so whenever you're suppressing them, go ahead and give me a call.  
**Mai:** Thank you. Now then, it looks like the noro is finished being recovered too, so why don't we head back to Renpu for now?  
**Ruiko:** Ah, welcome back, Misaka-san, Shirai-san. You too, Yanase-san, Iwakura-san; good work out there.  
**Ruiko:** How'd it go? The usual metal collection.  
**Mai:** If I had to say one way or the other, it's going well. But, it isn't as if we're gathering lots of metal at once, so it could take a while.  
**Mikoto:** I guess we have no choice but to go slow and steady. There's no use rushing it.  
**Mikoto:** Though, the aradama... I'm a little surprised at how often they're appearing.  
**Kuroko:** They show themselves so many times per day. Working as a toji must be challenging.  
**Chie:** I'm sorry to have you two come with us to the fighting even though you aren't toji yourselves.  
**Mikoto:** We're the ones who said we wanted to come along.  
**Chie:** Even so, you shouldn't push yourselves, alright? If anything happens, don't hesitate to tell your onee-san here.  
**Ruiko:** That's some impressive broad-mindedness you've got there... But, you won't beat out Konori-senpai!  
**Mii:** Just what... kind of competition is that?  
**Mai:** By the way, what have you been up to there, Uiharu-san?  
**Kazari:** I asked the toji at Renpu to provide me with their data, and did a little looking into the distribution of appearances of aradama containing the newly created tamahagane metal.  
**Kazari:** Please take a look. It seems like many of the aradama appearing in Kanto match those cases.  
**Mirja:** I see; this is a discovery, isn't it.  
**Mirja:** Hardly any were found outside the range of Kanto. We should be able to collect these metals to a more efficient degree using this.  
**Kazari:** Sure; I thought I might be able to help out some, so I'm glad to hear it.  
**Misaki:** And I see even more appearing now. There really are too many aradama in this world of yours.  
**Maki:** Which toji can be dispatched there fastest...  
**Yume:** I'll go-. If I leave it to Kuroko-onee-san, she can get me there in an instant, right? I wanna try teleporting!  
**Kuroko:** I'd just like to make one thing clear, I am not an amusement park attraction, understand?  
**Mikoto:** Don't be like that and let's get going, Kuroko! You too, Tsubakuro-san!  
**Kuroko:** I suppose there's no helping it. Then, let me see the location information of where they appeared.  
**Kuroko:** Now then, let's go. Are you two prepared?  
**Mikoto/Yume:** Anytime!  
**Kofuki:** Hey, take me with you! ...Or they're already gone, I guess. Don't go stealing my aradama-chan like that.  
**Chie:** No matter how many times I see it, it still surprises me. These esper abilities.  

## 4: What's the Reason for Why They Gather?
And so, by cooperating with the toji, Mikoto and the others steadily gathered the metals the experiment seemed to have created.

  
**Ruiko:** Everyone's out on missions again today, huh.  
**Ruiko:** With the aradama showing up every day, it figures they'd need special schools for raising toji.  
**Kazari:** Academy City deals with some incidents of its own, but in this world, these are more like hard to prevent natural disasters.  
**Ruiko:** Misaka-san and the others must be working hard too-. Hey, the chocolate mint ice cream they have here might also be pretty good!  
**Misaki:** Maybe soo. ...Mm, this is delicious too~.  
**Kazari:** Still, doesn't it feel a little bad sitting in here eating sweets while all the toji are out working?  
**Misaki:** Uiharu-san, you're worrying too much~.  
**Misaki:** At times like these, the best thing to do is leave it all to those used to big flashy fights, like Misaka-san.  
**Misaki:** Besides, if we went to do something we aren't used to, we'd be nothing more than a burden, wouldn't we?  
**Ruiko:** And also, you're already helping out here and there yourself, Uiharu.  
**Kazari:** I'm not doing anything!  
**Misaki:** Neither am I, you knoww?  
**Kazari:** Ah, Konori-senpai came in with Yanase-san and Iwakura-san.  
**Sanae:** There you are. We were thinking of taking a short break. Do you mind if we sit with you?  
**Misaki:** Go right ahead-.  
**Mii:** What were you three talking about?  
**Kazari:** About how, all the toji are still students, but they're so responsible. It has to be tough, going out on missions every day.  
**Mai:** It may be difficult, but this is just daily life here in our Japan.  
**Sanae:** On top of that, exorcising aradama is an important duty for toji.  
**Mai:** When you all came here and saw aradama for the first time, you tried to protect the people, didn't you?  
**Mai:** I think that's far more incredible. Thanks to you, I'm sure there were people who could get to safety unhurt.  
**Sanae:** Yeah. It would be normal for you to run away scared.  
**Kanami:** So you were in here, Mai-chan.  
**Mai:** Good work suppressing the aradama, you two.  
**Mirja:** What are you drinking, by the way, Konori Mii?  
**Mii:** Just milk. It doesn't seem like you have my favorite brand over here, so I took what I found.  
**Mirja:** I see. I happen to like milk myself, but I never paid much attention to the brands I drink. You have distinctive tastes.  
**Mii:** They aren't quite so distinctive as you think.  
**Mii:** Anyway, did you find more of that metal during your work today?  
**Mirja:** Yes. However, it's still proving difficult. We seem to need a specific amount to meet our goal, and what we've found is insufficient.  
**Kanami:** We got less than I thought... I know you must all want to get home as soon as you can too.  
**Misaki:** That's nothing for you to feel bad about, Etou-sann. The only reason we can get them in the first place is thanks to you toji.  
**Kazari:** That's right.  
**Mirja:** This is...  
**Mirja:** Everyone, this is a request for aid from Setouchi Chie, Shichinosato Kofuki, and Mashiko Kaoru's group, who were accompanying Misaka Mikoto and Shirai Kuroko today.  
**Mirja:** It seems aradama are gathering there one after another, and the situation is urgent.  
**Kanami:** Let's get over there on the double then!  
**Mikoto:** There seriously is... just no end to them, is there. What's going on?  
**Kofuki:** Business is booming today, huh?  
**Mikoto:** I'm going to shock them into slowing down, so hang o--  
**Kofuki:** Keep it to yourself!  
**Mikoto:** Huh!? What do you mean!?  
**Kofuki:** There's no challenge in playing with aradama-chan after they've been tripped up! You go help Chichie or something.  
**Kofuki:** Come and show me a good time; gimme some fresh aradama-chan!  
**Kuroko:** Honestly, what is her problem? Refusing Onee-sama's assistance like that.  
**Chie:** Sorry about her. She just really loves fighting aradama is all...  
**Kaoru:** I'd be glad for anything you can do to make things easier. Just keep making 'em sit still over here, Mikoto.  
**Kaoru:** And then Chie'll take care of them all.  
**Chie:** You'll be helping too, Kaoru-san.  
**Mikoto:** Then, this'll sting--  
**Aradama:** ......!  
**Kaoru:** These ones are still squirming around.  
**Mikoto:** ...I'll pay them a visit then!  
**Kaoru:** Alright, until Kanami and them get here, I guess I'll work a little.  
**Kaoru:** --KIEEEEEE!  
**Chie:** If you could please keep it coming, just like that. --SEII!  
**Kuroko:** Despite all her talk of skipping out, she does her job well, doesn't she.  
**Mikoto:** ...And now, more showed up? If I just have to keep doing this, then...  
**Chie:** It isn't normally like this though... I wonder why.  
**Kaoru:** Kuroko-. If you think things're looking rough, take Mikoto and get out of here right away-.  
**Kuroko:** I would do that regardless. Onee-sama's safety is my top priority.  
**Mikoto:** HAAAAAAAH!  
**Kanami:** Oh, good timing! Mai-chan, let's finish them off!  
**Mai:** Sure. I'll be with you! --SEEEI!  
**Kuroko:** Those two harmonize almost as well as Onee-sama and myself. As if they can read each other's minds.  
**Mikoto:** You're not wrong. At least, about the part where they're in sync.  
**Mirja:** They truly are gathering here... Shichinosato Kofuki must be overjoyed at the situation, but where is she?  
**Kofuki:** Agh, why'd you guys come out here. Don't go taking my aradama-chan from me.  
**Maki:** You don't get a say in this. We'll all wipe them out at once. That's the most reliable way.  
**Maki:** Sorry, but it'd help if you lent us your power, Misaka.  
**Mikoto:** Sure, you got it.  
**Yume:** Well, it's not like it's that different for me whether the aradama get stopped or they're still moving-.  
**Kanami:** With Yume-chan here, we've got the strength of a hundred people. Though, I'm not about to get outdone!  
**Sanae:** As you'd guess, after all the aradama we defeated today, we managed to collect a lot of tamahagane.  
**Sanae:** Though, why were those aradama appearing around Setouchi-san and the others, anyway?  
**Maki:** Did anything different from usual happen?  
**Kaoru:** Nah, nothing I can think of. Right?  
**Mikoto:** I can't think of anything either. I just gave my support like I always do.  
**Ellen:** Big news, I have big news!  
**Mai:** Ellen-chan? What's going on?  
**Ellen:** Here's the story: we've found out something about this newly created tamahagane metal!  
**Ellen:** It seems like, if you apply a fixed electromagnetic wave to it, it becomes easy to bond the metals together!  
**Ellen:** Though, we don't know if this is the result of it being created from an applied electric current, or if it had these properties from the beginning.  
**Mikoto:** An electromagnetic wave?  
**Kaoru:** Oi... Don't tell me.  
**Kaoru:** If there's aradama with that metal in them nearby, that won't make them come running, will it?  
**Ellen:** Since we haven't investigated these aradama themselves, I can't say either way. But, I think there's a possibility. Since it was incorporated into the aradama, it must have kind of effect.  
**Mikoto:** Then, the reason they kept gathering together today was because...  
**Yume:** Cause Biribiri-onee-san was calling them all there?  
**Mikoto:** C-Come to think of it... I was firing off electricity harder than usual, because there weren't many people nearby.  
**Mikoto:** ...Is that what caused it!?  
**Ellen:** Hmm hmm, I do think this is a very interesting case.  
**Mii:** So long as we gathered lots as well, it all turned out alright, Misaka-san.  
**Mikoto:** That's true, but... When I think of my own power causing trouble...  
**Maki:** This is just a layman's opinion, but, if Misaka's elecric shocks are gathering the aradama, could we not use that to bring them all to one place?  
**Ruiko:** That's it! I think that's a great idea!  
**Kaoru:** That might make dealing with this easier. If all goes well, we can could finish this up in one shot.  
**Kanami:** If we take out all the aradama gathered there at once, it'll mean Misaka-san and the others can go home sooner.  
**Mikoto:** None of us object to that. Right?  
**Kazari:** I think it's a good plan.  
**Misaki:** It seems like Misaka-san is the cause of lots of problems, so you'll have to work hard enough to make up for it.  
**Mikoto:** You don't have to chime in on every little thing... You're not doing anything either.  
**Maki:** It'd be best to get this taken care of as soon as we can. Tomorrow, we'll start preparing to carry out the operation.  
**Maki:** Kitora, Yanase, Iwakura, and Setouchi, I want you working together on the strategy.  
**Maki:** The rest of you are dismissed. Rest up for tomorrow!  

## 5: Steel, a Flash of Light, and a Twist of Fate
The following day--

  
**Kanami:** Misaka-san, are you nervous?  
**Mikoto:** No, not particularly. Ah, not to make it sound like I haven't been thinking this through...  
**Kanami:** I get it. I know how much you've been helping us suppress aradama this whole time.  
**Kanami:** We'll pull this off for sure; today's operation.  
**Mikoto:** Of course!  
**Mikoto:** Do you know where we're doing it? I think it'd be good to be someplace like yesterday, out in the mountains where there aren't many people around.  
**Mai:** We do too. The plan is to have Misaka-san fire off her electricity and call the aradama to a place with little people nearby.  
**Mii:** That would be the best strategy for avoiding casualties.  
**Ruiko:** Wah!? Th-That surprised me...  
**Chie:** Oh no... It looks like there's multiple appearances of aradama! These readings, they're increasing little by little?  
**Maki:** The site isn't far. All toji here will leave straight away. Misaka, it'd help if you came with us, just to be safe.  
**Mikoto:** That's what I planned on from the start. Let's hurry! --Come on, Kuroko!  
**Kuroko:** Of course, Onee-sama!  
**Kazari:** ...Wait? Isn't this place where the aradama are appearing... It's right near where we first came to this world, isn't it?  
**Ruiko:** Eh, weren't there a lot of people walking around there? ...Is this going to be okay?  
**Misaki:** Hmmm.  
**Misaki:** You knoww, since this might be the last time and alll, what do you think about going to take a look?  
**Aradama:** GUOOOOOOOO!!  
**Kofuki:** What's going on here? Today's aradama-chan are biting at the bit! There's loads of 'em too!  
**Mirja:** This isn't good... Evacuations haven't been fully completed yet. As things are now, the civilians will come under attack... Shichinosato Kofuki, Setouchi Chie, hold off that large aradama!  
**Kofuki:** Leave it all to me!  
**Chie:** You're going to take care of the evacuations, right, Mirja-san? We'll handle things here.  
**Mirja:** It would be too optimistic to think aradama wouldn't approach civilians in the process of evacuating, after all.  
**Mikoto:** Can I suggest something? What if Kuroko and I go around hitting the aradama one by one with my electricity, and Shidou-san and everyone follows along taking them out?  
**Kuroko:** It can give you some time to help lead the evacuations. Onee-sama and I should be able to do that much.  
**Maki:** I hate to put you two in such a dangerous role, but could I ask you to do that?  
**Mikoto:** I know, just leave it to me. Help me out here, Kuroko!  
**Kuroko:** I can't say I don't object to you diving into danger, but you've always been one to take action at times like these, Onee-sama.  
**Kuroko:** Then, if you'd give me your hand.  
**Maki:** We'll take care of what we need to also.  
**Sanae:** I know, there's one thing we have to make sure of. We can't let any of the civilians to get hurt...  
**Mai:** Let's eliminate the aradama. Quickly!  
**Mikoto:** Take some of this--!  
**Aradama:** Gu... Ggu...!  
**Kuroko:** Well done. Then, on to the next.  
**Kuroko:** My positioning could steal one's heart, if I say so myself. Now, Onee-sama--  
**Aradama:** Gg... Ggg...!  
**Mikoto:** Kuroko, next!  
**Ruiko:** Misaka-san and Shirai-san are incredible out there, but Etou-san, Tsubakuro-san, and Shidou-san are pretty amazing too... ...They're taking out aradama left and right!  
**Kazari:** Still, there's some people who haven't evacuated yet... Is there anything we can do to lend a hand?  
**Mii:** I think we should try not to get in their way, but I understand how you feel. Should we go ask to see if we can help a little?  
**Kazari:** Alright...!  
**Ruiko:** There they go. I should go with. What about you, Shokuhou-san?  
**Ruiko:** ...Wait, what're you taking out your remote for?  
**Misaki:** Just a little somethingg.  
**Misaki:** I myself plan on getting to safetyy, but, more importantly, won't those two leave you behind if you don't hurry?  
**Ruiko:** Ah! Wait up-. Uiharu-, Konori-senpai-.  
**Misaki:** And, beep. With that--  
**Misaki:** (By altering the memories of the people here juuust a little, so that they leave immediately, it should speed up the evacuations, shouldn't it?)  
**Misaki:** Now it's up to Misaka-san to go at it like a workhorse.  
**Kanami:** It looks like they've finished up evacuating, but with more and more aradama coming, can you really keep up with this!?  
**Mikoto:** I'll be fine. Though... We need to do something about them.  
**Mai:** Looking at the the spectrum finder, the aradama detected in the area... all seem to be gathering around Misaka-san.  
**Kaoru:** At this rate, it'll turn out just like that operation we were setting up today.  
**Mikoto:** ...Still, we'll just have to go along with it. I don't think we can try taking the them somewhere else at this point. If they're coming to me, we'll use that and finish them all off at once.  
**Kaoru:** You're saying you can take care of this many of them!? Seriously...? That's crazy.  
**Mikoto:** I have a secret weapon. I'll make sure to aim it off in the sky, so it should be safe.  
**Mikoto:** But this could be a little dangerous for all you toji, so stand back.  
**Mikoto:** I'm going to put an end to all the mess you're causing. ...This is me at... FULL POWERRRR!!  
**Mai:** A-Amazing...  
**Yume:** But hey, doesn't it look like they're all turning into one big aradama!?  
**Aradama Roar:** GUOOOOOOOOONN!!  
**Mikoto:** Ah...  
**Kaoru:** Ellen said the metal'd bond together, but I didn't think that meant the aradama would too...  
**Mikoto:** Is this going to be okay...?  
**Maki:** It shouldn't be a problem for us. You did a great job. Thanks.  
**Yume:** Yeah, yeah. To pay you back for that, I'll let you see what makes me so great now~.  
**Yume:** You just sit back and watch, Biribiri-onee-san!  
**Kofuki:** I don't get to see aradama-chan like this all that much. Damn... I'm getting goosebumps!  
**Mirja:** Heh, it's only at moments like this I can depend on your enthusiasm, Shichinosato Kofuki.  
**Chie:** Kofuki-chan gets so lively at times like these, doesn't she?  
**Sanae:** If we just handle this like we usually do, it should be fine.  
**Mai:** Mmhm. We just need to pool our strength--  
**Kanami:** We can do this, everyone! Let's go!  

After supressing the aradama--

  
**Mai:** We managed to gather lots of that metal, but, will Misaka-san and the others really be able to get home with this?  
**Mikoto:** To be honest, I'm not sure. Though, it's not like we'll get anywhere if we don't give it a shot.  
**Ellen:** Grandpa said we should aim to get as much of the newly created tamahagane metal that would be needed to make one okatana. We have just enough!  
**Kofuki:** Besides, if we just kept on picking up metal, who knows when it'd end.  
**Misaki:** We don't know just how much of this metal came over here with us in the first placee.  
**Ruiko:** Now that you mention it, this could be the end of our parallel world lifestyle here, huhh.  
**Kazari:** At least be happy that we could get to go back home-.  
**Kazari:** Though, I would have liked to have eaten more of the B-grade gourmet Iwakura-san showed me about.  
**Ruiko:** So you feel the same, Uiharu-!  
**Ruiko:** I wanted to look more into rumors and things unique to this world too. Who gets chances at stuff like this.  
**Yume:** Ahaha, you onee-sans are funny!  
**Sanae:** It's a shame we can't say we'll do that next time, but I'm glad to hear it got your interest.  
**Mirja:** What do we need to do in order to replicate the experiment that will send you home?  
**Mii:** When we arrived, Misaka-san sent out a strong electric current, so doesn't it seem possible doing the same thing might have the same effect?  
**Kaoru:** If it doesn't work, we can figure something out then.  
**Kanami:** And if it does, it might really mean goodbye. Ah, I shouldn't say "might", should I.  
**Mikoto:** Yeah. We caused you a lot of trouble, but tha--  
**Kuroko:** Ahh... Once Onee-sama and I return to our love nest, we can start with a gentle hug and passionate kiss.  
**Kuroko:** And then, Onee-sama and I will, ahhhn--!!  
**Mikoto:** K-Kuroko! Don't go causing a misunderstanding... saying things like that at a time like this!  
**Kuroko:** Calling it a misunderstanding is too too much... And after, ever since we came to this world, I've been refraining from our everyday skinship; you're heartless, Onee-sama!   
**Kuroko:** I can't... I can't stand it any longer, Onee-samaaahhn!  
**Mii:** In its own way, things are already back to normal.  
**Mikoto:** I told you, get off of me!  
**Ruiko:** Doesn't this kind of feel like how it was like when we first came here?  
**Misaki:** That's truee. This feels like it really could be goodbye.  
**Kazari:** All of you toji should get away, quick! Just to be safe!  
**Mii:** Thank you so much, for all the accomodations you gave us.  
**Mikoto:** Aghh, come on! I wish I could've given a proper goodbye at least... Thanks for everything. We won't forget about you--  
**Kanami:** Stay safe-! Or, they're already gone, huh.  
**Maki:** I wonder if they managed to make it home okay.  
**Yume:** There's not much point in asking that, is there? We can't make sure either way.  
**Chie:** Tsubakuro-san isn't wrong. But we can at least pray for their safe return.  
**Kaoru:** Still, esper powers, huh-. There might be all kinds of worlds out there that we just don't know about.  
**Kanami:** Yeah! They really were unbelievable people.  

## 6: What Do We Need to Do to Get Home?
**Kanami:** Shidou-san. I brought Mikasa-san and everyone-.  
**Maki:** Thanks. I'll get straight to the point then.  
**Maki:** I'm sure you can all imagine why I've BROUGHT you here. The investigation into this metal found among the noro has made progress.  
**Ruiko:** Then, you found something out?  
**Maki:** Kohagura, can I leave the explanation to you?  
**Ellen:** Understood! Nice to meet you, I'm Kohagura Ellen. Let's all get along, okay!  
**Ruiko:** Wow-, check it out, Uiharu. She's huge.  
**Kazari:** You know you shouldn't do that... Even if you're thinking it, don't say it.  
**Mai:** Ellen-chan is the granddaughter of Dr. Friedman, the man investigating this metal, and she got us in touch with their research institute.  
**Ellen:** First, I'll share what we've learned.  
**Ellen:** According to Grandpa and the Special Rare Metals Utilization Research Institute, although this metal is being found in the noro, it did not exist in our world beforehand.  
**Ellen:** Although it's similar in composition to Tamahagane, it is a different metal. Even with the same volume, it's slightly lighter, for example.  
**Mikoto:** If it's a different metal, then that means it did come with us from our world...?  
**Ellen:** I think there's a good chance of that.  
**Ellen:** Of course, it's also possible that it was created at the point you all arrived here, for some still unknown reason.  
**Mii:** It seems clear that the tamahagane created from the experiment Misaka-san helped with is something brand new.  
**Kuroko:** Though, that much won't help us find a means of going back to our own world.  
**Kaoru:** Oi, Ellen. How about you tell them the theory you were talking about before?  
**Ellen:** I guess I should. This isn't confirmed yet, but we have a hypothesis about our world, your world, and what caused them to be linked together.  
**Ellen:** According to Grandpa, this metal, which closely resembles tamahagane, may have been a catalyst for going through the netherworld to here.  
**Mikoto:** So, if we came here through the netherworld, how would we go about getting back home?  
**Ellen:** If we assume that the tamahagane you tried to create also exists in your original world, if we try to form the same tamahagane here, then--  
**Kazari:** You mean, the same thing that happened when we came here might happen again?  
**Ellen:** We're only talking hypothetically, but that's exactly right! And, for that reason, we'll need to gather as much of that generated metal as we possibly can.  
**Kanami:** So then, when we're on missions, there might be aradama with that metal inside them, so we need to watch out.  
**Mai:** Yep! From the aradama we've defeated in the past few days, there seems to be lots of cases of finding noro containing that metal, though only in small amounts.  
**Kanami:** We'll get up a whole bunch of it so you can go home, so just wait a little while longer.  
**Mikoto:** Thank you.  
**Mikoto:** But, let us do what we can too. We might not be able to defeat aradama, but I think we can help. It seems like we're the cause of this, after all.  
**Kanami:** With your electric shocks, and depending on how we use Shirai-san's teleportation, it might be effective in fighting aradama?  
**Kuroko:** If that's what Onee-sama plans on doing, I, Kuroko, will offer you toji my assistance.  
**Mikoto:** Shidou-san. Will you allow us to help you eliminate the aradama?  
**Maki:** I'd honestly like to refuse you here, but, alright. Only on the condition that you never put yourselves at risk. Fighting the aradama is our duty.  
**Mikoto:** Understood, thank you very much! Alright-, let's go!  
**Kanami:** Let's give it our all, Misaka-san!  
**Misaki:** Do your best, everyone~.
