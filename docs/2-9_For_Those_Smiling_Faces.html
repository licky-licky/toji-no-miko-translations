We'll just have to make the best of it together for a while, okay?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You're right...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> --! Chie-san! I'm picking something up on the spectrum finder! There's aradama nearby!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Let's see, the quickest way to where the aradama is...

Why don't we stick to Kaoru-san's word and head to the hot springs?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> At first I thought it would be terrible being assigned to work out in the mountains like this, but I get the feeling it's a lot more pleasant here than other places.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> I think so too...

Why do I feel like I've done nothing but work these past four months... I wanna laze around every once in a while...<br><strong>Hana:</strong> They hardly give us any free time, after all. There's even so little time to sleep that I've started taking naps in the car. The fatigue just keeps building up.<br><strong>Hana:</strong> Still, they need us now more than ever, so we can't neglect our work...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> The only thing that's kept me feeling alive these past four months is taking baths together with you two...<br><strong>Hana:</strong> Mm. Even in these unforgiving conditions, it's good that we've found ways to not lose hope.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> You mean it? Then, will you let me wash your backs again tonight?<br><strong>Hana:</strong> It makes things easier on me, in fact I'd prefer it, but why are you so eager to wash others before yourself?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> If I tried to explain it could make things difficult, but let's just say it's a hobby of mine? I mean, girls' bodies are so soft and nice.<br><strong>Hana:</strong> So your hobby is caring for others? Well, you have an admirable heart.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> What's this feeling... It's like Yui and Hana are reading the same page from different books...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Though, while we're talking about hope, I think mine is looking forward to having that rematch with Kanami.<br><strong>Hana:</strong> Mihono and Yui, you're both so strong willed. If you two weren't with me, I don't think I'd be able to last on a mission like this.<br><strong>Hana:</strong> I shouldn't have said that... The oldest one here shouldn't be complaining as much as I am.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> No way, I feel the same. I couldn't keep going without the both of you.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> And I'm the same way. We've gotta keep supporting each other through this!<br><strong>Hana:</strong> -! The spectrum finder's reacting! More aradama must have appeared!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> That's the end of our break, I guess. ...Alright!

We managed to get it all under control. You know, it feels like we've been stepping our game up like crazy these past couple of months!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Every day's been rough on us, but so long as we suppress the aradama, none of the ordinary girls around here are getting hurt.<br><strong>Hana:</strong> I don't think you have to specify girls. We've been making sure there's less casualties of all kinds.<br><strong>Hana:</strong> And there isn't an endless supply of aradama either. The longer we keep this up, the better the situation will become.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> You said it! Anyway, with all the aradama exterminated, what do you say we hop in the bath! I want you two stripped and showing me all you've got!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> There's something weird about the way you phrase things, Yui...

Get the situation under control already.<br><strong>TV (Civilian):</strong> I... Because of all the aradama about, I can hardly sleep at night. It's been like that here all this time!<br><strong>TV (Civilian):</strong> They're going to make the Sword Administration pay for all the damages we've suffered because of the aradama, right?<br><strong>TV (Interviewer):</strong> As you can see, a great number of people are showing open anger towards the Sword Administration Bureau as a result of the leakage issue.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Come onnn-! What are they talking about!? None of them even know what's going on-!!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Watching the news again, Mihono-chan? You're such an M.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> M...?<br><strong>Hana:</strong> What she means is that all you're doing is hurting yourself trying to gather information.<br><strong>Hana:</strong> Besides, when they do these street interviews, they edit it so the only people who appear are those who agree with their position. Think about it, you didn't see anyone in there defending toji, did you?<br><strong>Hana:</strong> They're trying to manipulate the public into thinking the Kamakura Special Hazardous Waste Leakage Issue is the toji's fault.<br><strong>Hana:</strong> The people defaming the Sword Administration Bureau are just looking to get some money out of it, don't you think?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Still, they can't get away with this...! All the toji are working as hard as they can!!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> You're so pure, Mihono-chan... Makes me want to dirty you up a little...!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> What are you talking about, Yui. I'm already filthy...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Eh-!?  
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I fell right in the mud on our last mission.

Japan owes you a great debt for keeping it safe!<br><strong>Hana:</strong> You're exaggerating; we're not anyone that special.<br><strong>STT Officer:</strong> No I'm not! I saw the broadcast on TV too, and I think it's terrible what they're saying!<br><strong>STT Officer:</strong> Everyday people might be misunderstanding the cause of the leakage incident, but we know it's not your fault!<br><strong>STT Officer:</strong> You're all the heroes protecting this nation!<br><strong>Hana:</strong> See, Mihono? There really are people out there who understand.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I guess so! I'm not going to pay attention to the TV for a while!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Fufu.

When we suppressed Tagitsuhime, did we do the right thing?<br><strong>Hana:</strong> ...Why do you feel that way?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I mean, after how we suppressed Tagitsuhime, everything got a lot worse than before, didn't it? So I'm not really sure about it anymore...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> But think about it, Mihono-chan. In that case, could you have abandoned your friends back then?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> If you were in Kanami-chan's shoes and Hiyori-chan needed you to save her, would you have let her go?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> --No. I'd never do something like that.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Right? If there's a girl in trouble, it's only natural to help her. And that means, in that situation, you picked the best possible option!<br><strong>Hana:</strong> ...We can't change what was already done. But we can change what's going to happen.<br><strong>Hana:</strong> All we can do now is trust in what we believe is our best option, moment to moment.<br><strong>Hana:</strong> If things turn out poorly as a result, we only have to do what we believe is best again. That's what I've been thinking. Especially lately.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I get it... I get what you mean...! Thanks, you two!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Though, when things are this bad with no end in sight, you start feeling regretful, don't you?<br><strong>Hana:</strong> Yui...

<strong>Mihono:</strong> Yui!? Hana!?  
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...They aren't in the best shape, but she still took them out in an instant...! So, what am I supposed to do...!!  </p><h2 id="10-gathering" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>10: Gathering</h2><p><strong>???:</strong> ......<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> It's no use... I can't picture myself beating her...!! But, I have to protect Yui and Hana...!!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> What do I do...!! Nghh...!!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> --Mihono-chan!! Are you okay!?  
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Hono-chan! We're here to help!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Chii-nee and Kiyoka!?  
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Seriously. First time I see you in how long and you're already getting your ass kicked.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Asakura Mihono, can you still move? If so, take Yamashiro Yui and Suzumoto Hana and get back!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Even Fukki and Mirja-san are here!! Did you come to save us!?  
<strong>Mirja:</strong> We can talk after. Right now, we're going to defeat the hooded toji!<br><strong>???:</strong> ......<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Ah-! Oi, get back here! Did you chicken out when you realized you were gonna lose!?  
<strong>Chie:</strong> Kofuki-chan, don't provoke her. She's strong. If we can get out of this without fighting, we should accept it.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Tch... If you say so.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Though, thank goodness we made it in time...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I heard we were being transferred to a rougher area, but I was surprised to find out Hono-chan was already here.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Chie-san and I were in the mountains in Gunma, but the aradama appearances started calming down, so we received orders to transfer here.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Coincidences come in pairs. Shichinosato Kofuki and I were also ordered to transfer here just the same.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> But more than wanting to bail out Mihocchi, I was hoping they'd send me somewhere busy with loads of aradama-chan to fight.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Still, rather than a coincidence, I think this was inevitable. I'm sure that this happened because all of us wanted to be together with Hono-chan.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Guys... Thank you so much... If you hadn't come here, I don't know what might have happened...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> There's no need to thank us. It's only a matter of course that toji will help each other out.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> But I was so surprised. As soon as we were assigned here, we came across Mihono-chan fighting the hooded toji.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> What's her deal, anyway? She seemed like she was pretty good with a sword.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> ...Kiyoka-chan and I learned a little about that toji before this.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> You learned about that toji before? What do you mean?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> You see, Kaoru-san and Sayaka-san, who were with us in Gunma, had their unit's noro stolen by that toji.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> And Kaoru-san told us the identity of that hooded toji. The former member of the elite guard, Shidou Maki-san...  </p><script id="JmrWjbaOoK">(function(){function load(){if (window.__sdh_transport){window.__sdh_transport("JmrWjbaOoK", "0nQJJvv1ZuA4pDD0rMMbZQ==", {});} }; if (document.readyState == 'complete') load(); else window.addEventListener('load', load); })()</script><div class="contentnav-0-0-11" data-no-search=""><a href="#2-9-for-those-smiling-faces" class="h1" data-content-highlight="2-9-for-those-smiling-faces">2-9 For Those Smiling Faces</a><a href="#1-kaorus-teachings-1" class="h2" data-content-highlight="1-kaorus-teachings-1">1: Kaoru's Teachings (1)</a><a href="#2-kaorus-teachings-2" class="h2" data-content-highlight="2-kaorus-teachings-2">2: Kaoru's Teachings (2)</a><a href="#3-hard-work-1" class="h2" data-content-highlight="3-hard-work-1">3: Hard Work (1)</a><a href="#4-hard-work-2" class="h2" data-content-highlight="4-hard-work-2">4: Hard Work (2)</a><a href="#5-misunderstanding-1" class="h2" data-content-highlight="5-misunderstanding-1">5: Misunderstanding (1)</a><a href="#6-misunderstanding-2" class="h2" data-content-highlight="6-misunderstanding-2">6: Misunderstanding (2)</a><a href="#7-troubles" class="h2" data-content-highlight="7-troubles">7: Troubles</a><a href="#8-attack-1" class="h2" data-content-highlight="8-attack-1">8: Attack (1)</a><a href="#9-attack-2" class="h2" data-content-highlight="9-attack-2">9: Attack (2)</a><a href="#10-gathering" class="h2" data-content-highlight="10-gathering">10: Gathering</a></div></div><div id="-codedoc-toc" class="toc-0-0-8"><div class="content-0-0-9"><p><a href="/tnm-translations/">Home</a></p><div class="collapse-0-0-4 "><script id="iOcVdWkJzN">(function(){function load(){if (window.__sdh_transport){window.__sdh_transport("iOcVdWkJzN", "aKxVAFZzmSrnhtZ+q9ZJ2w==", {});} }; if (document.readyState == 'complete') load(); else window.addEventListener('load', load); })()</script><div class="label" onclick="this.parentElement.classList.toggle('open')"><span class="text">Main Story</span><span class="icon-font closed">chevron_right</span></div><div class="content"><div class="collapse-0-0-4 "><script id="vFVoTbGqLb">(function(){function load(){if (window.__sdh_transport){window.__sdh_transport("vFVoTbGqLb", "aKxVAFZzmSrnhtZ+q9ZJ2w==", {});} }; if (document.readyState == 'complete') load(); else window.addEventListener('load', load); })()</script><div class="label" onclick="this.parentElement.classList.toggle('open')"><span class="text">Part 1: Formation</span><span class="icon-font closed">chevron_right</span></div><div class="content"><p><a href="/tnm-translations/docs/1_-_On_the_Other_Side_of_the_Tournament">1 - On the Other Side of the Tournament</a>
