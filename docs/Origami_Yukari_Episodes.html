Huh, that's weird... He was just here a minute ago... Hey, Ellen. You seen Nene anywhere?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Nene? Now that you mention it, I haven't.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Damnit, that little... Did he forget he's an aradama or something?<br><strong>Bodyguard Toji:</strong> Find it! It has to be around here somewhere! Tch, to think we let an aradama all the way in here...!<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Ne-...!<br><strong>Bodyguard Toji:</strong> Th-There it is! So that's where you were hiding!<br><strong>Nene:</strong> N-Nenene-!?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> ...They're awfully noisy out there...<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Ne...<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> You're the one from the Mashiko family...<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Nene, nene-!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> But what are you doing here? Don't you understand what this place is?<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Ne-? Nene, nenene-.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Where is the Mashiko toji? Shouldn't you always be at her side?<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Ne-, nene-! Nenene-! Ne-, nene-!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> ...There's no point in attempting conversation, is there...<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Fine then. Do as you like. So long as you don't disturb my work, you can stay.<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Ne~...<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Hmm... Where's the list of tournament participants. From Renpu... The toji Yukina told me about would be...<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Ne~ Nene~!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Hmm...<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Ne~ Nene-ne~!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> What? Do you want me to play with you...?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> That reminds me, the institution I inspected the other day offered me wagashi... Would you like some?<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Ne-! Nene-!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Very well. I'll go get them.<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Ne~! Nene~!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> An aradama happily eating wagashi... Really, what an odd thing you are.<br><strong>Voice:</strong> Oiii, Nene-! If you're there, say something-! Ughh, how far'd he run off to?<br><strong>Voice:</strong> Nene-! We explained everything to the guards, so they won't chase you anymore-!<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Ne...!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> I see, so that's what happened. You were the cause of the commotion earlier.<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Nene, ne-, nene-?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Hm? You're leaving already? Ahh, then you may go. But first... There is one thing I need to ask.<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Ne-?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> By all rights, humans and aradama are incapable of coexisting. Yet, in spite of that, you've taken up as the guardian beast of the Mashiko family.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Do you feel content living alongside humans?<br><strong>Nene:</strong> ...Ne~?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> ......<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Nene~...?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Ha...ã€€No, it wasn't a question I should have asked you, I suppose.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Leave. Do not ever return here. Do you understand?<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Ne-! Nenene-!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> At the end there, was it thanking me...? Ha... What an odd thing indeed.  </p><h2 id="2-her-conviction" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>2: Her Conviction</h2><p><strong>Maki:</strong> Yukari-sama, it's Shidou. I brought the documents you requested.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Enter.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Right, excuse me.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Here, please look over them.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> This is a compilation of all aradama outbreaks in recent years. And, in here is a list of all toji who enrolled in the Five Traditions this year.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Good work. I see... With this many entrants, it doesn't seem we'll have to worry about going shorthanded on toji in the near future.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> However, the issue at hand isn't one of manpower, but that we lack the ability to freely increase the number of toji... Isn't that right?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Yes. New okatana can be polished from Akabane swords, but the number of those we recover is never enough--<br><strong>Maki:</strong> --Nn?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Yu~kari-sama~! Let's pla... Oh, huh?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Dang~, Maki onee-san's here.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Yume... From the way it sounds, you were coming to bother Yukari-sama again, weren't you?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> But come on, what else am I supposed to do? Besides Yukari-sama, nobody's worth fighting against.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> ......<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Yume, I'm at work right now. Leave.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Tch, that's no fun.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Anyway, I'll be back later. Bye bye~!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> ......<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> You look discouraged, Maki. Is it because Yume doesn't acknowledge your skill with a sword?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> ...I believe I understand Yume's feelings towards swordfighting. I have no idea how she hides all her resolve in that small body.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> But, as a toji, I don't think my conviction and resolve are any weaker than hers. In spite of that, I'm still no match for Yume...<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> ...I see. Maki, you mentioned "conviction", but conviction is a desire to see something through.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> For example, no matter how many failures it takes, you would continue pursuing your goal. That's the sort of emotion it is.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> So, your conviction as a toji, what does it drive you to accomplish? To improve your skills with a sword, until there are none greater than you?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Ah...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> No, I only want to be strong enough to protect everyone and the people close to me from the threat of aradama...!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> If that's your goal, then don't be misguided in pursuing it. Just as Yume found her strength, you have your own. That's why I entrusted you with the first seat of the elite guard.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Right! I'll take that to heart!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Then, return to your duties. I'll examine these documents in more detail later.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Understood! I'll be going then!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> ......<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> (...Conviction...? How many years have I passed hanging onto that, I wonder...)<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> (But, even that... Will be over soon--)  </p><h2 id="3-partners-in-killing-time" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>3: Partners in Killing Time</h2><p><strong>Yukari:</strong> ......Hm. It gets quiet alone in the office by myself.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Though having said that, I can't exactly take a stroll outside without purpose. Acting as the head of the Origami family can be such an inconvenient position.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> ...Nn?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Hellooo~, Yu~kari-sama~!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Yume...? Enter.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ah-, none of the others are in here today? Nice, lucky me-!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> ......<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Hey, don't worry. I didn't come to play today. I actually have something really important I wanted to tell you, Yukari-sama.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Oh...?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Juuust kidding-!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Aww~, I lost again.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Oh? What happened, Yume?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I was sure I'd be able to beat Yukari-sama today. But I screwed up.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...Hold it right there, Yume. You don't mean, you--<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I'm deeply sorry, Yukari-sama! The moment I took my eyes off Yume, she came attacking you again...!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> It's fine. Pay it no mind.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> But...<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> In that case, will you put the room back in order after Yume made a mess of it? That may take some of the guilt off your mind.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yes, I'll see to it at once!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Well done. That's enough, Suzuka.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Understood. Um... I know this may be rude, but there's something I would like to ask.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> What is it? Speak your mind.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Why is it that you always encourage Yume by playing along with her? Surely you wouldn't allow anyone else to be so disrespectful.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Do you disapprove?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> No, that's not what I...! Only... I was wondering, if there's some special reason why you give her such freedom...<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Hm... A reason why I allow Yume freedom...?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> There you go again, Yukari-sama! I thought I took you by surprise, but you blocked that so easy...!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> But, I'm not done yet!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Hm...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> You look like you don't even care, but...! I can't even land a single hit!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Are you done now, Yume?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Of course not! Let's see how you handle this-!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Hyaaahhh-!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> (Oh, she's altered her swordsmanship yet again... Intriguing.)<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> (In spite of the fate her body is confined to, Yume's swordsmanship remains completely unbounded...)<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Um... Yukari-sama?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> It's nothing... Suzuka, to me, that is a way of killing time.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> So please, leave her be. She may not seem like it, but Yume is still considerate of the proper time and place.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...I understand. If that's what you wish, Yukari-sama.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> With that, I'll take my leave.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> (Yume's swordsmanship... That's what I feel from it-- "Freedom".)<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> (That... May be the reason. Why I find it so amusing to receive Yume's sword...)  </p><h2 id="4-secret-pastime" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>4: Secret Pastime</h2><p><strong>Yomi:</strong> I'll be going then, Yukari-sama.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> This investigation into the Special Ritual Squad's equipment loss rate last year... How long do you think it will take?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> The data is already roughly accumulated, so it should only take about one hour to request it from the person in charge.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Understood. I'll leave you to it.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes. Then, goodbye.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> ...Is she gone? Then...<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Let's get to this at once. I should still have some in stock... ...Hm, there they are.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> I have to open a window before anything else. Some ventilation is essential, so... There.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Now-- Time to begin.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Add the seasoning, then pour in hot water for 3 minutes. After that, remove the water and mix in the sauce. I see, fairly standard... This cup yakisoba.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Last time 4 minutes passed without me noticing, and the noodles had hardly any stiffness. Though, I didn't dislike it...<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> This vinyl cover... I can leave it in the drawer for now and dispose of it later.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> (If it were ever found out that the favorite food of the head of the Origami family was instant cup yakisoba-- All the dignity with which I've established myself until now could crumble...)<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> (People will not follow strength alone.)<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> (Dignity, formality, charisma... All accomplish nothing more than creating an impression, however they are indispensable to leading an organization.)<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> (It goes without saying that this must be kept hidden from Maki and Suzuka, Yume of course, and even Yomi.)<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> However, it's a real oddity... Cup yakisoba. It seems like every night I feel the urge to eat some... In spite of its crudeness...<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> No, but then again, maybe I should consider it from the perspective of a simple provision. All it requires is hot water, and with only 3 minutes needed to prepare... I cannot disrespect this-- This example of human ingenuity.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Those 3 minutes should have passed by now. Hm... That's quite a good scent.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> (Slurp, slurrp...)<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I've returned, Yukari-sama. Here is the data you requested.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Good, sorry to trouble you.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> No...<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ...? Um, Yukari-sama.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> What is it?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Did you open a window? The room's temperature seems different from before I left.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> ......<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> I thought a little ventilation would help clear my mind. What of it?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I just wondered if the air conditioning might be malfunctioning. I didn't mean to question you...<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> You don't need to concern yourself with that. I'm not a flower in a greenhouse.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes ma'am, I'll keep that in mind.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> That's enough for today, Yomi. Return to the dormitory and rest.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Understood. Then, I'll take my leave.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> ..................Hm. The position of the head of the Origami household needs consideration as well.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> (......)<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> (What was that small stain on Yukari-sama's clothing...? It wasn't there an hour ago...)<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> (Soy sauce...? Or some other sauce...?)<br><strong>Maki:</strong> What's wrong, Yomi? Is something on your mind?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ......<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yomi?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ......No, it's nothing.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Yukari-sama ordered me to rest, so will one of you please take over for me?  </p><h2 id="5-remnant-of-the-past" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>5: Remnant of the Past</h2><p><strong>Maki:</strong> Are you sure about this, Yukari-sama?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Yes, I don't mind.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Please, wait. Even for practice, four against one is too much...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> But what's wrong with that-? Yukari-sama's the one saying we can do it. Right? Yomi onee-san.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> If that's what she orders, I'll go along with it.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Still...<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Suzuka... Surely you don't mean you're worried about me?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> If so-- Are you that incapable of judging your opponent's strength; is that what you are saying?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Suzuka... I think you're getting needlessly worried. Even against a group, Yukari-sama's skills should be far greater than our own.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> And in that case... We should test ourselves against them. To find out just how we stack up to Yukari-sama. Isn't this a good opportunity to know more about ourselves?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Fu... That's very like you, Maki-san.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Hey, hey, let's get going already-.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Shidou-san, do you have a plan?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> I don't. Only to show the results of our daily training.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> ...Then let's begin. All of you, come at me with everything you can manage.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> What's the matter? Are you finished?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Pant, pant... Even with the four of us, we can't keep up after all...!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> That's the might of Origami Yukari...!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> What are you giving up for already, let's keep going-!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Fu...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yomi, let's rush her together!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Understood.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Kh... Maki-san! You're next!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Haaaaaahh-!!!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> (All members, consecutively attacking from Yume's starting point... To be able to coordinate to this degree without any prior signal; strong movements like these do justice to the name of elite guard...)<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> (Fu, it reminds me, the Special Task Team was like that as well...)<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> (Those who once fought at my side. Souraku Yuzuki, Takatsu Yukina, Hashima Ema, Gojou Iroha, Maniwa Sana-- As well as Hiiragi Kagari and Fujiwara Minato...)<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> (Thinking back on it, despite all our differences in temperament and fighting style, it was impressive how well we were able to match each other's movements...)<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> (Has it really been twenty years...? Kagari and Minato are gone, and time has taken its toll on the others. Yet, I still...)<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Gh... Gah...!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Maki-san!?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Kh... I-I can still...!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> ...That's enough. Sheath your okatana. Training is over.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Pant, pant, pant... I-I'm, still, ready to fight, though...?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Tsubakuro-san. Catch your breath.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ughh... Grrrr...!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Relax, Yume. I'll provide you more opportunities.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Maki, Suzuka, and Yomi all showed good coordination as well. Though there's room for improvement in your teamwork.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> ...I understand. But next time, I'll show you how much closer I can reach to you...!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Good, do not forget that feeling.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Those who cannot recognize their inexperience, have no room to grow from it...<br><div><iframe width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sMZQqm5pL1U"></iframe></div>  </p><h2 id="renpu-high-start-marshmallows" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Renpu High: Start]: Marshmallows</h2><p><strong>Minato:</strong> Yukari, Kagari, morning-!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Morning, Minato.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Good morning.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> You gotta hear this! Last night, I had this awesome dream-! In my dream, we were all a part of the tournament...<br><strong>Minato:</strong> But the white gravel at the tournament grounds had all turned into marshmallows, so we couldn't do it, and then we just decided to eat them all!<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Sigh... I shouldn't be surprised, Minato-senpai. Even your dreams don't make any sense...<br><strong>Minato:</strong> I mean, it was such a crazy dream that I felt like I had to tell you as soon as possible! You know how it is, right? Hey, Yukari, what kinda dream did you have last night?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> My dream last night... I think I had one...<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Ah...!<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Yukari-sama? What is it?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> It's nothing. Look, school is starting. Let's go to our classrooms.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> What that was about. Yukari was acting a little weird, wasn't she?<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Was she? Anyway, if we don't hurry, we'll be late. Really now, this is all your fault for launching into some long and pointless story about your dreams, Minato-senpai...<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Sorry about that. But still, wouldn't it be funny if that dream ended up coming true~?<br>In a break between classes.</p><p><strong>Minato:</strong> Ah~, I'm starving. I can't believe it's still only 2nd period.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Minato. So you were over here.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Yeah, I was hungry, so I thought I'd buy some bread from the school store. Why're you here, Yukari?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> No reason, really. We have music class next, don't we? Let's go together.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> O-Okay...<br>After school that day.</p><p><strong>Minato:</strong> Ah~, I can't be bothered today, so maybe I'll skip practice and take an afternoon nap.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Minato, you came out here to skip practice again...<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Sorry about that, Yukari. I'll try extra hard in practice starting tomorrow, so give everyone my regards~!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Wait. If you won't be coming to practice, I'll do self-training at my household too, so let's leave together.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Eh-- You will!?<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> What's going on, Yukari-sama? You're skipping practice along with Minato-senpai?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> There's no real reason for it. I just thought it would be nice for us to walk home together for once. Come on, Kagari, Minato. Let's go.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> There's something strange about Yukari-sama today, isn't there?<br><strong>Minato:</strong> That's what I'm saying. It always feels like I'm the one sticking close to Yukari, but today it's like it's the other way around... I wonder what happened... Nn-, I wanna know!  </p><h2 id="renpu-high-end-dream-come-true" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Renpu High: End]: Dream Come True</h2><p><strong>Minato:</strong> Ahh~, the three of us skipping practice and going home together feels all fresh and exciting! Want to stop by somewhere?<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Yukari-sama and I will be practicing as soon as we return to the Origami household. Please don't treat us like your accomplices, Minato-senpai.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Come on, don't be such a stick in the mud~. We never go home early together! There's this super cool secret spot I found that I'll show you.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Secret spot? And where is that?<br><strong>Minato:</strong> You'll have to wait and see. C'mon, let's go!<br><strong>Minato:</strong> You two are so slow~. If you keep it up, the sun's gonna go down~!<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Pant, pant. You're taking us up quite the mountain trail.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Minato, can't we leave it at this and go home for today? I have a strange feeling about this.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Hey, Yukari, what's this feeling about anyway? You've been acting kinda weird since this morning. Come on and tell us.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> ...<br><strong>Minato:</strong> If you just explain things, I'll hear you out, okay?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> I might just be getting afraid over nothing, but, this morning, I had a strange dream.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Up in a mountain, there was this mysterious shrine I had never seen before. You went running up the steps to it, Minato... And then, the moment I took my eyes off you, you vanished.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> As in... She was spirited away?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> I can't say that for sure, but I woke up with this feeling of unease, and it's worrying me.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Alright, I get it now! It's true that, unlike my dream, this one sounds like it could actually happen.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Minato-senpai, given what Yukari-sama is saying, can we not stop here today and go back?<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Hmm, you have a point. If Yukari's that sure about it...<br><strong>Minato:</strong> I know! Won't everything be fine if I just don't go on ahead like I did in Yukari's dream?<br><strong>Minato:</strong> I'll stay right with you every step of the way, alright? Since we already came this far, you'll definitely be missing out if you don't see it now! Okay?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> If you insist, Minato... Fine then, let's go see.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> You've got to! Don't worry; so long as the three of us are together, no matter where we go, we'll make it through!<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Okaaay, here we are!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> This is...<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> I didn't think cherry blossoms could still be in bloom somewhere at this time of season...<br><strong>Minato:</strong> This place is hidden away on the north side of the mountain, so it doesn't get much sun, which means the cherry blossoms bloom later than usual.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> I'm surprised you managed to find a place like this.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> I saw it in a dream I had. There were all these cherry blossoms blooming on the north side of a mountain. So I got interested, and when I came to check it out, I found this!<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> You mean, your dream came true then?<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Yep. If Yukari's dream came true, that'd be scary, but I'm glad a fun dream like this one was real!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> That's for sure. I hope we can be spared Minato getting spirited away or the gravel turning to marshmallows, but I'm very glad to see a dream like this come true.<br><div><iframe width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z23ZqgN4an4"></iframe></div>  </p><h2 id="dress-20---yukari-start-recognition-party-put-in-motion" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Dress '20 - Yukari: Start]: Recognition Party Put in Motion</h2><p><strong>Yume:</strong> I wanna have a party!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> A party?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Where's this coming from all of a sudden, Yume?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> The onee-sans who were in the Miss Five Traditions contest are all getting together for a party!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> So we should do it too!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> If that's what you meant, then I've heard about it as well.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Though, it seemed to be more of a recognition party than a simple gathering.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> A recognition party?
