Guys, there's something there!<br><strong>???:</strong> So you've come.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Who are you?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> That body... Too warped to call a human, but I've never heard of an aradama speaking?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Hmmm~? Heh, not bad... My school too.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> What do you mean, Shichinosato Kofuki...!? No, hang on. Are those... Akabane swords!?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Yes. There's no mistaking that rusted okatana she's holding. Not only that, but the pile she's sitting on. They're all Akabane swords.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> There must be hundreds in there. Where did they all come from...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> No, in the first place, we came here to meet someone who could answer the mystery behind the Akabane swords. So, would that person be you?<br><strong>???:</strong> Aah, that I am. The one you toji have sought out, the one you have come here to find. Without a doubt, that is I.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> And... All the things beneath your feet, those are Akabane swords, aren't they?<br><strong>???:</strong> Right. The Akabane swords.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ...Then we're not making a mistake here, are we.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> H-Hang on a second! That means... You're the one using all these Akabane swords...?<br><strong>???:</strong> Right.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Then... You were here? From here? Scattering all these swords?<br><strong>???:</strong> Right.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I don't get it...!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I thought you said we were coming here to find someone who could help us stop the Akabane swords!?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> But instead we find the culprit holding them, the one causing all these problems!?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> So, what? Mirja-san! Chii-nee! What's going on!? Give me an explanation!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ......<br><strong>???:</strong> Why will you not speak. Then I will explain it for you. Simply, like this.<br><strong>???:</strong> You simply strike the ground as such. In this way, the noro is drawn out. And...<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> SHAA-!<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> KIKI....K-Ki-KIKIKIGIGIGIGI....<br><strong>???:</strong> You see?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> What the...!?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...Asakura-san!! Where she stabbed the ground, there's noro gathering...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> And it becomes aradama... What... So you've just been breeding aradama?<br><strong>???:</strong> Go, aradama, take revenge! They must be removed!

I have never thought to call myself anything, though... "Suruga". That is what they called me. That is my reply.<br><strong>Suruga:</strong> As to what I am, this will suffice....<br><strong>Suruga:</strong> Like you, I am one bound to the okatana.  </p><h2 id="3-what-humans-achieved-1" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>3: What Humans Achieved (1)</h2><p><strong>Suruga:</strong> Yes, I am the same as you.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Kuku...

We really are the same.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> "Really are the same"? What are you saying?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Like I said, we're the same. Isn't that right! The one they called Suruga! Renpu made you, didn't they?<br><strong>Suruga:</strong> Renpu... I see. You too were their guinea pig.<br><strong>Suruga:</strong> Girl, if they toyed with you as they did with me, come here. You may join me together in revenge!

Is this all toji of the Five Traditions can manage?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> What's with that armor? Is that her skin!? No matter how much we cut at it, it just keeps growing back!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Renpu went all out... No, is this what was born of the results of the Origami family's aradama research!?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Chii-nee... People keep saying guinea pig and research results and whatever, but what... What are you talking about!?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Just what you think. The Origami family took the aradama toji have defeated... Took their noro, and repeated various experiments with it.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Fusing noro with animals, to be used as controllable biological weapons. Injecting noro into toji, to draw out its power.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> In their experiments, they tried everything they could... No, even now they're still trying it. We at Osafune have been looking for a long time for concrete proof of it.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> But, that's insane... ...Wait!? Does that mean, the aradama Satsuki Yomi-san was using were...!?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Yes, without a doubt. The results of their research gone unchecked.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Heh, that's what I was saying. Satsuki Yomi shoots herself up with those drugs they squeeze out, and that's how she controls the aradama.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...This can't be real... I mean, we've all been fighting for the sake of justice... You can't tell me...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> So what!? Is she too... Is she one of the aradama the Origami family made!?  </p><h2 id="5-the-sweetness-called-revenge-1" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>5: The Sweetness Called Revenge (1)</h2><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> That makes her another victim of the Origami family and Renpu's aradama research, doesn't it...!?<br><strong>Suruga:</strong> Kuku.... Kukuku...! Victim, you said... You would actually call me a victim?<br><strong>Suruga:</strong> Aahh, you are right that I was born here, through what they called research. And, through what they called experiments, they would mutilate me...<br><strong>Suruga:</strong> Though... After failing to get the results they wanted, I found myself alone here.<br><strong>Suruga:</strong> This facility had been abandoned as well, as you can see from the state it is in. So, what is wrong with pursuing revenge with my newfound freedom?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> So that's your reason for using the Akabane swords, creating aradama, and attacking people?<br><strong>Suruga:</strong> Right. That is my revenge.<br><strong>Suruga:</strong> On the tongues that called me a waste. The ones that boasted they would "protect the people", all the while lying through their teeth. The Origami family... The toji... My revenge, turned against mankind!.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I understand. You've made your case. Yet...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> We cannot allow you, who would use aradama to attack innocent people, to continue on.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Wait, hang on! Suruga, she's still a victim here...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Asakura Mihono, do not allow yourself to be led astray. In the end, her reasoning still does not excuse her actions. There is nothing righteous about the things she has chosen to do.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Isn't that right, Suruga. In your using of the Akabane swords to gather noro and breed aradama, you had no right using them to attack innocent people.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> That is why we will put an end to this, and retrieve all the Akabane swords here!<br><strong>Suruga:</strong> I see.

In your right forearm, Bizen Osafune Yoshimitsu. In your right thigh, Aoe Shigetsugu. In your right lower leg, Udaku Nimune. Aside from those, there are 7 more... And in your spine, Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu... A replica.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I understand now. You are simply noro gathered around a skeleton of Akabane swords.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Far from being as complex as I thought, you are no different from the aradama born around the Akabane swords we have fought up until now.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I am quite interested in the details of how an aradama could become intelligent enough for human speech, however...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Against such a familiar opponent, the strategy becomes simple.

Fight back Suruga, prevent her from taking her grudge out on any more people, and retrieve the Akabane swords!  </p><h2 id="9--the-annihilating-blade---rondo-1" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>9- The Annihilating Blade - Rondo (1)</h2><p><strong>Mirja:</strong> Setouchi Chie! Push the attack forward! Shichonosato Kofuki, go wild! Until your utsushi runs out, act as berserk as you like! Musumi Kiyoka! Protect their backs!<br><strong>Chie/Kofuki/Kiyoka:</strong> Understood!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Mirja-san! What should I do!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Wait for my signal! Until then, gather your strength!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Eh... For what!?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> As noro gathers, it will become an "individual" and eventually take on a monstrous form. If you cut through this body, it will no longer be able to maintain that state and revert to its original one.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> However, things are different for a large aradama. The ordinary method is no longer effective with so much noro. As such...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> We will use our okatana to gradually wear away at Suruga's body. With nowhere left to go, the noro will gather closer towards a core in the center... Asakura Mihono, that's what you will aim for!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Alright... I can do that!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> A good reply.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Now, investigation team... Charge! This is the end! Cut open a path for Asakura Mihono!  </p><h2 id="10--the-annihilating-blade---rondo-2" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>10- The Annihilating Blade - Rondo (2)</h2><p><strong>Mirja:</strong> Asakura Mihono!

Power as a toji?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Mihono-chan... You're incredible! ...Ah!?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> ...An attack slipped through! From behind her!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...!?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (I can't block it right!)<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Mihono-chan's okatana flew out of her hands!?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Gh!

Let's go, Kiyomitsu... Let's finish this!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> AHHHHHHHHH!!!!<br><strong>Suruga:</strong> AAAAAGGGGGHHH...! AHHHHHHHHH...!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ......<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Phew...<br><strong>Suruga:</strong> ...You were... Asakura Mihono...?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Suruga!

Congratulations! You did it!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I did it... It wasn't a competition. Besides, we all won this together.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I know, but, congratulations!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Mmm------ Well, whatever. Thanks!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah! Oh yeah, Kiyoka, earlier you called me "Hono-chan", didn't you!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ~~~~~~! S-Sorry! I got carried away... It's just... I've been thinking, I wanted to call you that someday...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> So, I just...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> It's fine! Call me Hono-chan then! Also, at the end there, that was a really good throw! You got Kashuu Kiyomitsu right to me! I owe you one!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> No, well... That's about all I could do, so...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> ............Tch.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> It's over now, isn't it. Thank you very much, Setouchi Chie-san.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> I didn't really do anything worth thanking.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> More importantly, the Akabane swords here... There's only one, maybe two hundred. This is nowhere near all of them. So where did they come from, and how did they get here?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> You're right... But regardless, we need to call in for the swords here to be retrieved. Though... There is one thing I cannot understand about all this.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Suruga said... She was born here, as a victim of their experiments. But...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> You mean why, if Suruga was holed up here, our information misled us into coming here?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> No, there's that too, but much more confusing is... Why would Renpu leave Suruga here? How could her actions remain overlooked for so long?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> You're thinking that Renpu, knowing fully about the aradama they created here, intentionally left her to her own devices?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> On the contrary, I can't help but think the Origami family itself was involved in covering this up.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Whatever the case, it's beyond our ability to do anything about now. Though I am finding it difficult to trust Renpu, and, with their influence over the administration, hesitate at the thought of handing in these swords.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Because of that, I was wondering. Would you mind entrusting what we've found here directly to Ayanokouji Martial Arts School for the time being?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> ...I can't let you do that.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ...Setouchi Chie-san?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> I don't trust President Souraku yet either. I can't trust them with the Akabane swords. And... To tell the truth, I can't trust you either, Kitora Mirja.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> ..."Namu Yakushi Rurikou Nyorai Kagemitsu".<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> !?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> That's the name of the okatana you're here to recover, isn't it? Am I wrong?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> I know you've been looking for it. So... When President Souraku gets her hands on it, what is she going to do?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Chii-nee! Mirja-san! Let's get going alre...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Eh... Huh? Wait. What are you two doing...? Why are both of you readying your okatana!?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> I need you to tell me everything here, Kitora Mirja. What President Souraku... What Ayanokouji Martial Arts School is planning.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I see... Then, Setouchi Chie-san. I have questions as well. What are you?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Osafune gave us this lead intending to expose Suruga and the corruption of those in charge, didn't they. And you hid their true intentions when you led us here.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> In the first place, it was Osafune's Maniwa Sana who proposed the creation of this investigation team. So I have to ask, what is Osafune fighting against?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> ......<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ......<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> W-Wait! What's this all about!?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> She... Mirja-san was ordered by Ayanokouji's President Souraku to retrieve that okatana, "Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu".<br><strong>Chie:</strong> And she kept it a secret from us all this time.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Uhh... Chii-nee...? Is she not supposed to do that? I don't really get it, but if she wants it, why not let her take it?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> You would feel that way, Mihono-chan. But that's not how this works. I can't let her take it.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> When it comes down to it, I want you to explain. But you have two choices here: either you convince all of us to let you take it, or you take it from me by force.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Um, you two, could you please calm down and maybe talk this over? Ah! Shichinosato-san, help us stop them!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Huh? Just let 'em do what they want. This's getting interesting.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ehh!? S-Shichinosato-san... U-Um! Fighting amongst teammates is bad, you two! W-Why did it come to this...!?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> I wonder that myself, Kiyoka-chan. I wish this could have gone more smoothly. But this is something I'm not able to let her get away with.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I understand... The two of us both have reasons we can't afford to back down from. I had hoped it wouldn't come to this, but...　It seems this will only be settled through our okatana.<br><em>The two of them draw their swords</em></p><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> Chii-nee! Mirja-san! Cut it out! Actually, just get over it!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> We're only here to fight the aradama! Why are you two fighting each other!? Seriously! I don't get it!<br><em>Mihono draws her sword</em></p><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> Fine! If you two want to fight, then I'll fight you! You both have to get through me first! I won't use utsushi either! This is a fight for real!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Mihono-chan... Stay out of this.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> You can shut up, Chii-nee! Aghh, the sky can shut up too!<br><em>Helicopter noises</em></p><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> What is that sound anyway... A helicopter? Out the window, that's... The Special Ritual Riot Squad helicopter? What's it doing here, now...<br><strong>Yuzuki:</strong> That's far enough, Mirja. You, from Osafune, as well. Please put your okatana away.  </p><h2 id="12-what-each-were-after-2" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>12: What Each Were After (2)</h2><p><strong>Yuzuki:</strong> That's far enough, Mirja. You, from Osafune, as well. Please put your okatana away.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (That's... Ayanokouji Martial Arts School's President Souraku Yuzuki. This is the first time I've seen her in person...)<br><strong>Yuzuki:</strong> ...Yes, that is Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu... A secret weapon to be used against a great aradama. You've done well, Mirja. We can get a sword polisher to return it to its original state at once.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> ......!<br><strong>Yuzuki:</strong> Don't make such a scary face. I've already spoken to your President Maniwa in regards to this.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> With my president...? What do you mean?<br><strong>Yuzuki:</strong> All of you should listen closely.<br><strong>Yuzuki:</strong> Right now, a great aradama has its roots deep in our world. Very likely one that is greater and stronger than any humanity has ever faced.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ...President Souraku? What are you saying all of a sudden...<br><strong>Yuzuki:</strong> Do you not think it's strange?<br><strong>Yuzuki:</strong> The miraculous advancements made with computers and the discoveries involving the laws of physics. Even close to you, the creation of the tool that greatly supports a toji's abilities, Osafune's "Storm Armor".<br><strong>Yuzuki:</strong> Since the turn of the century, we have achieved things that should have been far beyond our reach. The likes of what were once pure science fiction.<br><strong>Yuzuki:</strong> Suppose all of this was due to the influence of an aradama? Suppose that, in our everyday lives, we are resting comfortably in the palm of an aradama's hand.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Wait... I mean, please wait. That's all hypothetical, right? Because, if you're telling the truth...<br><strong>Yuzuki:</strong> Then it would be necessary to find a means of retaliating against such a great aradama. A secret weapon humanity can keep close at hand. That's why... I believe there's nothing other than this Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu.<br><strong>Yuzuki:</strong> What do you think, Setouchi Chie. You must understand some of what I'm getting at.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> ...Yes. However, I want to take it with me to be sure.<br><strong>Yuzuki:</strong> I don't mind. Go right ahead.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Um, so does this mean... That our investigation team will be broken up here?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah! I didn't think of that! But we did collect the Akabane swords, and we did stop Suruga who was scattering them...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Yes. So it's over now, isn't it?<br><strong>Yuzuki:</strong> No, I would like for you to continue.<br><strong>Yuzuki:</strong> Your investigation into the Akabane swords will continue, operating under the supervision of the five presidents as before. You'll keep the relative independence to your investigation as well.<br><strong>Yuzuki:</strong> Additionally... I'd like to add an additional mission: locate Namu Yakushi Rurikou Nyorai Kagemitsu.<br><strong>Yuzuki:</strong> The Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu you found this time is still no more than a replica... Simply an imitation of the original, and nothing more.<br><strong>Yuzuki:</strong> You will track down the remaining Akabane swords, and among them you will find the true Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu.<br><strong>Yuzuki:</strong> And also, Setouchi Chie.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> ...Yes?<br><strong>Yuzuki:</strong> I'm leaving this okatana with you. As far as sword polishing goes, you could leave that to Mirja.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> As proof I can trust you... No, you're exchanging this for my trust. Is that what this means?<br><strong>Yuzuki:</strong> If that's how you see it then that's fine. Now then, this is where I take my leave.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Setouchi Chie-san. I...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> .........<br><strong>Chie:</strong> ...Sigh.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> I'm beat... All the tension's been sucked out of the air. There's no way I can continue our fight like this. So how about we call it a truce, for now?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Agreed. I'm very glad to hear that.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Everything's alright now!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Eh? Huh? What was all that?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> The hell, it's over already!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Aren't you happy, Shichinosato-san?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Huh? I don't really care!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Well I'm glad. Those two made up with each other, and we all get to be together a little longer.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I feel like we just started getting closer. That I want to be with everyone some more.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...Hah, that's so lame.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It is not!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I... I love Hono-chan, and Chie-san, and Mirja-san. Of course, I love you too, Shichinosato-san!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Hear that, Fukki-! Isn't it great that we don't have to break up~?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Huhh!? Who do you think you're calling Fukki!? Don't act like we're close...!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Huh~~? You're the one who told me to call you Fukki, remember, Fukki~~?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Nngh...!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Okay, okay, break it up, you two.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Okay~!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...'kay.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Fufu~. Now, leaving that aside...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> We can't hang around here forever. We can leave the recovery of the Akabane swords to the people at headquarters, so let's get going.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Normally we'd go right back to the office in Kamakura, but... I think we deserve a treat, so how about we go eat some sweets? I saw a crepe shop just by the station. What do you think, Captain Mirja?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Fufu, that sounds like a good plan. Then... One more time!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Investigation team! Move out, and recover the crepes!<br><strong>Mihono/Kiyoka/Chie:</strong> Yeah-!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...Yeah.
