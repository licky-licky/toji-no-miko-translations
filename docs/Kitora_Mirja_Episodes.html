There's been talk about how Nakano-san's aradama killcount hasn't been going up. What's your opinion on that, as her commander in the field?<br><strong>Kinuka:</strong> Don't you try to provide all the girls in your squad with equal opportunities in battle? So please, tell me what you think.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I don't mind, but... Is there really a problem with Nakano Jun? I don't believe there are many toji as capable as her.<br><strong>Kinuka:</strong> So you feel the same way... But, the big headed types at General Headquarters and the other commanding officers just don't get it.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Oh... I see.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Then, the next time we face aradama in battle, I'll place Nakano Jun at the center of our formation. Have headquarters monitor us, and ask commanders from other squads to review it as well.<br><strong>Kinuka:</strong> Are you sure that will convince them...?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> It would be wrong to get complacent, but I have faith in Nakano Jun. I'm almost certain I can prove her effectiveness beyond what a more haphazardly organized squad could manage.<br>On the day of a fight against aradama---</p><p><strong>Mirja:</strong> The plan is just as I've told you! Kitora Squad, spread out!<br><strong>Kitora Squad Members:</strong> Understood!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Nakano Jun!<br><strong>Jun:</strong> Aye!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> You're the key to our strategy today. Use your okatana as freely as you like!<br><strong>Jun:</strong> Sure thing; leave it to me.<br><strong>Jun:</strong> Would hate to have you all looking down on me. Aradama-han, don't think... You'll be coming past! Nakano Jun! So easy!<br><strong>Commanding Officer of the Special Ritual Squad:</strong> Don't tell me... Kitora Mirja! You can't expect her to deal with that many aradama by herself!<br><strong>Special Ritual Squad Operations Planner:</strong> But look... She's managing to hold her own. Actually, she hasn't been pushed back a single step...<br><strong>Kinuka:</strong> All by herself she managed to draw a line, and any aradama she lets through are easily defeated by the other toji.<br><strong>Kinuka:</strong> After all, there's no need for her to attack or kill aradama herself. This is the most effective way of using her.<br><strong>Commanding Officer of the Special Ritual Squad:</strong> I don't believe it!<br><strong>Kinuka:</strong> Oh, it seems to be already over.<br><strong>Jun:</strong> Last one! Letting it on by!<br><strong>Suzumoto Hana:</strong> Taking care of it! Haaa!<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> GYAAAAAAA!<br><strong>Kinuka:</strong> Fufu, would you look at that~. That's the result of thinking your tactics and strategies through~.<br><strong>Uraga Nao:</strong> Do you really think it's that easy? Most couldn't manage it. Something like that requires a lot of trust between everyone to work.<br><strong>Nao:</strong> I know I wouldn't be able to support a lone guard like that. Frankly, I think Mirja's the only one who could pull off such a risky strategy.<br><strong>Kinuka:</strong> Well, what's wrong with that! She's in Kitora Squad, after all!<br><strong>Kinuka:</strong> So long as she's there, Nakano-san can be used to her fullest potential! Am I wrong?<br><strong>Nao:</strong> ...Hey, Mizushina-san?<br><strong>Kinuka:</strong> Ah, Nao-san, you're still in work mode, I see~.<br><strong>Nao:</strong> Why do you... You keep sending unorthodox girls for Mirja to work with... What's your goal here?<br><strong>Kinuka:</strong> Fufu, you know me~. It's all for my cute little sister's sake, of course!<br><strong>Kinuka:</strong> I want Mirja's squad to get even stronger. To turn them into the safest and most capable place for my sister to join. That's my secret plan!<br><strong>Kinuka:</strong> Anyway, I'm done for the day~.  </p><h2 id="2-what-makes-up-mirja" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>2: What Makes Up Mirja</h2><p><strong>???:</strong> Kitora Mirja-senpai!<br><strong>Tomomu Niwa:</strong> Thank goodness I caught up to you! You forgot your phone in the briefing room!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Ahh, I must have. Thank you, you've really helped me out.<br><strong>Niwa:</strong> And, um... I'm sorry! To see whose phone it was, I took a look at your background photo.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I don't mind. You don't have to worry about it.<br><strong>Niwa:</strong> Ah, okay~! Um, there's something else I wanted to ask... Are the other people in the photo your family?<br><strong>Niwa:</strong> The one with the same hair color as you looked like your dad, and your mom seemed very pretty... And is that your grandpa by the furnace? He looks like a blacksmith!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Yes, my grandfather makes a living in Kyoto as a swordsmith. My father is from Finland, however... He admired Japanese swords so much that he came here to study under my grandfather as his apprentice.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> A lot of things happened and he became married to my mother, and those are my circumstances... You could say.<br><strong>Niwa:</strong> A Japanese sword family... I had no idea! Ahh! That's why you have the skills of a sword polisher, isn't it, Mirja-senpai? Does that mean... Did you want to specialize in that?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> That was what I had planned on doing, however...<br><strong>Niwa:</strong> I don't believe it! Mirja-senpai's a sword polisher just like me! That's so cool!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Now I'm retired from it. Though, my Jikkyuu Mitsutada was an Akabane sword I went through the process of restoring...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> When Mitsutada found me suitable, I saw the path of a toji open before me. Thanks to that, I am now simply a toji.<br><strong>Niwa:</strong> Hmm, Mirja-senpai, are you trying to convince yourself you don't regret leaving it behind?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> What do you mean?<br><strong>Niwa:</strong> No, I understand. Let's see... When I was in elementary school, I went on a field trip to Ooyamatsumi Shrine.<br><strong>Niwa:</strong> Ah, sorry to suddenly launch into a story about myself, but please listen. At the shrine, they had collected lots of rusted okatana.<br><strong>Niwa:</strong> At the time, I thought they could really use more help restoring those. On display in the corner, they had dozens of them lined up. Wouldn't that make you want to restore them to their former glory, Mirja-senpai?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> It would, but...<br><strong>Niwa:</strong> See! It really gets your sword polisher blood boiling, doesn't it? You can feel it too!<br><strong>Niwa:</strong> You'd feel like you have to polish those swords! After all, Mirja-senpai, I know you always carry a polishing toolkit with you wherever you go!<br><strong>Niwa:</strong> Once you feel that compulsion with fixing up swords, it never leaves you!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I'm not so sure...<br><strong>Niwa:</strong> Then why do you keep that with you?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ...Sigh, I can't convince you so easily, can I? As a toji, I do my best not to think about sword polishing any more, but...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> You're right. On the day I have to return my okatana to the Sword Administration, I plan on returning to my training as a sword polisher.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> To that end, while I may lack the time to improve myself, I at least cannot afford to let my skills grow dull.<br><strong>Niwa:</strong> I knew it!  </p><h2 id="3-whats-got-you-in-a-trance" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>3:　What's Got You in a Trance?</h2><p><strong>Mirja:</strong> Yes, the mountings of Shintougo Kunimitsu are a complete set, or so I've heard. For Kunimitsu, who specialized in daggers, to make a tachi, makes this an extremely peculiar item. Please handle it with the utmost care.<br><strong>Nagasaki Sumi:</strong> ...Ah, u-understood! I'll take good care of it!<br><strong>Sumi:</strong> (Which country is this assistant from...? She's so beautiful... It's making me really nervous!)<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> We look forward to seeing you again.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Thanks for coming by-!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> This is crazy, Mirja-san! Customers just keep coming in one after another!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Everyone gathered to see the Origami family's tournament, after all. Toji from across the country have gathered here in the Kanto region. I'm sure none of them want to pass up this opportunity while they're still in the area.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> But then again, that girl just now was from Renpu, wasn't she?<br><strong>Aoto Hina:</strong> Good work, you two. It's not over yet, but are you feeling worn out?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Thank you for your concern. Due to my unfamiliarity, I fear I made a few careless mistakes, however I no longer feel the nervousness I did this morning.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Though, it seems there are some people who don't feel such things in the first place.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Wait, Mirja-san, do you mean me?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> No, of course not. More importantly, Aoto Hina-san...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> As you are not only letting us stay overnight, but also providing me with this unique experience, you shouldn't feel the need to thank me.<br><strong>Hina:</strong> Aw, you're too sweet... No, you don't have to be like that, Mirja-san! You're already working for more than a hotel would cost, and you don't have to make it sound like a special experience or nothing.<br><strong>Hina:</strong> More importantly, you seem like the kind of girl who can really hold her drink. Am I wrong, Mirja-san?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> What are you saying...?<br><strong>Hina:</strong> No use hiding it! You keep up that poker face, but your eyes keep racing all over.<br><strong>Hina:</strong> Like they just can't settle on any one thing in here.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ...Asakura Mihono.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Y-Yes!?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I will take care of the customers. You should head into the back with the others and help Aoto Youji-san take inventory.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Uh, okay!<br><strong>Hina:</strong> Mihono-chan! If my pa's slacking off, give him a good kick for me! ...So now, Mirja-san~.<br><strong>Hina:</strong> What's got you so interested?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> There are materials here collected from across the country. Guards, braids, hilts, scabbards... I can't take my eyes off them.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Not just for okatana, but there are so many standard swords here as well. This is my first time seeing so many in one place. I feel deeply moved.<br><strong>Hina:</strong> Oh! Hun, you've got a real eye for detail~.<br><strong>Hina:</strong> You get it, you get it! Lately everything's been trending towards "if it's not an okatana, it's not a sword", but we've got an interest in plain old Japanese swordsmithing too!<br><strong>Hina:</strong> Though the Sword Administration's got their thumb on most okatana, so most everything you see on the market is just made of standard steel. But these are real works of art, and they've still got their own value as weapons!<br><strong>Hina:</strong> Hun, I wonder if you can handle your "swords" too?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Is that expression common in your line of work?<br><strong>Hina:</strong> Nah, just a favorite of mine.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> In truth, I think it's just as you've said, Hina-san. Among swordsmiths, the ones who made okatana have been remembered as legends, and have come to redefine the perception of a "sword".<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> However, the modern swordsmiths who have retained the old methods have then breathed new life into the traditional steel of antiquity.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> All in all, okatana cannot come to replace all swords. From old to new, they still have an equal amount of merit. That is what I believe.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> However... With antique steel, polishing can only get so far... Ah, not to demean the capabilities of sword polishers, but I'm a little out of touch with the practice myself.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> To make myself clear, with those methods of polishing, it can't help but reduce the overall texture and thickness of the blade.<br><strong>Hina:</strong> Hey, are you picking a fight with Hina-san, who's been studying sword polishing for 5 years now? Though I guess I'm still pretty fresh to it. Is it really that hard?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I see, you too... No, in the end, I'm only lamenting the extent of my own private interest in polishing.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> It's important not only to bring out the beauty, but the highest sharpness of the blade as well. In that regard, I can't help but scowl when I come across a crack in the edge.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ...I have to apologize. I may have been projecting too much, and for that I'm sorry. You see, in the past, I aspired to become a sword polisher as well...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> To tell you the truth, even my Jikkyuu Mitsutada was an Akabane sword I personally restored...<br><strong>Hina:</strong> Whoa, really!? That's so cool! Let me take a look...<br><strong>Matsunaga Yurina:</strong> ...Excuse me.<br><strong>Matsunaga Yurina:</strong> ...Umm.<br><strong>Matsunaga Yurina:</strong> ...I'd like to buy something.<br><strong>Matsunaga Yurina:</strong> ...Hey, you two!<br><strong>Matsunaga Yurina:</strong> ...HELLO!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> S-Sorry to keep you waiting-! The two at the desk seem to be locked in a conversation, so I'll try helping you-!  </p><h2 id="4-the-great-orange-battle-of-the-kotatsu" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>4: The Great Orange Battle of the Kotatsu</h2><p><strong>Uraga Nao:</strong> May I ask something~?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Go right ahead.<br><strong>Mizushina Kinuka:</strong> Feel free-. It's so calm and cozy in here-. Nice to get away from the hustle and bustle-.<br><strong>Nao:</strong> Why are the two of you in my kotatsu~?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> The answer is simple. After all, in this dormitory, the only one I'm aware of having brought such equipment in would be you, Uraga Nao.<br><strong>Nao:</strong> Mmm, don't you think you could show a little more restraint~?<br><strong>Kinuka:</strong> No way-. It's chilly out.<br><strong>Nao:</strong> My castle walls have crumbled~<br><strong>Kinuka:</strong> Now now, we wouldn't just impose on you like that. See... Ta-dah! Refreshments have arrived~<br><strong>Nao:</strong> Oranges!<br><strong>Kinuka:</strong> Well~? How do you feel now~?<br><strong>Nao:</strong> Ahh, my stomach has already decided for me~ I can't ignore your offering~<br><strong>Kinuka:</strong> With that, Kitora-san, our supply lines are secured.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I'd expect no less from one of General Headquarters' experts.<br><strong>Kinuka:</strong> Fufu, flattery will get you nowhere.<br><strong>Kinuka:</strong> Oh, that reminds me, have you two heard about this? There's people in headquarters asking to reconsider the standard battle formations.<br><strong>Kinuka:</strong> You know, how every unit in the Special Ritual Squad is based around the foundation of dividing roles into attacker, sub-attacker, and blocker?<br><strong>Kinuka:</strong> Well that's based off the model the army's special forces use, which was originally thought up with guns in mind.<br><strong>Kinuka:</strong> So there's a new wave of complaints coming up about how it doesn't really suit a practical situation for toji...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> But aren't things fine as they are now?<br><strong>Nao:</strong> You of all people shouldn't say that, Mirja~. Doesn't your squad disregard the standard formation as much as possible? As far as I can tell, that doesn't add up~?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> That's where you're wrong. I simply adjust each toji's responsibilities to suit their strengths as the situation needs it.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> And you're one to talk about disregarding theory, Uraga Nao. You tend to favor a strategy of encircling aradama, don't you?<br><strong>Nao:</strong> Because I know I can always win like that~. Anyway, there aren't many commanders as capable as you that can pull off your attitude in battle, you know~.<br><strong>Mizushina:</strong> Take it easy, you two. Look, the point I was trying to make is~ Hmm... How can I make this clear?<br><strong>Mizushina:</strong> Ah, I know just the thing! I'll explain it through oranges!<br><strong>Mizushina:</strong> Ta-da-da-dah! First, I'll write "attacker" on this one, and on its flank goes the "sub-attacker"... And after that... Huh? Where'd I put the attacker?<br><strong>Nao:</strong> (Chew Chew)<br><strong>Kinuka:</strong> Umm, well, I'll just deploy another attacker orange... Uh? Now where'd the blocker go?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> (Chew Chew)<br><strong>Kinuka:</strong> That's strange... Huh? I lost another attacker!? Ah...! Nao-san! Don't eat them!<br><strong>Nao:</strong> I just can't help it (Chew Chew), when you put an orange in front of me like that (Chew Chew), it's hopeless~ (Swallow)<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Uraga Nao (Chew Chew), don't you have any self control? No matter how much you (Chew) love them, the explanation cannot continue<br>(Chew) if you keep eating them (Chew Chew).</p><p><strong>Nao:</strong> ...(Chew Chew).<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ...(Chew Chew).<br><strong>Nao/Mirja:</strong> I can't believe you!<br><strong>Kinuka:</strong> Hey! You're in no place to judge!  </p><h2 id="5-what-does-a-mission-mean-to-you" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>5: What Does a "Mission" Mean to You?</h2><p><strong>Mirja:</strong> Setouchi Chie-san, there's something I don't understand. When you and I turned swords on each other, given the circumstances, I did not think I was mistaken in doing so.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> More than that, however... At the time, I felt there was a definitive difference between you and I. No, between myself and all the others.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> I think I get it... Mirja-san, what does a "mission" mean to you?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> My duty as a professional. Before, it meant leading my unit to success as a captain of the Special Ritual Squad. Now, it means guiding this investigation team in place of President Souraku.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> What of it?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> To me, a mission is an "ideal". To grow closer with to those I'm working with and achieve a great ideal we all share.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I don't quite understand the difference...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Does it sound too similar? Then... I supposed the difference is best expressed between "To carry out orders" and "To want to carry out orders".<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> .....<br><strong>Chie:</strong> For example...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> To Mihono-chan, a mission means to defeat aradama. Well, not quite... "To free everyone from being threatened by aradama" is more like it. Regardless of what anyone actually orders her, that's the mission she'll assign herself.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> To Kofuki-chan, a mission means "to kill every last aradama". That's also the same as her way of life. Because of that, I'm sure Kofuki-chan doesn't actually pay attention to what the mission specifies.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Kiyoka-chan has probably never been given a proper mission. She's said she's not even sure why she was picked to be a part of this investigation team.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Even so, President Gojou Iroha chose her to represent the Heijou Institute. Most likely because she has high expectations for Kiyoka-chan's skill with a sword...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Thinking that, President Gojou Iroha's unseen expectations most likely manifest as "the hopes she will return having overcome her weakness". So Kiyoka's mission is probably "to at least be able to fight".<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I see. They all... No, you as well, Setouchi Chie-san. Everyone aside from me acts in a way that seems very honest to themselves.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> However, I still cannot decide whether or not that's a good thing. Is the way I conduct myself really the best approach?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Who knows? At least, I can't answer that for you.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ...You're right. This doesn't seem like something anyone else can answer for me. Perhaps what's most important is to continue asking questions...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> But do things feel a little clearer now?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Yes. I've come to understand more of it. This may have seemed sudden, but I am still a novice at this.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> As such, it seems I'll have to learn more from everyone about how they live their lives.<br><div><iframe width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N8q9gtW9xcY"></iframe></div><br><strong>Valentines Part 1:</strong> Mirja-san's Unexpected Side<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I heard from Kohagura Ellen.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Several small aradama escaped from them. They seem to be headed our way.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Even though small aradama can only cause relatively little damage, things like this are bound to happen with so few of us to handle them...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Yes, and from the public's perspective, they feel threatened regardless of the severity, which can be troublesome. Especially in this case, which is causing so much unrest.<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> ...GYUAAAA!!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> They're here already.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> You take the lead in dealing with them. I'll be ready behind you, so don't feel that you have to force yourself.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Of course, I trust you'll take care of whatever I leave behind! --Let's begin our attack!<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> Shaaa...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Don't think you'll pass me so easily! --And you too!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Phew...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I've gathered the chocolate and packaging materials the aradama left behind.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Though, couldn't you have left some of the fighting to me back there?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I was able to attack with all I had knowing you would be supporting me.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> You can be unexpectedly aggressive at times. How surprising.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> In combat, I bear in mind that I need to calmly give orders. However, I won't deny I do feel that way inside.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Nice work, Hanahana, Mirja.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Thanks to you two, we managed to finish the battle without much damage to the mall!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I wanted to get all of them... They were so weak, but they kept moving all over.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> You can't exactly tell an aradama to sit still, after all.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> You may be strong, Tsubakuro Yume, but working as a team allows us to reduce the risks of danger or failure.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> But I want every chance I can get... To show how strong I am!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I think that will and ambition of yours to be strong is wonderful.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Next time an aradama shows up, just leave them to me. I won't screw up.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> In that case, while it's necessary to adapt to the needs of every situation, we can form our battle plan around you, Tsubakuro Yume.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I don't mind, but what do you two think?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I don't have any problem with it either.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Then that settles it! You better watch me close~.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Good. Now, why don't we return to the sweets shop. We also have a job to do there.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Before we start working, let's snack on some cake.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Certainly; the cakes they make do have exceptional flavor.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I see even you've turned into a big fan of theirs, Mirja.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> There's nothing wrong with having a sweet tooth.<br><strong>Valentines Part 2:</strong> Mirja-san is Meticulous<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I'll compile a report covering the progress the operation has made and the chocolate and packaging materials found from aradama.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> That would be a great help. If we could find some regularity to their behavior, it would make dealing with them in the future that much easier.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> That's what I hope to accomplish. Though, all we can do is pray the analysis team can bring back good findings. Anyway, you'll have to excuse me for the time being.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I'll start helping with the shop then.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Oh, Ellen-san.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Hey look, it's Kiyoka. What brings you here? Are you helping with the aradama too?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Sorry, I'm not, I'm just an ordinary customer. I found out about this shop from how popular it's been online and in magazines lately.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> And since Valentines is so close... I wanted, um... To look at some chocolate.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> You're good with girly things, aren't you, Kiyoka. Will it be a present for the person you like?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah, no... I-It's not like that, though I do admire them... This is for a female friend.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I see. What kind of chocolate would you reccomend in that case, Mirja?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah-! You look so cute in that uniform, Mirja-san!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Thank you. I thought it might be a little too cute for me, but I'm glad to hear you feel that way.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> A chic ensemble really suits you, but seeing you in such a cute style like that, you can definitely pull it off too!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I'd like to ask you about that another time then. But for now, allow me to make you some recommendations.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> First we have this chocolate ganache cake. The ganache is made using milk chocolate and cream, to give it a refined and pleasing sweetness that melts in your mouth.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> And here we have this layered chocolate cake, separated by framboise jam. From the sponge of the cake to the cream on top, the jam gives the chocolate a uniquely sweet accent that makes this a fine choice.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> As these are both in high demand, I recommend either of them. Though if you had something else in mind, I can propose something else.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Mirja-san... You're like a real shopkeeper.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> And I should mention, none of that was from the manual. It's all Mirja's personal recommendations...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I've been trying them during our breaks as well. Because of that, I thought I might as well use my experience to give a thorough explanation to curious customers.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That's just like you, Mirja-san. In that case, I think I'll go with the chocolate ganache cake. You made it sound delicious!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Thank you very much. With the chocolate cream, it would be best if you let the person you're giving it to know they should eat it as soon as possible.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Okay. I think they'll be happy with this.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Anyway, I'll see you later. Please do your best working both here and with your toji duties.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Kohagura Ellen. It's about time you started helping with our work here too.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> You seem like you're having no problem taking care of things by yourself, but I'll go get ready~.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> (Whether it be as a toji or as staff of this cake shop, I feel that I've done a good job today.)<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> No, the day isn't over yet. I can't let my guard down.<br><div><iframe width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vrh9FfXuL1I"></iframe></div>  </p><h2 id="new-years-mirja-start-mirjas-first-shrine-visit-of-the-year" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[New Year's Mirja: Start] Mirja's First Shrine Visit of the Year</h2><p><strong>Mirja:</strong> As one would expect, there are a great number of people out for New Year's Day.

What happened to the others?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> While you were talking, they all got swept away in the crowd!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I see.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> There's nothing we can do if we've already become separated. I'll notify everyone to make their first shrine visit on their own.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> So basically, that means I get to make my first shrine visit all alone with you?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> That's how it is.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Hyaa~! I'm so excited~!!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Yamashiro Yui, I propose we take measures to avoid splitting up any further. Put out your hand.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Y-You don't mean...!?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> We'll hold hands.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Ahh, give me a second, give me a second pleaseee! I'll take my glove off right now!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Wh-What do I do about my hand sweating... Ahh, Mirja-san's hand, it's so rough... Wait, you're wearing a glove!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Will you please wear a glove as well? Your hand will get frostbite.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> After you put your glove back on, we'll get in line to visit the shrine.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Wha-- You mean that line that looks like it'll for sure take an hour to get through!? You know that lovers always break up because of long waits in lines, don't you!?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> We came here to make our first shrine visit, so of course I do. And also, where did you learn that statistic?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> From my own research!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> And so, for the sake of our future together, we should go draw our fortunes first!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> ...Mirja-san, isn't it kind of like we're on a date together?  Kyaa! I said it!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Is the short performance over now? If so, let's draw our fortune slips.    [The term Mirja uses, koshibai, literally small play, refers to plays that were too small to be performed in theaters and were traditionally held at shrines.]<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Hm, mine reads "great fortune". That's how it is then.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> You got a great fortune, Mirja-san?

At this shrine, they have an offering box where you can deposit misfortune and great misfortune slips.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> After doing that, your great misfortune is meant to turn into great strength.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> I'll go put my great misfortune in the box right away!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> If you run, you'll trip and fall.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Don't worry!

I'll be there to protect your pale skin, Mirja-san...!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Until I rub sunscreen all over you with my own hands!!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Anyway, because it's down by the river, the air here is cooler than I expected.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> And there's such fine weather today.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> That's for sure, it is really nice out...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ......In spite of that, it looks to me like you're struggling quite a bit?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> That's because... I couldn't sleep much last night, and I didn't eat breakfast either...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Honestly... Here, have this.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Is that ramune? Thanks......<br><strong>Yui:</strong> PFHAGH!?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> What's with this!? It's sweet and sour and bitter and solid and salty and sourly sour!?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> It's the ramune Ban Tsugumi gave me to combat the summer heat.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Kn-Knowing that it's Tsugumi-san's... I'm not surprised it's awful...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ...It looks like it was a little overwhelming.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Why don't we stop and take a short rest here?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Sounds great!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Mirja-san, since we're already in our swimsuits, let's go in the river!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ......<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Do you not want to...?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> No, it is what we came here for, so I'll enjoy myself as well.  </p><h2 id="swimsuit-20---mirja-end-a-short-rest" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Swimsuit 20 - Mirja: End]: A Short Rest</h2><p><strong>Yui:</strong> YAHOOO-!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Phew... This feels so good...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Mirja-saaan! Hurry up and come in the river!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ......<br><strong>Yui:</strong> ...?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> What are you just staring at the water for-!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ...The wildlife in this mountain river must be abundant.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Where'd that come from...?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> They moved away when you jumped in, but I saw the shapes of fish swimming.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I didn't exactly get a good look at them... Given the season, perhaps they were Ayu?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> You think so?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> You can also catch Amago, Yamame, and Iwana during the summertime. Though, I'm unsure if those fish would be in this river here...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> We should've brought a fishing rod with us. If there were that many fish, we might've been able to go all out for our lunch.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> True, we potentially could have, though... As beginners, I'm not sure how many we would be able to fish out...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Well, forget about that for now; hurry up and come in the water!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Alright then... Mm!?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> What's wrong?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Just now, a spider went drifting by.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> A spider!?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Wh-Wh-Wh-Where was it!?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> It's about to pass right in front of you.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Eh? ...GYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Mirja-san, there's a spider! A spider!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> It isn't a venomous spider, so you shouldn't worry. It won't harm you.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> That doesn't help! There's no maiden in the world who'd keep calm with a spider in front of their face!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Can I hug onto you for safety!?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Absolutely not.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Looking around more, there sure are a lot of bugs... Eep!?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> We are out in nature, so that's only natural.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Phew, that was a good rest. Now then, to continue our stroll.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> You aren't getting in after all!?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> You were just toying with me, Mirja-san~! But, you treating me like that feels pretty nice too!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ...What are you talking about?

At the Nine Schools Competition, I finished with a perfect bullseye. With a "bang!"<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Going back, what is this Nine Schools Competition?<br><strong>Mayumi:</strong> Ah, that's right, you wouldn't have a Nine Schools Competition here.<br><strong>Mayumi:</strong> If I say it's... a competitive magic tournament, does that make it easy to picture?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Yes, that's easily understandable.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Hm... With that magic, you would be highly beneficial when fighting against aradama...<br><strong>Mayumi:</strong> Anyway, putting that aside, are you feeling peckish? It's about lunchtime, isn't it?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> You're right, now would be a good time for it.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Oh, that's... Asakura Mihono with Shiba Miyuki.<br><strong>Mayumi:</strong> They seem to be enjoying themselves quite a lot, though, I wonder what they're talking about?<br><strong>Mayumi:</strong> Let's go see, Kitora-san.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> You look like you're having a good time, Asakura Mihono.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah, Mirja-san, Mayumi-san!<br><strong>Mayumi:</strong> What were you talking about with Asakura-san, Miyuki-san?<br><strong>Miyuki:</strong> I was just speaking a little about Onii-sama.<br><strong>Mayumi:</strong> About Tatsuya-kun?<br><strong>Academy Announcement:</strong> An appearance of aradama has been confirmed. Please prepare to sortie at once. I repeat--<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Aradama!<br><strong>Mayumi:</strong> We'll lend a hand. Won't we, Miyuki-san?<br><strong>Miyuki:</strong> Yes, of course.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ...That would be helpful.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> In that case, Shiba Miyuki, I leave you with Asakura Mihono. Saegusa Mayumi will be with me.<br><strong>Mihono/Miyuki:</strong> Right.<br><strong>Mayumi:</strong> Will pairing off like this be alright?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> While magic may not be able to exorcise aradama, Shiba Miyuki's magic is effective against them.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Paired with Asakura Mihono, she should be able to cover for her, just in case.<br><strong>Mayumi:</strong> You really are considerate of your kouhai, aren't you, Kitora-san. I had pictured you as someone more logically driven.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Logically driven...? It's true that Asakura Mihono is a valuable member of our investigation team.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Though, Saegusa Mayumi. If I had left Asakura Mihono with you, I don't believe you would let anything go wrong either.<br><strong>Mayumi:</strong> I'm honored to hear it. Well, let's get going.  </p><h2 id="mahouka---mirja-end-elven-sniper" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Mahouka - Mirja: End]: Elven Sniper</h2><p><strong>Mirja:</strong> Now then, Saegusa Mayumi. The two types of magic you explained to me before... Magic Bullet Shooter and Multi-Scope.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> With those two, we should be able to suppress aradama with ease.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> After all, you are capable of carrying out a one-sided assault on aradama from distance without needing to enter their range.<br><strong>Mayumi:</strong> That's true.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Then I will be the one to perform the finishing blow...<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> GGGGGOOOOOUUUUU!!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> -! Saegusa Mayumi!<br><strong>Mayumi:</strong> Of course.<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> GUOOO!?<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> GYAAA!?<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> OOOOO!?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> She took care of three simultaneously..<br><strong>Mayumi:</strong> Two more are coming from the front, and another three from the right hand side. I'll pin them down, so could you please finish off those three?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I'm on it!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> HAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> (A perfect bullseye, hm... Her precision is frightening.)<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ...There's nothing that could be more reassuring.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> YAAAAAAAAAAAA!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> We finished suppressing the aradama, Mirja-san! Miyuki-san was really incredible!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> We can speak about that more later. Then, when we next meet.<br><strong>Mayumi:</strong> It sounds like Asakura-san and Miyuki-san safely suppressed their aradama too.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Yes, though Asakura Mihono's strange excitement has me concerned...<br><strong>Mayumi:</strong> You think she might have fallen in love with Miyuki-san's magic?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> That might be the case. Though, you were excellent yourself, Saegusa Mayumi.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I didn't think that, just by having long range support, it would make such a dramatic difference in efficiency...<br><strong>Mayumi:</strong> Would you try recreating it after you wake up from this dream?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> That would be difficult to accomplish. Multi-Scope and Magic Bullet Shooter.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I believe this was only possible because of how skilled you are at manipulating the both of them.<br><strong>Mayumi:</strong> Thank you for the compliments, Kitora-san.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I meant it. That aside, the aradama interrupted us when we were about to have lunch just now.<br><strong>Mayumi:</strong> They did; I'm famished at this point. Even though it's a dream. It's a strange feeling, isn't it?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I feel the same.

We'd very much like your help, Miss Kitora!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I'm not against helping you, but, sadly, I don't know much about motorcycles.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Why not ask someone more suited for this? Someone like Inago Akira should be up to the task.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Actually, we asked Boss, but she couldn't make it...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> You're the only one we can turn to, Mirja-san!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> And anyway, what we're missing is someone to help draw in visitors, so it's not like you even need to know about motorcycles!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ......<br><strong>All 3:</strong> Please help us!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ...Fine then. If you're that set on it, I'll help you out.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Hooray-! This is why I love you, Mirja-san!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Morishita Kihiro, Haji Keiko.

Take a look, Mirja-san! This is it!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> To sum it up... I wear this, sit on the motorcycle, and attract people...<br><strong>Kihiro:</strong> As a staff member attracting visitors in the broadest sense, you're our billboard.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ...<br><strong>Keiko:</strong> I-I'm sorry... We were actually going to hire a professional to do this...<br><strong>Kihiro:</strong> You see, while building the motorcycle, my gen~ius instincts went and caught fire.<br><strong>Kihiro:</strong> And, while remodeling here and there, we completely spent through our budget.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> That's when I happened to hear about all this, and thought, why not ask Mirja-san?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> With your bombshell body, there's no way you wouldn't look great in it!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ...Unbelievable.<br><strong>Keiko:</strong> Um... Are you not going to do it afer all...?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> No, I will. I wouldn't turn you down after coming this far.

Would you mind giving a look over this way-?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Li... like this?<br><strong>Cameraman:</strong> Thanks a lot! That's perfect!<br><strong>Man:</strong> Hey, check out the cowling on that bike...! The design, materials, functionality; they're all first rate.<br><strong>Woman:</strong> I can tell.
