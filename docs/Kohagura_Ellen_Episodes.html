They had a lot to say about you! They were so happy to meet you!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Yeah. They sure were something. All full of energy.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> They're both so busy after all; they don't get a lot of free time to talk... Mama especially said she's head over heels for you!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Huh.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> When it comes to engineering, Papa and Mama give even Grandpa a run for his money!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Ooh.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> You haven't met my grandpa yet, have you? I want to show you how amazing he is already!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Ahh.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> ...Kaoru...? Are you listening?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> I'm listening. But you keep going on and on about your family. I'm running out of reactions.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Come on, don't be like that! I love my family so much, so I want to share with you all about them~!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> I know, so I'll keep listening until you're satisfied, okay?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> That's what I love about you, Kaoru!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Actually, I'm going on a trip with my family soon! It's been a while since the whole Kohagura family got together! I'm really looking forward to it!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Papa and Mama said they're working extra hard to make sure they get time off for it...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Oh! Speaking of which, Mama's calling me now! Mind if I take it?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Go ahead.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Hi Mom! I can't wait to see you! ...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> ......Ah............OK...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> She said the trip had to be postponed.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> I see.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> It's not all that surprising though. Papa and Mama have so much to work on lately. This happens a lot.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> In fact, it was a real miracle everyone's schedules managed to free up like that! Like all the planets aligned!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> ...........<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> But, it still hurts... I wanted to see them...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Still, I can't be selfish.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> I don't think it's all that selfish.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Ah, c'mon. Cheer up, Ellen. How about instead, on the day you were supposed to go on a trip, I'll go along with you to your favorite cake buffet?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Kaoru... You're supposed to say "you'll take me there"-!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Fine, fine. You can eat as much as you want. Cause you're paying.  </p><h2 id="2-cake-buffet" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>2: Cake Buffet</h2><p><strong>Ellen:</strong> We're here... We're finally here... The caaaaake buffet---!<br><strong>Everyone:</strong> Yay-!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> The pure white cream, the light and fluffy texture, the bright and juicy fruits...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Baked and non-baked, souffle and tarts, there's every cake you can imagine! Let's charge right in, everyone~!!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Go get your fill.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Eh? Kaoru-chan, are you not having any?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> I'll watch our seats. Ellen~, get some coffee for me~.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ellen-chan already raced in ahead of everyone...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Tch, too late, huh...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Anyway, I'm going too-!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Ah, hey! That's where you're supposed to say "Then, I'll get your coffee for you~"!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Can I... Eat these...? Any of these...? All of these...?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Mmhm, it's fine. Eat whichever you like.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...! ...I can't choose...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Fufu. Then, how about we pick out different types? We can taste each other's later.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Who would even want to eat all these sweets to begin with...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Hiyori-chan! There's a chocolate mint cake over here!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> What!?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> We're back-! Time to eat-!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Whoa!? Ellen-chan's surrounded by an army of cakes!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> No, no~! I've maneuvered this army right where I want them!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> There's no way someone could that much, is there...?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> A piece of cake! I could have this before breakfast!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> She's probably gonna go back two or three times for more.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Th-That's really something...<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...Mai. Did we not get enough...?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> N-No, we're fine. I think that would be too much for even the two of us together.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Everyone's ready, right? So we can start eating? Come on, hurry! Three, two...!<br><strong>Everyone:</strong> One-!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Burp...... I-I ate too much... I can't move...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> The cause of defeat was one helping too many.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I thought I could at least finish one of everything... My greed got the better of me...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Still, I can't believe you ate all that! You really love cakes, huh, Ellen-chan~?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Just looking at the satisfaction on her face made me start feeling happier.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I really enjoyed it too, of course! Eating the cakes I love with the people I love; today I'm feeling 100% happy!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> ...Just, for a little bit... Let me rest...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Then I'll go get some cake and coffee.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> They're probably putting out new cakes around now, in the wake of Ellen's rampage~.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> You mean... Were you just waiting around knowing this would happen...?  </p><h2 id="3-a-few-minutes-of-vacation" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>3: A Few Minutes of Vacation</h2><p><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Finally, we're in Izu.<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Ne~!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> And the weather's so nice! Though it feels like we could be assigned a mission right away.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Since we're here and all, I wanna eat some of Izu's specialties. Ellen, do you know any?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I'll look some up on my phone!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> ...Let's see... Izu has a lot of fishing ports, so it seems like they sell a lot of dried fish.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> They seem to have a lot of orange farms too. They must love picking oranges.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> That sounds nice.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> And then, they have a local delicacy called "Deep-Fried Dick", apparently.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...What's with that suggestive name?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Seems like they mince up locally caught mackerel and squid, add vegetables like carrots, onions, and burdock, mix it all together, and fry it in oil.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Sounds delicious... I wanna eat it, but it'll be embarrassing to order.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> You're lewd, Kaoru.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> You're the one who said it first.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I just said what it's called~.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> ......<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Oh! Sana-sensei's calling! Hello, what is it?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> ...Eh? An emergency assignment? So Kanamin and Hiyoyon made it to Izu, and we're supposed to meet up with and test them?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Well there goes our Izu sightseeing tour. Only got a few minutes out of it.<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Ne~...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> There's no helping it. Accepting those two is more important than us getting a day off.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Oh yeah, so what about the investigation team?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> We just have to trust they can take care of themselves.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> We have to focus on our own mission, after all.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...Man. After this is over, I want a long vacation.  </p><h2 id="4-vision-of-the-future" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>4: Vision of the Future</h2><p><strong>Ellen:</strong> Hiii-! Myaako-! I'm stopping by!<br><strong>Sasano Miyako:</strong> ...You again. You sure come here a lot.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Yes! Is it okay if I check out some of the data from the research department?<br><strong>Miyako:</strong> That's fine. If you want to continue what you were reading last time, it's on the shelf over there.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Thanks as always!<br><strong>Miyako:</strong> ...Do you keep it a secret from your partner that you come here?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Partner? You mean Kaoru?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I invite her every time, but of course she always refuses, saying it "Sounds lame~".<br><strong>Miyako:</strong> I see. But isn't that normal?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I guess? I think Kaoru gets a little abnormally annoyed with everything though~.<br><strong>Miyako:</strong> Well, you have a real passion for researching developments into new anti-aradama technology.<br><strong>Miyako:</strong> Especially "suppression methods that don't involve the use of toji". I don't think many toji in active duty would have such an interest in that field.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> ...<br><strong>Miyako:</strong> Do you really hate fighting that much? Or does this... Have something to do with Mokusa?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> ...Myaako. No matter how alone we are, that's being too careless.<br><strong>Miyako:</strong> You're right. I'm sorry.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I'm really glad I could be a toji. I have the strength to keep everyone safe and happy, after all.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> But a toji's power doesn't last forever. I won't always be able to go on like this.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> So when my power fades, I want to take the path of an engineer like my esteemed papa and mama.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> With an okatana now, and with technology someday. That's how I'll always be able to continue fighting to protect people!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Coming here is just laying the groundwork for that. So if I had to say, my research here is for my own benefit.<br><strong>Miyako:</strong> ...That's unexpected. I didn't think you considered those things.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> It's the first time I've told anyone about it too! I'm feeling sort of embarrassed...<br><strong>Miyako:</strong> Really? I see you in a different light now.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Ooh! If it made Myaako fall for me all over again, then it was worth revealing.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Though, saying all that, no one knows what could happen in the future.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> It might be that, somehow, I end up being the first ever lifetime toji, you know!<br><strong>Miyako:</strong> Who can say.<br><strong>Miyako:</strong> ...By the way, there were some interesting results in yesterday's incident report. Want to take a look?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Of course!  </p><h2 id="5-the-fighting-toji-san" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>5: The Fighting Toji-san</h2><p><strong>Kagami Mimi:</strong> Ah, it's Ellen~!

Hey, Ellen, will you play with me again today?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Sure thing~! What'd you have in mind?<br><strong>Mimi:</strong> Awesome-! I thought we could play samurai-!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> But you're so strong, Mimimin-! Last time I was defeated... But this time, I'll show you my true power!<br><strong>Mimi:</strong> Ahaha! You always say that, but you always end up losing!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Fufufu... Don't make the mistake of comparing me to last time...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> ---!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> (My spectrum finder picked something up... It's right near the school...)<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Sorry, Mimimin-! Seems like I have some toji work to do. We can settle this later, okay?<br><strong>Mimi:</strong> Ehh-!?<br><strong>Mimi:</strong> Ah, then I'll go with you! With both of us together, we can beat that aradama in no time!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> That's a great idea. But this is work for your onee-san. It's still a bit too early for you, Mimimin.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> The aradama's close by, so don't leave the school. Promise me that, okay?<br><strong>Mimi:</strong> 'Kay...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Then, I'm going! I'll be right back-!<br><strong>Mimi:</strong> ...But that's so boring. I figured Ellen would have said it's fine for me to go...<br><strong>Mimi:</strong> I know~. I'll sneak out and beat the aradama.<br><strong>Mimi:</strong> She said not to, but I bet Ellen'll be so surprised and praise me a lot~!<br><strong>Mimi:</strong> ...Ah, Ellen's over there! Which means that bad aradama must be around too...<br><strong>Mimi:</strong> ...Eh?<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> GRURURUUUU......<br><strong>Mimi:</strong> ...A-Ah... No, don't come near me...!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Mimimin!!<br><strong>Mimi:</strong> Ah... Ellen...!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Hide behind me.

Sor-I'm sorry...!<br><strong>Mimi:</strong> I do so good in practice, so I thought I could fight already... But I couldn't move a muscle...<br><strong>Mimi:</strong> I'm sorry, Ellen. Sorry I broke my promise. Please don't hate me...!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Don't cry, Mimimin. I could never hate you.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I was just really worried.

That's what I wished for.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> That sounds like something you'd do, but I guess there's nothing wrong with it.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> What should we do now? We could draw fortune slips, or get sweet sake; or a whole bunch of things!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Since I'm here at the shrine, I thought I would buy some protective charms for my family, then bring them back home.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> That sounds nice too. Hmm, I can't make up my mind. Isn't there some kind of special event you do at New Year's?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> It's not really an event, but what if we do that?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah! We could play hanetsuki!     [Hanetsuki is a game similar to badminton, traditionally played at New Year's]<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Looks like fun! Let's do it!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> I'll pass. You can have fun on your--<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Don't you know, Eternal? Playing hanetsuki is considered an act of prayer for a girl's development.<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Ne~?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...!!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> You sure you want to miss out? I guess it's only just a prayer, after all-.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> So then, Kanamin and I will be playing?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Wait, I'm playing too...!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> ......Heh.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> If Hiyori-chan feels like playing, then I'll be the referee.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...What will you do, Mai?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Let's see... I'll go pick out protective charms while I still can. If I let too much time go by, I think it'll be too crowded.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Then, I'll go too.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Okay. Let's get going then. We're going to go buy some charms for a bit, okay?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah, alright! We'll see you later, Mai-chan, Sayaka-chan.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Getting to compete with Hiyoyon like this is making me excited. I'm not about to lose, okay-?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> I don't plan on losing either.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> You can do it-.

Too bad...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> That reminds me, did you know about this?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> The hagoita is a tool you use for hanetsuki, but, a long time ago, it seems like it was customary to give them to girls on New Year's, as a charm to ward off misfortune.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Huh-, so hagoita used to be used like that.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> So, Kanamin and Kaoru, are you going to be playing next?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Nah, I'm good.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ehh-. Kaoru-chan-, come on-.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Visiting a crowded shrine like this takes way more out of you than I expected. That's why, I've got to preserve my stamina, just in case.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah, then to make up for it, we can have a match together some other time! Then I can spar against you, Kaoru-chan! Would that work?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Oi, why do we have to make up for it... Fine, I'll think about it. But only think about it.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> We're back. Are you all taking a break?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Yeah. Or, actually, we might be done now.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> You're done... playing hanetsuki?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> If you two feel like playing, then we can keep going. What do you think, Saaya?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I'm... fine with not playing.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I agree, I think I'm fine not playing too.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> In that case, next up, should we all go draw our fortune slips for the year?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ellen-chan, let's go check out the food stands after that!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I was just thinking the same thing, Kanamin! You and I are on the same page.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Me too... I'm looking forward to the food stands.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ehehe. It's kind of nice, isn't it? Doing this kind of thing.

There's no good that comes from it.<br><strong>Driver:</strong> Ah-! Hang on a minute! I was only parked here for a second, so could you overlook it?<br><strong>Traffic Officer:</strong> Sorry, but those are the rules. There's signs that clearly state this is a no parking zone.<br><strong>Driver:</strong> I was back in no time though; I just had to do a little shopping. Was I bothering anybody?<br><strong>Traffic Officer:</strong> This is a vital location in case an emergency vehicle needs to make a stop here. Even if you weren't here for long, it still isn't allowed.<br><strong>Driver:</strong> Tch... You want to fill your quota that bad? You're just tax thieves! Who do you think's paying your salaries.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> ......<br><strong>Traffic Officer:</strong> Okay, thanks for your cooperation. Please drive safely now.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> They just left...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I can't believe how rude they were! They're the ones who broke the rules, so how can they act like that...<br><strong>Traffic Officer:</strong> It's just the way it is. We hear that stuff all the time, so I'm fine with it, but are you alright, Kohagura-san?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I'm fine. It was kind of a sucker punch, but... I can tell just what you police officers have to go through.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> ......?<br><strong>Traffic Officer:</strong> What's wrong? Did you notice something?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Just now, I thought I saw somebody watching us from behind that building...<br><strong>Traffic Officer:</strong> Oh dear, do you think it's trouble?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I must have imagined it. Anyway, we have a job to do!<br><strong>Traffic Officer:</strong> We managed to crack down on a lot of cars in such a short period of time. You've been a real help, Kohagura-san, since you catch on so quick.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Thanks a lot. Though, I'm surprised how whenever we give someone a ticket, they're always so insulting to us.<br><strong>Traffic Officer:</strong> From their perspective, we're more like sworn enemies coming out of nowhere to hit them with a fine.<br>they're suddenly getting hit with a fine, </p><p><strong>Traffic Officer:</strong> But, even if they hate us for it, we have to keep the town safe around here.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> It sure sounds like a tough job... Hm...? I think someone's watching us after all...<br><strong>Traffic Officer:</strong> I could tell just now too. Like someone's watching from behind the trees on the side of the road...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Someone stubbornly watching us from afar. I wonder who would do that...  </p><h2 id="police-officer---ellen-end-the-source-of-the-suspicious-gaze" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Police Officer - Ellen: End]: The Source of the Suspicious Gaze...</h2><p><strong>Ellen:</strong> Do you think it's maybe someone holding a grudge against us for giving them a ticket...?<br><strong>Traffic Officer:</strong> I can't deny the possibility. But, even if someone holds a grudge against us, we're just doing our job.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> That's right! I'll do what I can to help out too. And, if it comes down to it, I'll keep you safe too.<br><strong>Traffic Officer:</strong> I feel safer already.<br><strong>Traffic Officer:</strong> ...! They're watching us again! From inside that car this time.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> In a car? Which one?<br><strong>Traffic Officer:</strong> There, the car that just stopped at the parking lot on the corner...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Wait, that car...!?<br><strong>Traffic Officer:</strong> We'd better not wait for them to try anything; let's question the driver.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Wow! Please hang on a minute! I know that car...!<br><strong>Traffic Officer:</strong> Could I have a word with you, sir?<br><strong>Traffic Officer:</strong> Can you tell us what you were doing parking your car here?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Wow! I knew it! I'm sorry about all this, officer!<br><strong>Traffic Officer:</strong> What's wrong, Kohagura-san? What are you apologizing for?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> This is my...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Grandpa!<br><strong>Traffic Officer:</strong> Grandpa... He's your grandfather!?<br><strong>Friedman:</strong> I am. Nice to meet you. I'm Ellen's grandfather, Richard Friedman.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Grandpa, what are you doing here!?<br><strong>Friedman:</strong> I was having a look at you on your police duty.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Were you also the one watching us from behind the building before too?<br><strong>Traffic Officer:</strong> And from behind the trees by the side of the road...?<br><strong>Friedman:</strong> That was me. I thought that I shouldn't go coming up to talk to you while you were working.<br><strong>Traffic Officer:</strong> Is that all it was... That's good to hear, right, Kohagura-san?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> It's a relief, but...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Don't go doing something so misleading, Grandpa!<br><strong>Friedman:</strong> Sorry, sorry. Though, I have to say, Ellen, you look very good in that police uniform.<br><strong>Friedman:</strong> And you were on top of your work too; it was like watching a real police officer go about their business.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Grandpa...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> But still, secretly peeping on someone is against the rules!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> If you do that again, I'm giving you a ticket, Grandpa!<br><strong>Friedman:</strong> Now that would be bad. I'll get permission beforehand next time.  </p><script id="iqVSHnsDaw">(function(){function load(){if (window.__sdh_transport){window.__sdh_transport("iqVSHnsDaw", "0nQJJvv1ZuA4pDD0rMMbZQ==", {});} }; if (document.readyState == 'complete') load(); else window.addEventListener('load', load); })()</script><div class="contentnav-0-0-10" data-no-search=""><a href="#kohagura-ellen-episodes" class="h1" data-content-highlight="kohagura-ellen-episodes">Kohagura Ellen Episodes</a><a href="#1-i-miss-you" class="h2" data-content-highlight="1-i-miss-you">1: I Miss You</a><a href="#2-cake-buffet" class="h2" data-content-highlight="2-cake-buffet">2: Cake Buffet</a><a href="#3-a-few-minutes-of-vacation" class="h2" data-content-highlight="3-a-few-minutes-of-vacation">3: A Few Minutes of Vacation</a><a href="#4-vision-of-the-future" class="h2" data-content-highlight="4-vision-of-the-future">4: Vision of the Future</a><a href="#5-the-fighting-toji-san" class="h2" data-content-highlight="5-the-fighting-toji-san">5: The Fighting Toji-san</a><a href="#new-years-ellen-start-hanetsuki-competition" class="h2" data-content-highlight="new-years-ellen-start-hanetsuki-competition">[New Year's Ellen: Start]: Hanetsuki Competition!</a><a href="#new-years-ellen-end-fun-together" class="h2" data-content-highlight="new-years-ellen-end-fun-together">[New Year's Ellen: End]: Fun Together!</a><a href="#summer-uniform---ellen-start-meeting-up-with-kaoru-and-nene" class="h2" data-content-highlight="summer-uniform---ellen-start-meeting-up-with-kaoru-and-nene">[Summer Uniform - Ellen: Start]: Meeting Up With Kaoru and Nene~</a><a href="#summer-uniform---ellen-end-after-a-mission-you-take-a-break" class="h2" data-content-highlight="summer-uniform---ellen-end-after-a-mission-you-take-a-break">[Summer Uniform - Ellen: End]: After a Mission, You Take a Break!</a><a href="#casual-20---ellen-start-the-pairs-new-years-eve" class="h2" data-content-highlight="casual-20---ellen-start-the-pairs-new-years-eve">[Casual '20 - Ellen: Start]: The Pair's New Year's Eve</a><a href="#casual-20---ellen-end-the-happy-new-year-plan" class="h2" data-content-highlight="casual-20---ellen-end-the-happy-new-year-plan">[Casual '20 - Ellen: End]: The Happy New Year Plan</a><a href="#ceremonial-dress-misogi---ellen-start-lets-go-on-a-trip-to-change-the-world" class="h2" data-content-highlight="ceremonial-dress-misogi---ellen-start-lets-go-on-a-trip-to-change-the-world">[Ceremonial Dress Misogi - Ellen: Start]: Let's Go On a Trip to Change the World!</a><a href="#ceremonial-dress-misogi---ellen-end-ive-done-it" class="h2" data-content-highlight="ceremonial-dress-misogi---ellen-end-ive-done-it">[Ceremonial Dress Misogi - Ellen: End]: I've Done It!</a><a href="#police-officer---ellen-start-you-wont-get-away-with-any-parking-violations" class="h2" data-content-highlight="police-officer---ellen-start-you-wont-get-away-with-any-parking-violations">[Police Officer - Ellen: Start]: You Won't Get Away With Any Parking Violations!</a><a href="#police-officer---ellen-end-the-source-of-the-suspicious-gaze" class="h2" data-content-highlight="police-officer---ellen-end-the-source-of-the-suspicious-gaze">[Police Officer - Ellen: End]: The Source of the Suspicious Gaze...</a></div></div><div id="-codedoc-toc" class="toc-0-0-7"><script>
