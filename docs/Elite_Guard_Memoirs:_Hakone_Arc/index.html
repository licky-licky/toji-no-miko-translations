Suzuka onee-san! Good timing! Hey, do you two have any plans this weekend?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> What&#x27;s the rush? You came bursting in here without even knocking.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I wanna know if you two are busy this weekend!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> You can take a look at our schedules if you like. We don&#x27;t distinguish between weekdays and weekends.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Dang, what&#x27;s with this schedule? There isn&#x27;t a single break in here!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Unlike you, we need to do more than just suppressing aradama.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> And besides, aradama don&#x27;t take days off either.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> That&#x27;s right. On top of suppressing aradama, we need to conduct a prior investigation, confirm the results of the investigation, secure personnel to plan the operation, prepare the necessary equipment, as well as...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Okay, okay, I heard you the first time! You two are busy, I get it already!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Then I&#x27;ll change the question. What were you assigned this weekend?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> That&#x27;s unlike you. Why are you so interested in what we&#x27;re doing this weekend?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> C&#x27;mon, just tell me!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I think I had to lead an aradama cleanup operation in the southern part of the Izu peninsula. Isn&#x27;t that right, Suzuka?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> That&#x27;s right. As for me, I&#x27;ll be spending a day conducting an investigation throughout the entire northern Kanto region.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Reports of aradama infestations in the area have increased lately, so I will be searching for a connection.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Hm~. Okay... I got it!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Maki onee-san&#x27;s going to southern Izu, and Suzuka onee-san&#x27;s going to northern Kanto! I got it! Seeya!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> What&#x27;s gotten into Yume...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I know... She&#x27;s never been interested in our plans before.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> There&#x27;s never a dull moment with that girl.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Even if there&#x27;s hundreds of aradama, me and Nikkari Ao&#x27;e can handle it just fine. I don&#x27;t even need any investigations or planning.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Aradama cleanup in the southern Izu peninsula. For personal reasons, Tsubakuro Yume&#x27;s going at it alone-!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I did it! Let&#x27;s see~, next was Suzuka onee-san&#x27;s northern Kanto? That&#x27;s pretty far, but I&#x27;ll do my best!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> They&#x27;re gonna be so surprised!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ...What&#x27;s this?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> &quot;Postponement of the Aradama Cleanup Operation in the Southern Izu Peninsula&quot;...?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> &quot;This is a notice that the planned operation has hereby been postponed... The cleanup operation that was scheduled to begin at 2:00 has been postponed, as we can no longer confirm the existence of aradama in the area...&quot;<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> It seems your workload has been lightened, Maki-san. Isn&#x27;t that nice.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Mm, it&#x27;s a big help, but aradama don&#x27;t disappear on their own. I wonder what caused this.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ...Maybe I&#x27;ll have someone look into it.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="2-suspicious-yume"></a>2: Suspicious Yume<a class="hash-link" href="#2-suspicious-yume" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Maki:</strong> Hm...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> What&#x27;s that you&#x27;re reading?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Ahh, this is the detailed report on the aradama that disappeared earlier, isn&#x27;t it?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Yeah. Judging from the state of the area, there&#x27;s a high chance they were exterminated after a struggle with someone...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Exterminated... So this was the work of a toji then.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ...Seems like it.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Excuse me~!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Oh good, Maki onee-san, Suzuka onee-san. I was looking for you.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Yume.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Hey, hey, did you get some kind of report or message or anything!?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> A report?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Yeah, like about the aradama in southern Izu!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Ahh, one came in. It said they couldn&#x27;t confirm the existence of the aradama in the southern Izu peninsula, so the cleanup operation&#x27;s been postponed.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ah, so you heard already? Good~!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Already...? Did you know about this, Yume?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> N-No way, I didn&#x27;t know! I had no idea~! This is the first I&#x27;ve heard about it, I&#x27;m surprised-!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...I see.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Oh...? Yume, I can smell the distinct scent of freshly cut aradama coming off of you.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Eh!? That&#x27;s a smell?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> That&#x27;s weird, I took a bath right after I got home too... Sniff, sniff... Do I smell?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Oh my, and there&#x27;s a bit of noro stuck to your back!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh!? Where, where? Was it from when I beat those aradama!? Ughh, I can&#x27;t see back there...!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Yume... There&#x27;s no smell or noro.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Y-You tricked me, Suzuka onee-san!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Yume... Is there something you&#x27;re hiding from us?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> N-N-N-Nothing at all~! See you later-!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Suspicious, isn&#x27;t it...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> That goes beyond suspicious.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Phew~, that was a close one. They almost figured it out.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I need to keep this a tight secret until the mission&#x27;s complete. So everyone just thinks I&#x27;m on a normal vacation.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Alright, Maki onee-san&#x27;s weekend is taken care of! Now for Suzuka onee-san&#x27;s!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="3-situation-cleared"></a>3: Situation Cleared!<a class="hash-link" href="#3-situation-cleared" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Yume:</strong> Let&#x27;s see~, the next one was Suzuka onee-san&#x27;s in northern Kanto, wasn&#x27;t it. Northern Kanto, northern Kanto... Ah, here it is.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> &quot;April: Northern Kanto Aradama Investigation Plans. Investigation is to be carried out in the following four prefectures: Ibaraki, Tochigi, Gunma, Saitama...&quot;<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Huh... Was northern Kanto always this big? Wasn&#x27;t it just around the top of Tokyo!?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ah... Now that I look at it, the Tokyo area&#x27;s pretty big too...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Hinohara Village... Village...!? There&#x27;s a village in Tokyo too, huh...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be learning so much. I don&#x27;t really read this stuff most of the time...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I&#x27;ll have to look over them more from now on, to be more like Maki onee-san and Suzuka onee-san.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Hm~, Ibaraki, Tochigi, Gunma, and Saitama? Well, I&#x27;ll figure it out.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Okay-! I&#x27;ll go after Gunma first, then I&#x27;ll go clockwise through Tochigi, Ibaraki, and Saitama!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Let&#x27;s get to it~! ...Ah, oh yeah! This one could take a while, so I&#x27;ll bring chocolate bars and some tea with me.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Aradama cleanup in the whole area of northern Kanto. For personal reasons, Tsubakuro Yume&#x27;s going at it alone-!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> There! All aradama exterminated in the four areas of northern Kanto! The situation&#x27;s cleared!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> ...Wait, it&#x27;s not like I have to report this to anyone, since I&#x27;m doing it on my own.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Maki onee-san and Suzuka onee-san&#x27;s schedules should be freed up now. Next is Yukari-sama.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> If I can get Yukari-sama&#x27;s schedule cleared, Yomi onee-san shouldn&#x27;t be busy anymore either. Just 1/3rd to go, that&#x27;s all I have to do-!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Oh... &quot;April: Northern Kanto Aradama Investigation Requesting Postponement&quot;...?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> &quot;During an advance investigation of the area planned for April&#x27;s Northern Kanto aradama investigation, the spectrum finder could not detect any signs of aradama. As a result, I request that the investigation be temporarily postponed...&quot;<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> What a weird coincidence.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I know... How bizarre for both of our plans to have been cancelled at once like that.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Weird coincidences are sometimes inevitable... Though I think I&#x27;ll look into this.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Fufufu. But you already know who&#x27;s behind it, don&#x27;t you, Maki-san?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> What&#x27;s gotten into her this time... It&#x27;s unbelievable.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Is she trying to give us less work, or more? I can&#x27;t even tell.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="4-yumes-trying-her-best"></a>4: Yume&#x27;s Trying her Best<a class="hash-link" href="#4-yumes-trying-her-best" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Yume:</strong> Excuuuse me~! It&#x27;s Yume-!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> What is it, Yume-san?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Suzuka onee-san! Did you hear anything about that aradama investigation this weekend?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I did. Since they could no longer detect aradama in northern Kanto, the investigation has been delayed...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Mmhm, I see-!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> (Nice~, everything&#x27;s going great. I knew I could do it!)<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Yume... What are you trying to do?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Eh? What do you mean? I don&#x27;t get it-.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Sigh...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> You two just don&#x27;t have to worry about it! Ah, by the way, do you know what Yukari-sama&#x27;s schedule is like this weekend?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> She should have many things planned, but I&#x27;m afraid I don&#x27;t know the specifics.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> The exact hours might change as well, so you should ask Yukari-sama personally. Or maybe Yomi would know, since she&#x27;s generally at Yukari-sama&#x27;s side.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Hmmm, I guess I&#x27;ll have to ask Yukari-sama herself then...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> But anyway, if her hours are that confusing, isn&#x27;t Yukari-sama too busy? This is a real black company. She&#x27;s gonna work herself to death.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> As the head of the Origami family, she&#x27;s vital to all anti-aradama countermeasures. She&#x27;s busier than most politicians or CEOs would be.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Even more so, she&#x27;s kept up that lifestyle for over 20 years. You can&#x27;t help but respect her.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> (But I think she should take more breaks... Not just Yukari-sama, but Maki onee-san, Suzuka onee-san, and Yomi onee-san too.)<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Thanks, I got it-! I&#x27;ll ask Yukari-sama about her plans this weekend.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Oi, Yume! Don&#x27;t go bothering Yukari-sa--<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ...And she&#x27;s gone already.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> There&#x27;s no stopping her... I wonder what she thinks she&#x27;s up to.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Okay, time to finish this off with Yukari-sama!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> But, Suzuka onee-san said Yukari-sama had many things planned... &quot;Many&quot;.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Maybe getting all of them done is going to be really tough...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> No, it&#x27;ll be alright! Just like how I took care of those aradama all across northern Kanto in just one day!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> You can do it, you can do it! You can do it, Yume! You just have to try, so hang in there, don&#x27;t give up-!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Yeahhh~~~!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ...? Is that...?<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> What is it?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> It&#x27;s nothing... I only saw Tsubakuro-san outside the window... She seemed to be raising her fists and shouting.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Hm... Some sort of ritual? Or rather, could it be some new dance craze?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I haven&#x27;t heard of any craze like that...  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="5-maki-and-suzukas-investigation"></a>5: Maki and Suzuka&#x27;s Investigation<a class="hash-link" href="#5-maki-and-suzukas-investigation" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Maki:</strong> I still don&#x27;t know what Yume&#x27;s after, but if we keep ignoring her she&#x27;s going to cause trouble for Yukari-sama...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> It would certainly be a problem if it came to that.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Oh... Maki-san. I&#x27;ve just received a report on Yume&#x27;s activities.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Well?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> For the past few days, a member of the Special Sword Administration Bureau has been accompanying her and observed her suppressing aradama.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I figured. If Yume really was running off suppressing aradama, I didn&#x27;t think she&#x27;d be able to do it alone.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> She might have been able to fight by herself, but there&#x27;s no way she could travel such long distances without help, and she&#x27;d need people to collect the noro when she&#x27;s done too.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Right... According to the one who was with her, she first traveled to fight the aradama in the southern peninsula of Izu.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> The following day, it appears she began in the morning and spent many hours systematically suppressing the aradama in all four prefectures of northern Kanto.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> The Izu peninsula and northern Kanto...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> So like we thought, she&#x27;s been heading to the regions we were supposed to go and eliminating the aradama for us...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Really though, that girl always manages to surprise me. Ordinarily it would take dozens of toji to accomplish what she was able to do by herself.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> But what&#x27;s her goal...?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> She may have always loved to fight, but I&#x27;ve never seen her go so far out of her way to hunt aradama.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> She asked about our plans this weekend, so it must have to do with that.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...She may have been trying to clear up our schedules.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> In that case... I feel a little sorry for her.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> She might be at the top among the elite guard when it comes to skill, but she&#x27;s still a kid. And it hasn&#x27;t been long since she joined us...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> So I don&#x27;t think she really understands how &quot;missions&quot; work yet.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> That&#x27;s right. After all, we&#x27;ve already been assigned another mission in place of the ones that were postponed.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> And assuming she is trying to free up our schedules, that&#x27;s just impossible when it comes to Yukari-sama.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> On top of that... Why does she want us all available this weekend?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Surely she wants us all to play together with her.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> If that&#x27;s the case, she can do that whenever we have free time. But this is going to some pretty extreme lengths.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> So why is she suddenly doing it this weekend...?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Hmm, Yukari-sama and Yomi onee-san are both gone today, so I couldn&#x27;t ask them about their plans this weekend-. I&#x27;ll have to go ask tomorrow.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> And while I&#x27;ve got free time now, I can get everything ready! Good thinking, Yume!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I already bought the picnic blanket, so now I need enough food for 5 people.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I&#x27;ll get drinks for everyone too... Wait-!? What if Yukari-sama wants alcohol?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Should I get some alcohol too? But I can&#x27;t really picture her drinking it...  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="6-the-plan-falls-apart"></a>6: The Plan Falls Apart<a class="hash-link" href="#6-the-plan-falls-apart" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Yume:</strong> Yukari-sama~!

<strong>Yume:</strong> Aww, come on! I thought I&#x27;d get you today~.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> .........Tsubakuro-san. You&#x27;re abrupt as always.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Oh, Yomi onee-san, you&#x27;re here too. That&#x27;ll make this easy~!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Hey, Yukari-sama! Do you have any plans this weekend? You too, Yomi onee-san!<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Plans this weekend...? I&#x27;ll be discussing the budget with 14 government officials representing each ministry, as well as entering personnel negotiations with the National Police Agency.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Afterwards, I believe there were three research institutions that asked for my inspection. Isn&#x27;t that right, Yomi?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes. Konohana-san will be needed elsewhere, so this time I will be escorting you.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> There you have it. But why do you ask?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Tsubakuro-san, if you would like to know more... Please look over the schedule in detail on this tablet.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> ......What? This isn&#x27;t just Yukari-sama.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> There&#x27;s Maki onee-san, and Suzuka onee-san, and Yomi onee-san too... Everyone&#x27;s schedules are packed!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I thought Maki onee-san and Suzuka onee-san weren&#x27;t busy anymore?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> ...I mean, that&#x27;s what the reports I heard come in said!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Because they were available, they were given new assignments. As a matter of course.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> ...And what am I supposed to do about meeting with all those big government people!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I&#x27;m not gonna be able to help with that...!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Of course not.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Yume, you are very capable. But essentially, you are still only a student.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> To accompany me as my escort means joining me in consulting with members of the administration. You aren&#x27;t suited for it like Maki, Suzuka, or Yomi are.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Now then, Tsubakuro-san. What were you planning to do knowing Yukari-sama&#x27;s schedule?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Oh... Of course. So it wasn&#x27;t going to work from the start, huh.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Then just forget about it, Yukari-sama, and Yomi onee-san!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> It doesn&#x27;t matter anymore...!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="7-her-reason"></a>7: Her Reason<a class="hash-link" href="#7-her-reason" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Yume:</strong> It doesn&#x27;t matter anymore...!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Tsubakuro-san...?<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> She ran off.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Was something wrong...?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Excuse us.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> About our visit to Renpu Girls&#x27; School this weekend, we&#x27;ve compiled a summary of the points of our inspection we&#x27;d like you to review.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Here they are.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Hm, I see. I&#x27;ll look over it.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> On a side note... We passed Yume in the hall just now. She seemed awfully heartbroken about something... Did something happen?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I don&#x27;t fully understand it. She came to ask about Yukari-sama&#x27;s plans this weekend. After hearing she was busy, she suddenly began acting resentful.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I see... After all, when it comes to Yukari-sama...<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Do either of you know what that might have been about?<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Maki, Suzuka. This has something to do with the sudden shift in your assignments this weekend, doesn&#x27;t it?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> You noticed that...?<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> It&#x27;s my role as the leader of the Special Ritual Squad. I&#x27;m aware of all changes that affect you, regardless of how large or small.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> I&#x27;m also aware of Yume&#x27;s unauthorized efforts in clearing the aradama out of the southern Izu and northern Kanto areas.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Even while busy with your own duties, to be so mindful... I shouldn&#x27;t expect any less of you. In Yume&#x27;s case, she went to deal with those aradama after confirming Suzuka and my assignments this weekend.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> She was likely hoping that, by taking care of it in advance, our schedules would be cleared up this weekend.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> But I&#x27;m not sure why she wanted us available...<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> This is a list of the items Yume purchased at a store yesterday. It showed up on her expense report.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> A picnic blanket, bottled drinks... And she bought quite a lot of food.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Enough for a small party. Though, too much to take on a long trip or out hiking.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> And according to the forecast, it seems the cherry blossoms will be in full bloom this weekend.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Oh... I see. ...That&#x27;s what she&#x27;s after.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Ahh... When you think about it, it&#x27;s pretty simple.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...If that&#x27;s the case, I would like to reward Yume for her efforts...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> For suppressing the aradama in southern Izu and northern Kanto-- Yume may be extraordinarily skilled, but even for her it must have been difficult...<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> She must have been looking forward to it... Considering her history, this may have been the first time she could see the cherry blossoms in person...<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Hm... Very well then, Maki, Suzuka. I have new orders for you.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Adjust the entire schedule of the elite guard up until this weekend. Advance everything by one day.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> We&#x27;ll get to work on it.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Understood. Thank you.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Yomi, contact the related officials. Notify them the negotiations and discussions I planned to have this weekend will need to be accelerated.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Also, the three inspections will need to be cancelled. Tell them to submit a report of the necessary information pertaining to their circumstances according to their own judgment.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Understood.<br>
(This chapter was actually voiced live on a stream if you want to listen along)</p><div class="videoWrapper"><iframe width="640" height="480" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uAtUE2imzoU?t=1h24m34s"></iframe></div><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="8-dreams-come-true"></a>8: Dreams Come True<a class="hash-link" href="#8-dreams-come-true" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Yume:</strong> Ahhh...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> ...You don&#x27;t get to see this year&#x27;s cherry blossoms next year. And this was the perfect timing, since they&#x27;re in full bloom this weekend too...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I left everyone a message telling them to come at least... But I know they won&#x27;t make it.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> ...Even though I tried my best to see this with them...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> So that&#x27;s what you were up to after all.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> It&#x27;s true, it&#x27;s beautiful here.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> ...!! Maki onee-san, and Suzuka onee-san too!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Weren&#x27;t you busy with something else? I saw it. Your schedules were packed.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> We moved all our plans up so we could clear the whole day today. I&#x27;ve been losing sleep over it.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> But you can&#x27;t see this year&#x27;s cherry blossoms next year, after all.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> This is the only year you get to see them. Isn&#x27;t that right.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> .........<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> ...Eh!! Yukari-sama! And Yomi onee-san too!<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> I told the research institutions to make due with sending me a report. They&#x27;re only looking to win my favor, after all.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes, compared to this, those inspections would be a waste of time.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Whoa... Everyone&#x27;s here...! I wanted to see the cherry blossoms with all of you!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> But, acting on your own without permission, sortieing alone, is nothing to be proud of.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Yume, you&#x27;re the ace up our sleeve. But that means you have to actually be up our sleeve. If you go running off on your own, it&#x27;ll cause problems.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I understand...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> My, you&#x27;re being rather respectable today, Yume.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Well, everyone made it, so for today I feel like doing what I&#x27;m told!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> The &quot;for today&quot; part bothers me, but so long as you get it then that&#x27;s enough... And on that note.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Fourth seat of the elite guard, Tsubakuro Yume. For sortieing without permission twice, I will now announce your punishment.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> And since it&#x27;s twice, expect a strict punishment.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh~! ...Or that&#x27;s how I&#x27;d normally feel. But I don&#x27;t feel like getting upset about it today, so go ahead!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Then, Tsubakuro Yume. As punishment, you are hereby ordered to act as escort for Yukari-sama, as well as the three members of the elite guard; Shidou Maki, Konohana Suzuka, and Satsuki Yomi...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> In their inspection of the deciduous trees of the Rosaceae family, from the Amygdaloideae sub-family, in the Prunus genus, the Yoshino Cherry~!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> A fitting punishment, don&#x27;t you think, Yukari-sama?<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Fu... Indeed.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Such a strict punishment. I can hardly believe it.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Deciduous, rosaceae...? Huh...?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> You&#x27;re not the brightest, you know.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> You have to view the cherry blossoms with us, is what she means.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ohh, okay. Yeah... Yeah! I&#x27;ll be the best escort you&#x27;ve ever seen!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I&#x27;ll get rid of any aradama that show up before you know it! Count on it! I won&#x27;t let anyone get in your way!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> (I hope... That we can all see the cherry blossoms together again next year, just like this.)</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations/edit/docs/Elite_Guard_Memoirs:_Cherry_Blossom_Arc.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_2_ui" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_3DPF"></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"></div></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_35-E thin-scrollbar"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#1-what-yumes-up-to" class="table-of-contents__link">1: What Yume&#39;s Up To</a></li><li><a href="#2-suspicious-yume" class="table-of-contents__link">2: Suspicious Yume</a></li><li><a href="#3-situation-cleared" class="table-of-contents__link">3: Situation Cleared!</a></li><li><a href="#4-yumes-trying-her-best" class="table-of-contents__link">4: Yume&#39;s Trying her Best</a></li><li><a href="#5-maki-and-suzukas-investigation" class="table-of-contents__link">5: Maki and Suzuka&#39;s Investigation</a></li><li><a href="#6-the-plan-falls-apart" class="table-of-contents__link">6: The Plan Falls Apart</a></li><li><a href="#7-her-reason" class="table-of-contents__link">7: Her Reason</a></li><li><a href="#8-dreams-come-true" class="table-of-contents__link">8: Dreams Come True</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Links</div><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://pastebin.com/LdyviZ8Z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Translator anon&#x27;s pastebin<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Site source code<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Built with Docusaurus.</div></div></div></footer></div>
