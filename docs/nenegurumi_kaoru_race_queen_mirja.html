We'd very much like your help, Miss Kitora!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I'm not against helping you, but, sadly, I don't know much about motorcycles.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Why not ask someone more suited for this? Someone like Inago Akira should be up to the task.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Actually, we asked Boss, but she couldn't make it...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> You're the only one we can turn to, Mirja-san!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> And anyway, what we're missing is someone to help draw in visitors, so it's not like you even need to know about motorcycles!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ......<br><strong>All 3:</strong> Please help us!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ...Fine then.

Take a look, Mirja-san! This is it!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> To sum it up... I wear this, sit on the motorcycle, and attract people...<br><strong>Kihiro:</strong> As a staff member attracting visitors in the broadest sense, you're our billboard.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ...<br><strong>Keiko:</strong> I-I'm sorry... We were actually going to hire a professional to do this...<br><strong>Kihiro:</strong> You see, while building the motorcycle, my gen~ius instincts went and caught fire.<br><strong>Kihiro:</strong> And, while remodeling here and there, we completely spent through our budget.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> That's when I happened to hear about all this, and thought, why not ask Mirja-san?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> With your bombshell body, there's no way you wouldn't look great in it!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ...Unbelievable.<br><strong>Keiko:</strong> Um... Are you not going to do it afer all...?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> No, I will. I wouldn't turn you down after coming this far.

Our motorcycle is the center of attention!<br><strong>Kihiro:</strong> Now then! Let's hurry over and give our guests an explanation!<br><strong>Keiko:</strong> Right...!
