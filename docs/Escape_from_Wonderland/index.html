<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Quit shaking me... I&#x27;ve got expedition duty tomorrow... I&#x27;m sleeping in until the sun sets today...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Just wake up already!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> ......Where are we?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Good morning, Kaoru! Now everyone&#x27;s awake!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...Ahh, figures you were behind this. You know, Ellen, if you&#x27;re kidnapping someone, the prank&#x27;s gone too far.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> What led you to that conclusion!?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> I&#x27;m not the one who did this! When I woke up, I was just in this room too!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...Wait, what. Why&#x27;d something this annoying have to go and happen.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Did the rest of you wake up in here too?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah... I remember eating with Kiyoka and Fukki, and then...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I felt sleepy all of a sudden... When I woke up, I was here.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Yeah. Don&#x27;t remember anything else.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Something similar happened to me. What about you, Konohana Suzuka and Tsubakuro Yume?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Uhh...? Suzuka-onee-san, do you remember anything?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Not a single thing. We all seem to have been in different circumstances, but the common factor is that none of us remember how we got here.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Somebody&#x27;s going around kidnapping toji? I bet our presid-- our old hag finally made someone snap.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> You&#x27;re taking this situation in stride. Do you have experience in being kidnapped?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Who would...? What I&#x27;m thinking is, there&#x27;s two of the elite guard here.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> So they must be searching for us like crazy right about now.<br>
<strong>???:</strong> Oh no! Oh no! At this rate, Wonderland will be gone for good!<br>
<strong>???:</strong> ...But, wait? Why was it going away again?<br>
<strong>???:</strong> Oh no! Oh no!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> That voice, that&#x27;s Chii-nee!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Chie&#x27;s here... Forget searching for us, I guess we&#x27;re already safe. Does that mean we can just go back to sleep now?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> We have our duties as the elite guard to consider, so I&#x27;d like to make my way out.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> And besides... Given the situation, it might be amusing to play along.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> We want to get out of here fast too. We were about to go see a movie!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Then, we&#x27;re going to have to figure out how to leave this place!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> The only way out of the room is through this locked door. There has to be a key around here somewhere.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I don&#x27;t see any key, however... There is a photograph on the table.<br>
<strong>[Q0]:</strong> (There is a photo of Kaoru, Mihono, Kiyoka, Kofuki, Yume, Ellen, Mirja, and Suzuka...)<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> On the backside there is the letter &quot;Q&quot;... Does it mean &quot;Question&quot;?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Are they saying we have to answer the question if we want to leave the room?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Oh! It&#x27;s an escape room game!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> The answer&#x27;s easy peasy! It&#x27;s eight people!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ehhh, why was that wrong? Wasn&#x27;t the question how many people were in the picture?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yume, we mustn&#x27;t jump to conclusions. You should think a little longer about the question before answering next time.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Hmmm... They&#x27;re really making this difficult, not writing out the question.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> This is only my assumption, but it&#x27;s likely the answer would be too easily discovered if the full question were written out.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Which means the answer&#x27;s easy. This&#x27;ll be fun; let&#x27;s see Mihocchi give it a shot.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Me!? Umm, umm... I-Is it one of those ones where you spot the differences?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Like we compare the picture to how things are in the room now, and see if anything&#x27;s different... Or something.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Oh, that&#x27;s a way better idea than I was expecting. So, what&#x27;s different?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Hmm, it all looks the same to me...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> These things usually have more than one difference, and they just keep getting harder, right?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> So I think there should be one or two easy ones... Is the answer that the desk is bigger?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> That seems to have been wrong?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> That&#x27;s weird... They gave us a photo, so I was sure they were asking what was different...<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Maybe that&#x27;s a trap?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> If Chichie made this, then we&#x27;ve gotta see through her tricks.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> This is exciting; it feels like we&#x27;re getting closer to figuring it out!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> See through... What if it&#x27;s that we&#x27;re all awake, or that there&#x27;s no photo on the table?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> There&#x27;s two answers that sound good enough, Mihocchi.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Going by my intuition... The answer is, we&#x27;re not asleep now!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> KYAA!?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Why&#x27;d the lights go out... Hey!? Mirja&#x27;s not here anymore!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Huh...? This is, Mirja&#x27;s glasses, and a watch...?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Don&#x27;t tell me... Because we got it wrong, Mirja-san got turned into glasses!?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Sigh... Don&#x27;t be ridiculous. It seems that, after a certain number of mistakes, one of us is eliminated.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> In that case, the time left on here is our time limit? 100 minutes... Feels like we could use it all on this question.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Don&#x27;t worry. If this is an escape room game, there&#x27;s sure to be some kind of hint in the room.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Did anyone see a hint anywhere?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> No, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Really?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Come up with something more than &quot;Really&quot;!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> There&#x27;s aradama!?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Least they brought something to keep us from getting bored in here! I&#x27;ll take care of all of them!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> No fair, Onee-san! Let me have some too-!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> A playing card fell out of it... Oh? Something&#x27;s written on it.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> There it is!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Seems like the aradama must have taken our hint.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> The spectrum finder is still getting a reading... This won&#x27;t be settled so easily.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Let&#x27;s gather all the hints we can.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Aha, this is more fun than regular aradama fighting~.<br>
<strong>Hint 1:</strong> &quot;Don&#x27;t let them get in the way of our rampage!&quot;<br>
<strong>Hint 2:</strong> &quot;If only they weren&#x27;t around!&quot;<br>
<strong>Hint 3:</strong> &quot;Our natural enemy!&quot;  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="2-the-eight-white-rabbits-room"></a>2: The Eight White Rabbits Room<a class="hash-link" href="#2-the-eight-white-rabbits-room" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Ellen:</strong> I get it now. The answer is... &quot;Toji&quot;!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ah, a key fell down!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Now we can move on to the next room! Let&#x27;s go see what the next question is!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> This room... It looks just like the last one, doesn&#x27;t it? Maybe there&#x27;s another photo lying around?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I don&#x27;t think they would use the same question twice in a row...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Onee-sans, there&#x27;s two letters on top of the table.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> The first one has the question, and the second... What is this?<br>
<strong>Letter from the White Rabbit:</strong> Help us, Miss Toji! Defeat the aradama, and protect Wonderland!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Aradama have appeared in Wonderland, and they&#x27;ve brought toji in to help... I suppose that&#x27;s the story here.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> What does the question say?<br>
<strong>[Q1]:</strong> Two Dumptys, Five Tweedle Dums and Tweedle Dees, and six Humptys chased the eight White Rabbits.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> &quot;Two Dumptys, Five Tweedle Dums and Tweedle Dees, and six Humptys chased the eight White Rabbits&quot;...?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Why are Humpty and Dumpty written separately...?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Did you figure something out, Suzuka-onee-san?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> No... It&#x27;s only that, Humpty Dumpty is one character.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Humpty and Dumpty shouldn&#x27;t be treated as two separate things...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> And there&#x27;s way too many people too!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> There weren&#x27;t eight white rabbits, or anywhere near that many Tweedle Dees and Dums!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Without the question written out, I&#x27;m at a loss... I don&#x27;t know what kind of answer they want.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...There aren&#x27;t any hints in this room either, are there.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Does that mean there&#x27;s gonna be more aradama-chan coming in here? This is the best!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Alright, Mihocchi! I&#x27;ll get the clues for you, so you&#x27;re in charge of solving the question!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Eh-!? You have to solve it with me, Fukki-!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> We&#x27;ve gotta split up the work. Since you didn&#x27;t help at all with the last question, you&#x27;ve gotta try extra hard with this one.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I-I&#x27;ll try!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Uhh... There&#x27;s eight white rabbits, right? So, maybe the Humpty Dumpties made... body... doubles?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> What, like Humpty Dumpty&#x27;s a ninja? You want to go with that answer?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Y-Yeah. Ah, we can make up to two mistakes, right?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> We knew that was wrong before she even said it! Why didn&#x27;t you stop her, Suzuka-onee-san?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> There&#x27;s hardly a reason to get angry over one or two mistakes. So long as the final answer is correct.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> You should think up with an answer with us, Yume.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I&#x27;m helping with beating the aradama, so you can answer the quiz questions, Suzuka-onee-san!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Don&#x27;t be like that, Yumecchi. I bet it&#x27;ll be a lot of fun to figure it out for yourself!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Then at least give me a hint. It&#x27;s too hard; I don&#x27;t really get it.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Hmm, this is a tough one. We need something to set us on the right path.<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> GUOOOOOOO!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Yumecchi, there&#x27;s aradama!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Did they come to give us a hint!? HAAAAAAA!!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Ah, wait up, Yume... Hey, there&#x27;s none of them left for me!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> That&#x27;s your fault for being a slowpoke, Onee-san.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Huhh!? Who&#x27;re you calling a slowpoke!?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> And the hint... I see, so that&#x27;s what they want.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Oh, this tells us how to answer it! With this, we just have to...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Kiyokaaa... Even with the hint, I don&#x27;t get ittt...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> You need to focus more on your studies, Asakura-san.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Uuu...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Hang in there, Mihomiho!<br>
<strong>Hint 1:</strong> There is a hidden word.<br>
<strong>Hint 2:</strong> whiterabbit<br>

<strong>Ellen:</strong> [White rabbit] is &quot;White Rabbit&quot;! And there were eight of them, so we pick out the eighth letter: &quot;b&quot;!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> If we keep picking out letters of the alphabet like that, then line them up in order, we get... Buddy!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> What is it, Yume? You&#x27;re pouting like something&#x27;s the matter.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I thought this was boring, but I&#x27;m sorta frustrated that I couldn&#x27;t figure it out...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I&#x27;ll be the one to answer the next question, okay!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> In this room too, they left two letters for us. Let&#x27;s see...<br>
<strong>Letter from the White Rabbit:</strong> Ahh!? My treasures were scattered all about!!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Treasures...? Is the question this time about finding treasures?<br>
<strong>[Q2]:</strong> MITSU TSUGU tsu ha SUI YASU no JIN ZEN GIRI ru no ya ECHI KANE ki<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Umm, &quot;mitsu tsugu tsu&quot;...?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Let me have it, Onee-san! ...The heck is this!?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I want to see too, Tsubakuro-san! ...Whoa, my head hurts.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> There&#x27;s supposed to be treasures hidden in here, right? Treasures... Treasures...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> There aren&#x27;t any treasures anywhere!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Hang on, Tsubakuro-san! At times like these, you&#x27;re supposed to go with &quot;tanuki&quot;, right!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Are you being serious, Onee-san? There&#x27;s not even a picture of a tanuki anywhere, and there isn&#x27;t even a &quot;ta&quot; to start with.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah... Uhh, th-then, let&#x27;s just take out all the capitalized letters to start!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh, should we really mess around with it that much?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> That&#x27;s one way of thinking about it. If we take out all the uppercase... Tsu ha no ru no ya ki?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Tsuha no Runoyaki? If you read it backwards... Kiya no Runohatsu?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Is that a treasure?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Maybe it could be...?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> It isn&#x27;t going to be so sim... Hm? Hang on...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ahhh! Wait, stop, Suzuka-onee-san! I&#x27;ll come up with the answer, so you don&#x27;t say anything!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...Very well then.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Let&#x27;s solve it together, Tsubakuro-san!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Why? I&#x27;ll be the one to solve it, so you can just sit down, Onee-san.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Don&#x27;t be like that; won&#x27;t it be more fun to figure it out together?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> I&#x27;ve been waiting for this, aradama-chan!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Tsubakuro-san! We should fight the aradama too, so we can get a hint!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I can solve it on my own. Suzuka-onee-san didn&#x27;t need a hint, so I don&#x27;t either.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Hono-chan, there&#x27;s the hint! The hint for this question is...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Don&#x27;t read it out loud, Kiyoka! I&#x27;m still thinking!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Tsuha no runoyaki, tsuha noru no yaki...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Oh, I got it!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ahh!? Tsubakuro-san, don&#x27;t say it!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh, but if we had to wait on you, Onee-san, the time would run out.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> If it comes down to this... Kiyoka! Show me the hint!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Here you go, Hono-chan.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Okay, okay... Mm? Wait, I already know there&#x27;s treasures, but...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> In that case, how about this hint?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Umm... Ah! So that&#x27;s how it is! To get the answer, we just have to do this, right?<br>

<strong>Hint 2:</strong> Toji come with what?<br>

<strong>Ellen:</strong> Sohayanotsuruki is Chie&#x27;s, Suijingiri Kanemitsu is Yomiyomi&#x27;s, and Echizen Yasutsugu is my okatana!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Is there some reason why it&#x27;s those three?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> I wonder about that...? It is interesting, but for now, let&#x27;s move on forward!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> So, in this room we&#x27;ve got another two letters... And next to them, some cakes.<br>
<strong>Letter from the White Rabbit:</strong> Only a little bit further to the boss! But before that, take a quick break!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Does that mean we can eat these cakes?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Nice-! Which one should I have?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I want this shortcake here. I&#x27;m gonna try it-!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Stop right there.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I don&#x27;t believe they&#x27;d leave us these cakes without some deeper reason.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> You&#x27;re overthinking it. They told us we could eat them, so what&#x27;s wrong with it?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> They did not say we could eat them. Mashiko-san, what is the question this time?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> It&#x27;s right here.<br>
<strong>[Q3]:</strong> A: eaiohinebtehexo B: tlewtohaercherm C: ascfasttloatnto<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> &quot;Eaiohinebtehexo&quot;...<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> &quot;Tlewtohaercherm&quot;...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> &quot;Ascfasttloatnto&quot;?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> I don&#x27;t get it. Must be because I don&#x27;t have enough sugar in my system. Maybe we ought to eat some cake after all.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> I know! I&#x27;ve got a good idea! Let&#x27;s make it a competition!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> A competition?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Yes! The first person to solve the question gets to eat the cakes!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I don&#x27;t see anything wrong with that. If we don&#x27;t put some restriction on it, someone may eat the cake out from under us.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> ...We just have to solve the question first? Then, I&#x27;m gonna figure it out before anybody else!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Kiyoka, let&#x27;s figure it out together! Then we can split the cakes!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Okay! I&#x27;ll do my best, Hono-chan!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> You okay with this, Ellen? These cakes are the ones from that bakery you love so much, aren&#x27;t they?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Of course I am! Rather than eating them normally, eating them after I&#x27;ve won them is going to make them taste that much better!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Now then, what connection is there between A, B, and C... Reading them in reverse... It doesn&#x27;t seem to mean anything.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> WAAH-! Don&#x27;t do that, Suzuka-onee-san! If you try hard to solve it, you&#x27;ll figure it out right away!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> That&#x27;s the nature of the competition. I&#x27;m not about to hold back on you, you know.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Suzuka-onee-san&#x27;s getting serious!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Though, in spite of that... However I look at it, I can&#x27;t find the answer.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> From the way that it&#x27;s listed out, there must be some way to read it...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Hmmm, I&#x27;m not sure how though...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Judging from the previous rooms, there should be something simple we aren&#x27;t getting that will make it solvable...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Something simple...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Ah! Eavesdropping is off limits, Hanahana!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Come now, don&#x27;t put it so harshly. You said it loud enough for me to overhear.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> The alphabet... Removing any repeated letters... Hmm, they all seem to be wrong.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> It&#x27;s aradama-chan time!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I&#x27;m going to get the hints!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Kiyoka, we have to try too!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Right!<br>
<strong>Everyone:</strong> HAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Umm... What is this? This hint&#x27;s no good!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Onee-san, give me your hint!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Ahh, sure. Here.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Thanks! ...Wait, what are you supposed to do with this!?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ahhhhh, Fukki, how could you... Kiyoka, what about your hint!?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Don&#x27;t worry, Hono-chan! This should be enough!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ahh, you onee-sans can already solve it!? Suzuka-onee-san!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Oh my, are you coming to me for help?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> If they&#x27;re going to split the cakes in half, we can do that too!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> What am I ever going to do with you. Then, let&#x27;s not waste time... Ahh, so that&#x27;s how it is.<br>
<strong>Hint 1:</strong> From the start.<br>
<strong>Hint 2:</strong> In order.<br>
<strong>Hint 3:</strong> A&gt;C&gt;B<br>
<strong>Hint 4:</strong> Vertically.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="5-the-traitor-room"></a>5: The Traitor Room<a class="hash-link" href="#5-the-traitor-room" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yume, you may eat a piece of whichever cake you like.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Huh? But we still haven&#x27;t solved it yet!?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Konohana-san&#x27;s cheating!?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> You do speak so poorly of me. But eating a piece of cake is the solution.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Huh? Why&#x27;s that the right answer?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> That&#x27;s how it was written. If you try reading them all at once, top down from A to C to B, you&#x27;ll understand.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> &quot;Eat a slice of what is on the table to reach the next room&quot;...<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Kaoru: If somebody&#x27;d just snuck in a bite, we would have solved this easy.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah, that&#x27;s true...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> B-But, in that case, we wouldn&#x27;t have realized we solved it...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Now then, let&#x27;s move on to the next room. If the other letter was correct... The next may be the final room.<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> BUUUOOOOOOOO!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> The boss is an aradama!?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> There&#x27;s no way they&#x27;d leave aradama here as the boss!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Kohagura-san is right. Before we can solve that mystery, we&#x27;ll have to defeat these aradama!!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> The spectrum finder isn&#x27;t reading anything anymore.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> What, is that all of them?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> They were way too weak! I didn&#x27;t get to have any fun at all.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> And anyway, they didn&#x27;t give us a hint card either; we got a letter instead.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="r-there-is-a-traitor-among-you-listen-to-the-white-rabbit-to-find-who-can-stop-them"></a>[R]: There is a traitor among you.

<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> One of us in here is a traitor...?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> W-Well it&#x27;s not me!?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> You sure about that? Chichie&#x27;s the one setting this up, right? I&#x27;m thinking that makes Mihocchi the number one suspect.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Kofuki-san, your smile&#x27;s giving it away.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Ah, seriously!?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Huh? Wh-What do you mean, Kiyoka!?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It means she never actually thought you were the traitor.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> After all, there&#x27;s no way Hono-chan could keep up an act for that long, is there?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Th-That&#x27;s true! Thank goodness...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Then the traitor&#x27;s gotta be Suzuka-onee-san, right? Suzuka-onee-san&#x27;s a good actor, isn&#x27;t she?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> True, I think I could manage it. However, I am not the traitor.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Are you lying...?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I am not! More importantly, &quot;find who can stop them&quot;... That part interests me.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ah, she changed the subject! That&#x27;s fishy...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Come to think of it... Konohana-san&#x27;s been leading the way when it comes to solving the questions, hasn&#x27;t she?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> That sort of doesn&#x27;t seem like something she&#x27;d do...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> You&#x27;re right... Now that you mention it, maybe Hanahana&#x27;s acting strange... I think...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> That&#x27;s because, with myself and Yume here, I decided this incident was affecting Yukari-sama!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Bringing up Yukari-sama now sounds even more fishy...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...It seems nothing I can say would help at this point. I&#x27;ll only say this.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I am not the traitor.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Hmph. You can say whatever you want... Cause beating you is gonna solve this faster.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> That&#x27;s the trouble with you... You should think things through more before you act, Yume.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> You&#x27;re being too aggressive! This is just a game, okay? There&#x27;s no need to get violent!<br>
<strong>Suzuka/Yume:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Come on, are you listening to me!?<br>
Throughout the story so far, there are hints to the traitor&#x27;s identity.</p><p><strong>Hint 1:</strong> Combine all the answers, and what do you get?  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="6-escape"></a>6: Escape!<a class="hash-link" href="#6-escape" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Oi, Yume. Suzuka&#x27;s not the traitor.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Isn&#x27;t that right, Ellen.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> ...Huh? What are you talking about?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh-? It&#x27;s not Suzuka-onee-san?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> You&#x27;re the traitor, aren&#x27;t you. Ellen.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Umm... Isn&#x27;t Ellen-san the one who can stop the traitor...?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> By &quot;listen to the white rabbit&quot;, it means the person who all the answers pointed to so far, right?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> See, look, the last question&#x27;s the only one that&#x27;s different.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> There wasn&#x27;t the usual letter from the white rabbit, and the letter on the question is &quot;R&quot; instead of &quot;Q&quot;.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah! You&#x27;re right... Since we&#x27;re still in the escape room game, this is another part of the riddle, isn&#x27;t it!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> That&#x27;s how it goes. Which means... The white rabbit didn&#x27;t write the last question. It&#x27;s a fake.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Huh? Then, who did write it?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> The traitor, of course.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> The question wasn&#x27;t about finding who could stop the traitor, it was about discovering who the traitor is.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...I should have been able to see through such a simple trick, if only I were thinking more clearly.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> If the traitor is the one who wrote it... Then that makes whoever the questions indicated the most suspicious.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Which means, she is a toji, a &quot;buddy&quot;, owns one of the three okatana, her favorite cakes were in the room...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> It does all point to Kohagura-san.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> It&#x27;s not like you could help it when the fingers were pointing at you.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> ...Uu, I&#x27;m sorry, Suzuka-onee-san.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I can&#x27;t blame you, in these circumstances.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> So, how&#x27;d I do?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Bingo bingo-! You&#x27;re right on the money! The final question of the escape room game has been cleared!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> That&#x27;s my Kaoru! You stole the show right at the end!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Nah, I knew halfway through that you were working with whoever&#x27;s running this.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Eh!? Since when!?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Even though you got dragged into an escape room game, you were acting way less excited than you should have been.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> So, I thought that was suspicious... But I wasn&#x27;t sure until we got to the cakes.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Under normal circumstances, you would&#x27;ve eaten them right away.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> I don&#x27;t think I like how confident you are about that.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> But I&#x27;m not wrong, right?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> And you only offered to do a competition because you already knew the answer. Right?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> ...I really am no match for you, Kaoru.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Now then... Here, the last key! Kaoru, please open the door.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> I didn&#x27;t think we could&#x27;ve been moved very far... But we&#x27;re right here!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Great work, all of you!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah, Mirja-san! You were helping run this too?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Yes. Originally, I was meant to reach the third mistake early on and retire.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> However... We didn&#x27;t imagine that, before I could do that, you would reach three mistakes, Asakura Mihono...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Asakura Mihono, you need to have a greater sense of caution before you act.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> A-Ahaha...<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> What, you were here too? Which means, you actually supplied the aradama?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> No, that was a random occurrence. We wouldn&#x27;t leave out aradama for an escape room game.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> So, what was this all for anyway?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Actually, some toji have been brainstorming ideas for attractions to liven up the area... This was a beta test for that.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Just so you know, you can hire testers for those.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> About that... Under normal circumstances, the hints were meant to be hidden in places where you can find them, but...<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> For some reason, right before the test, aradama seem to have made off with them.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> At that point... Ellen-san came up with a plan to get you all to help.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> So it was your fault after all!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> But it was fun, wasn&#x27;t it? We have to thank Yukari-sama for allowing Hanahana and Yumecchi to join in too!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> So you did get Yukari-sama&#x27;s approval.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Well, it wasn&#x27;t that bad of a way to spend some time.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> (Yukari-sama approved of this... She&#x27;s actually pretty free spirited, isn&#x27;t she?)<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah, the movie! Kiyoka, Fukki, if we leave now, we can still make it! Let&#x27;s go!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Oh yeah, we were gonna do that.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Ah, hang on! Here, free vouchers for the cafeteria. It&#x27;s your prize for clearing within the time limit.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Thank you very much. If there&#x27;s anything else we can do to help, let us know.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Of course, you&#x27;re a big help.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Now then, Yume and I must return to our duties as the elite guard.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Please put on the best escape room game you can.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Seeya later! It was pretty fun.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Alright, the rest of us here are going to hold a strategy meeting on what to improve for the opening!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> The rest of us here... Wait, I&#x27;m here!?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> No complaining; come help us, Kaoru!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Let&#x27;s re-examine the beta test so we can produce an entertaining escape room game.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Ah, then, can we intentionally place aradama in there now? The types we can use are limited, but it&#x27;s proven to work.<br>
<strong>Everyone:</strong> Out of the question!</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations/edit/docs/Escape_from_Wonderland.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_2_ui" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_3DPF"></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"></div></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_35-E thin-scrollbar"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#1-the-photo-room" class="table-of-contents__link">1: The Photo Room</a></li><li><a href="#2-the-eight-white-rabbits-room" class="table-of-contents__link">2: The Eight White Rabbits Room</a></li><li><a href="#3-the-treasure-room" class="table-of-contents__link">3: The Treasure Room</a></li><li><a href="#4-the-break-room" class="table-of-contents__link">4: The Break Room</a></li><li><a href="#5-the-traitor-room" class="table-of-contents__link">5: The Traitor Room</a></li><li><a href="#r-there-is-a-traitor-among-you-listen-to-the-white-rabbit-to-find-who-can-stop-them" class="table-of-contents__link">R: There is a traitor among you.
