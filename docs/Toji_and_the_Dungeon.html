Whenever I'm training, that's always on my mind.</p><p>Still, what should I be doing besides swinging my okatana? What should I be doing besides polishing what I already know? Is there something else, something I'm missing?</p><p>Again and again, I can't get it out of my mind. But I still haven't found the answer...</p><p><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Jeez. They said there's a huge outbreak of aradama in these hills, but the spectrum finder hasn't picked up anything since we got here. Yoo, Hiyori, how's your thing doing?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Nn? Ahh... My spectrum meter hasn't reacted either.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Hmm, this is strange. The report said they were right around here.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> You think maybe, they ran away...?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> But, the STT officers have the area surrounded. If they saw something, surely they'd call us about it...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Hey, why don't we just head back to the command post and check? We're only wasting our time walking in circles out here.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...You're right. That's probably for the best.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Okay. You lead the way, Kiyoka.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Alright. Umm, if I remember right, the command post was this way... ...Huh? What's that sound?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Uhh, beats me? Actually, can you feel the ground shaking?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> You two, watch where you're standing! The ground's collapsing!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Eh...? Wah, kyaaaaaaa-!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Kiyoka...! Ah, I'm falling tooooooo!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Whoahh, it's even happening over here!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Ahh, I can't escape!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Kh... If I use jin'i...!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> N-No use... My balance...!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ..................ugh...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Oh, Hiyori's awake.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Juujou-san, are you okay!? Did you get hurt anywhere!?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Ahh, I'm fine... But, where are we...?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> We're in some kind of cave system.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> But, it's weird... The ground under our feet collapsed, yet...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> There's no hole in the ceiling...!?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> That's not all that's weird. Take a look around the cave. Isn't it strangely bright in here?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Now that you mention it... Those crystals have some kind of glow to them. What do you think they are...?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> We can't get through to call for rescue, and it's anyone's guess which way we should go to get out... Aghh, why does this have to happen to me.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Huh? Any of you guys hear that?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That sound... It sounds like someone's fighting!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Nnn? Aren't we supposed to be the only toji out here?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Then maybe that's our rescue.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Whoever they are, we can't ignore them. Let's go, everyone.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> They're close! Right up ahead!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I think I see them...! Wait, huhhh!?<br><strong>???:</strong> Hmph...!<br><strong>???:</strong> Unleashed streak of light, bow limbs of the holy tree. You are an expert of the bow. Shoot, sniper of the fairies. Penetrate, arrow of absolute accuracy...<br><strong>???:</strong> Arcs Ray!<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> GUAAAAAA...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> W-W-W-Wh-What the hell!?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> There's a beautiful girl in armor, and an elf, and magic!!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Magic...!? That's not real though...!?<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> GUAAAAAA!<br><strong>???:</strong> Ais-san, there's more of them!<br><strong>Ais:</strong> Get back, Lefiya... I'll get rid of these monsters...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Look out! They're getting surrounded!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> If we use jin'i, we can get there in time! All of us should be able to force the aradama back!  </p><h2 id="2-an-echoing-scream-in-another-world" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>2: An Echoing Scream in Another World</h2><p><strong>Ais:</strong> Tempest!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> (What... That girl, wind came and surrounded her body...!)<br><strong>Ais:</strong> ...!<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> GUOOOOOO...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> That's amazing! The rest of the aradama were beaten in no time!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Yeah... I can't believe what I'm seeing. She used the wind to cut them up.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> It's actual real magic power!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Seems like they didn't need our help after all...<br><strong>Ais:</strong> Phew...<br><strong>Lefiya:</strong> That was fantastic, Ais-sama! Nicely done!<br><strong>Ais:</strong> Nn, you too, Lefiya... And the rest of you too...<br><strong>Lefiya:</strong> Thank you for your assistance. And, those weapons... Did you come from the far east, by any chance?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Far... East...?<br><strong>Ais:</strong> ...?<br><strong>Lefiya:</strong> Eh? Am I wrong?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Ah, uhh, that's right. We're from the far east alright, you can't mistake it.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Oi, Kaoru...!?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Just play along for now. I've got no clue what's going on, but if we cause some misunderstanding these two could be big trouble for us, okay?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Well, you have a point...<br><strong>Lefiya:</strong> We received a request from the guild, to investigate those monsters we were fighting just now... What brings all of you here?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Right. We got a request from the guild too, to investigate the a... The monsters, you know.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Yeah, yeah. But, while we were investigating, we got lost. I hate to ask, but could you help show us the way back out?<br><strong>Lefiya:</strong> Adventurers like yourselves got lost this close to the entrance...?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I know, right! But all of us have a terrible sense of direction!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Wow...! They just keep lying their way through everything...!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Shhh. Don't say that so loud, Hono-chan.<br><strong>Lefiya:</strong> A bad sense of direction...? Hmm... Ais-san, what should we do?<br><strong>Ais:</strong> Nn, we should head up too... We've finished our investigation, after all...<br><strong>Lefiya:</strong> That's true. Very well then, everyone. It's this way. We can exit together.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Ah... Thanks, and sorry to bother you.<br><strong>Lefiya:</strong> It's no bother, Ais-sa--<br><strong>Lefiya:</strong> --You're not Ais-sama!? I'm so sorry, I mistook you for her!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...How?<br><strong>Lefiya:</strong> We're going to make our report to the guild now, but what will you all do?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> We were supposed to meet somewhere else first, so we'll stop by the guild later.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> That's right!<br><strong>Lefiya:</strong> I see. Then, we'll be parting here. Let's go, Ais-san.<br><strong>Ais:</strong> Nn...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...Are they gone?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> All clear.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Then there's no point holding it in anymore...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> What the hell's going on around hereeee!? Where the hell are we anywayyyyy!?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I'm about to have a panic attack! Actually, I'm pretty sure I've been having one this whole time!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Wawa, calm down, you two! Though it's not like I can calm down either!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Elves, magic, guilds, monsters, adventurers... And the outside world looks like this... I think, maybe, we...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Did you figure something out, Kiyoka?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Umm... Normally you wouldn't expect something like this to happen, but I read about it in novels a lot... We might have been sent to a parallel world...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Parallel world...?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Oi oi, seriously...?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> But, why? Weren't we just on a hillside?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Well... When that hole opened under us, it might have been a link to another world, I think...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Then, how are we supposed to get back to our world?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Um... I don't know that much, exactly...<br><strong>???:</strong> Wawawa, what're you doing? Come on, let go of me!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Nn? What's going on?<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> GUAAAAAA!<br><strong>???:</strong> Hyaaaa! I'm under attackkkk!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Oh no! Those aradama are dragging that girl into the tower!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Wait, isn't that were we just came from!?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Let's get after them! We have to save her before we lose sight of them!  </p><h2 id="3-goddess-hestia" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>3: Goddess Hestia</h2><p><strong>???:</strong> Oh boy, you girls saved me. I never expected to get attacked by monsters while I was working this part time job.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> As long as you're safe. By the way, who are you...?<br><strong>???:</strong> I haven't introduced myself yet, have I? I'm Hestia. As you can see, I'm a goddess!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> A... Goddess...?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Err, you're working a part time job even though you're a goddess?<br><strong>Hestia:</strong> Uuu... There's a really good reason for that. But it'd take a while to explain, so you'll just have to trust me.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Oi, Kiyoka. Is she really a goddess? I mean, normally speaking, she does have a pretty ridiculous body type.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I-I don't think her body matters... But this is a parallel world, so anything could be possible.<br><strong>Hestia:</strong> Hmm? What're you whispering about? And, now that I look closer, I've never seen anyone like you before...<br><strong>Hestia:</strong> ...Oh, I think I get it. Hmmhmm. I see, that's how it is.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Nn? That's how it is, what's how it is?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> D-Don't look at me...?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> By the way, Hestia. Could you tell us about what's been going on in this town? We're, um, ahh, how should I put it...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> We just came back from a long journey, so we aren't up to date on how things have been going.<br><strong>Hestia:</strong> Hmm, a long journey, huh? Okay. Well I'll go with that explanation for now.<br><strong>Hestia:</strong> In that case, you girls must be surprised too, right? These past few days, this town's lost a lot of its liveliness.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Lost its liveliness...?<br><strong>Hestia:</strong> Well you know, this town is made up of merchants and the adventurers who get compensated by them to defeat the monsters in the dungeon, right?<br><strong>Hestia:</strong> But a few days ago, those weird monsters from before are the only thing people can find in the dungeon.<br><strong>Hestia:</strong> Even when you beat them, they don't drop any items that can be turned in for money at the guild. So now the adventurers have had their supply of income cut off.<br><strong>Hestia:</strong> Thanks to them, it's a mad dash for any part time jobs people can grab around town. Even my darling Bell-kun is out working against his will, far away from home...<br><strong>Hestia:</strong> Awww... Bell-kun, come back and see me soon...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Sounds like the aradama are putting the people here through a really hard time.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> I guess that's why the two we met in the dungeon before were investigating them.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah, then maybe...!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Did you figure something out, Kiyoka?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Yes. I think we might have been brought here to eliminate those aradama. So, once we clear them all out...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I get it! Then we can go back to our world!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah, but... Before we get sent back home, I kinda want to see for myself what they have around this world...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Even if it's just once, I want to use magic.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Oh! Good idea! Don't you think so, Hiyoyon?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> I... Both the okatana and training my mother left me are all that I need...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Look at you, acting all serious. You know you can tell us you're way more into it than anyone, right? I saw the way your eyes were glued to them when they were casting magic back there.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Th-That was...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Um, Hestia-sama? How would we go about using magic? None of us know how to...<br><strong>Hestia:</strong> Hmm, magic, huh. There's a technique to it, but... Nn?<br><strong>Hestia:</strong> Hello there? Who's feeling up my butt?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Butt? It isn't one of us.<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> KISHAAAAAA-!<br><strong>Hestia:</strong> Wawawa, there's another more! Hey, let go! Uhyaaa, I'm being kidnappedddddd! Outsiders, h-h-help meeeee!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ahh!? She got carried into the dungeon again!?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Besides that, she called us "outsiders" just now...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> They just keep going straight for that goddess, don't they?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Aradama were enshrined as gods in the past, so maybe they think she's one of their friends?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Save it for later! We need to get Hestia back right now!  </p><h2 id="4-the-little-guide" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>4: The Little Guide</h2><p><strong>Hestia:</strong> I can't thank you enough, really. Guess I shouldn't be going anywhere near the dungeon for a while.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> That's probably a good idea...<br><strong>Hestia:</strong> Still, you girls... Like I thought, you seem used to fighting those monsters.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Eh? You can tell?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> And weren't you calling us "outsiders" before...?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> So did you figure out that we're from another world?<br><strong>Hestia:</strong> Fufu, didn't I tell you? I'm a goddess. I knew all about that right from the start.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> So then, the one who called us to this world is...<br><strong>Hestia:</strong> Wait wait, that wasn't me. Gods using their powers on the lower world is off limits, as a rule.<br><strong>Hestia:</strong> Though with the way things are around here, it's causing problems between the gods too, so one of them besides me might have tried getting clever with the rules.<br><strong>Hestia:</strong> Anyway, with that out in the open, just what are you outsiders? I can tell a lot, but not quite that much. And can you tell me what you know about those monsters too?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Sorry for keeping this a secret from you, Hestia. In our world, we're known as "toji".<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> And those monsters are "aradama". They're native to our world.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Our job as toji is to defeat aradama. But when we were on a mission doing that, we fell in a hole... When we woke up, we somehow came into this world.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> We don't know how the aradama got here either.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Still, at the very least, it seems pretty likely one of the gods summoned us here.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Right. These "okatana" we're using have the power to purify any aradama.<br><strong>Hestia:</strong> Mmmmm...!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> O-Oi... Is something wrong, goddess?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Did you get a stomachache?<br><strong>Hestia:</strong> Then that means, you outsiders really are my savior!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Uwah, that made me jump!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Your savior...? What are you saying, Hestia?<br><strong>Hestia:</strong> I mean, you are, aren't you? You're here to defeat those arawhatevers, which means...<br><strong>Hestia:</strong> Once the dungeon's back to normal, my darling Bell-kun will come back home!<br><strong>Hestia:</strong> If that doesn't make you my saviors, what would!?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> O-Okay... No, I don't get it at all.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> But it's plain as day how happy she is about it.<br><strong>Hestia:</strong> Go ahead and ask me for anything you need, foreginers! If it'll help you get rid of those arawhatevers, I'd be happy to lend a helping hand or two!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> W-Will you really!? Then, can you teach us how to use magic!?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> (Can we actually use it too...?)<br><strong>Hestia:</strong> Ah, sorry. I can't teach you how to do that so suddenly.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> O-Oh, okay...<br><strong>Hestia:</strong> Yeah, but is there anything else?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...How about this. Our number one problem in clearing out the aradama is that none of us know our way around the dungeon.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah, you're right about that. The moment we got in there we got lost.<br><strong>Hestia:</strong> Hmmhmm... Then you want me to find a guide for you?<br><strong>Hestia:</strong> Leave it to me! I know just the person who can help you!<br><strong>Lilly:</strong> Now then, everyone, will you follow me. Ah, I'm Liliruca Arde. You can call me Lilly.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Sh-She's a kid...?<br><strong>Lilly:</strong> I am not a kid. I'm from a race known as the Pallum. For what it's worth, I'm 15.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Eh-!? She's older than me!?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> She looks like that, but she's almost me and Ellen's age... Seriously?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Mmm, it's a parallel world after all.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Um, by the way, Lilly...<br><strong>Lilly:</strong> Yes, what is it?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Can you... Use magic too?<br><strong>Lilly:</strong> Yes, a bit. Though it's not the kind that's useful in combat.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Then, what kind of magic is it? Is it like the kind that lets you fly through the air?<br><strong>Lilly:</strong> No, it's nothing that impressive...<br><strong>Lilly:</strong> I guess... This is a secret from everyone besides Bell-sama and them, but since you're all from another world, I think I can tell you. However, please keep this a secret from anyone else you meet here.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Okay, we won't tell anybody!<br><strong>Lilly:</strong> I use transformation magic. So long as my body stays mostly the same size, I can transform myself to look like anything I want.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> I see, there's transformation magic...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> What's wrong, Hiyori? I thought you said you weren't interested in magic?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> N-No... It's not like that...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> I can understand though. If you could use transformation magic, you could do something to cover up that eternal part of yours.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Kh... I'm done talking about this. We need to keep moving forward. We don't have time to talk if we want to destroy all the aradama deeper in.  </p><h2 id="5-a-bad-feeling-and-jagamaru-kun" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>5: A Bad Feeling and Jagamaru-kun</h2><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Haaaaah-!<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> GAAAAaaaa...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Pant... Pant... Nice one, Juujou-san...!<br><strong>Lilly:</strong> You're all so strong! You completely overpowered those mosnters!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Still, the spectrum meter is reacting to something. We aren't done here.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I don't see any more aradama around though...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Kaoru, does your spectrum finder show anything?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Yeah, I'm checking it now... Tch, so that's how it's going to be.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Nn? What's wrong?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> They're down, below us. It's picking something up under here. And it looks like there's loads of 'em.<br><strong>Lilly:</strong> There's dozens of floors to this dungeon, so they must be deeper in.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> There's that many floors...!?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Don't worry. As far as I can tell from this thing, we shouldn't have to go that deep. Though they also don't seem to be right next to us... They couldn't make it easy.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Are you feeling tired, Kaoru?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Yeah... There's open spaces here and there, but fighting in these cramped tunnels can take a lot of extra effort from me.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Nenekirimaru's no good for fighting in here, huh. It's true that if you went all out, you'd cause more trouble than it's worth.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> There's a lot of side tunnels as well, so you never know where aradama could come from... It's mentally exhausting...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I know what you mean...<br><strong>Lilly:</strong> Would you all like to take a break here? With that little glowing rock of yours you can tell if the monsters come near us, right?<br><strong>Lilly:</strong> And also, it's a rule we follow to avoid exhaustion at all costs. Because in the worst case scenario, it means you might be unable to come back out.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...I see. Thank you, Lilly. Let's take a quick break, everyone.<br><strong>Lilly:</strong> In that case, I can provide you with food and drinks. It's another rule of the dungeon to recover properly as you progress.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Whoa, this is yummy! The outside is cold and crunchy, but the inside's still nice and hot!<br><strong>Lilly:</strong> Those are Jagamaru-kun, which Hestia-sama herself gives all of us to eat.<br><strong>Lilly:</strong> Please try a drink of this as well. It's effective in recovering your stamina.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Gulp, gulp... Phwaa-! Ahh, I feel alive again-!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You know, the adventurers really are amazing. I can't believe they always come down into the dungeon like this. And you too, Lilly-san, supporting them like this.<br><strong>Lilly:</strong> Ehehe, you think so? Though I think it's equally amazing the way you've been able to adapt coming down here for your first time.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> You're such a good girl, Lilly. I wish we could take you back to our world.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Uh, I think that would cause problems...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Anyway, Lilly. Could you tell us a bit more about the dungeon we're in now?<br><strong>Lilly:</strong> Ah, I can do that. Where should I start.<br><strong>Lilly:</strong> As I told you before, this dungeon is structured in a way with many dozens of floors. We are currently on the first floor.<br><strong>Lilly:</strong> And as you go deeper in the dungeon, the area of each floor grows larger. For that reason, exploring each layer becomes more and more difficult.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Oh. So that's why you said it's important not to waste your stamina as you keep going.<br><strong>Lilly:</strong> Right. Ordinarily, the early floors have weaker monsters, while the stronger monsters are only found the deeper you go. However, those monsters are unthinkably strong to be appearing on the first floor.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> And according to the spectrum finder, there's a lot more waiting for us up ahead.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Nn? Hang on... What if the aradama keep getting tougher the deeper we go in too...? They shouldn't, right?<br><strong>Lilly:</strong> I have no way of knowing...  The investigation the guild requested only covered the first floor.<br><strong>Lilly:</strong> So it's unknown how much stronger those monsters could be on the next floors...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Ughh... This has bad idea written all over it.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Y-Yeah...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Still, we might not be able to return home until we destroy all the aradama...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Lilly, can you give me one of those "Jagamaru-kun" too? It sounds like I'll need to build my stamina for the fighting ahead.<br><strong>Lilly:</strong> Yes, here you go. There's plenty more left, so if any of you want some, feel free to ask.  </p><h2 id="6-longing-for-power" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>6: Longing for Power</h2><p><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Pant... Pant... Pant... Damnit, the aradama really are getting stronger the lower we go...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> And with the floors getting wider, we have to move that much further... It's exhausting, isn't it...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> At least this looks like the last floor we need to clear out. I'm not picking up any aradama lower than this...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Even so, there's still lots of them left on this floor...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Wheeze... Wheeze... Wheeze...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Are you okay, Mihono...?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Y-Yeah... I-I can keep fighting...<br><strong>Lilly:</strong> Everyone, you can't push yourselves to your limits. Why don't we return to the last floor, where it's safe, and have another break...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Ahh, we should... Nn? What? The spectrum meter is having a big reaction to something?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Not good, Hiyori! The aradama started moving in our direction! On top of that, I'm picking up a really big one in the middle of them!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Kh... We have to hurry, all of you!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It's no use! The aradama are already here!<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> GUAAAAAAAAAA-!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Shit! They're coming from all sides!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Tch, what got their attention so fast...!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> You don't think they were luring us in, do you...!?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> W-We have to fight, guys...! We can't afford to lose here...!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Hono-chan...! Right, I can still...!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Yeah! Let's show them what we've got!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> We're not about to lose to some aradama!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Everyone...!<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> GURURURURUR...!<br><strong>Lilly:</strong> There's monsters in every direction! Be careful, all of you!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Lilly, stay in the center of us! Form a ring! Don't show them your backs!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> (But... In our exhausted state, taking on this many aradama will be...)<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> (What do we do... Is there something we haven't thought of...? At this rate, before long...)<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> (Damnit... If only I were stronger...!)<br><strong>Lilly:</strong> H-Here they come!<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> GUGAAAAAAAAAAAA-!!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Kh...!<br><strong>???:</strong> Fusillade Fallarica!<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> GUAAAAaaaaaa...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Wha... That power...!?<br><strong>???:</strong> Ha...!<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> OOOOOooooo...<br><strong>Lefiya:</strong> Everyone, are you unhurt!?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Ah... You two...!<br><strong>Ais:</strong> Hestia-sama asked us to help you... This time, it's our turn to...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Ais and Lefiya, right? We owe that goddess big time.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> For sure! You showed up in the nick of time!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Hono-chan, we can do it now...!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah, with those two with us...!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Let's go, everyone! If we all work together, we should be able to defeat every aradama here!  </p><h2 id="7-asking-for-the-impossible" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>7: Asking for the Impossible</h2><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yaaaaaah-!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Teryaaaa-!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Yaah-!

I'm fine, sorry.<br><strong>Ais:</strong> What's wrong...? Were you hurt...?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> No, that's not it...<br><strong>Ais:</strong> Then what is...? With how strong you are, you should have been able to beat that...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> How strong I am...?<br><strong>Ais:</strong> Nn... I can't move like you can. You're so much faster...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Are you talking about "jin'i"?<br><strong>Ais:</strong> Maybe...<br><strong>Ais:</strong> Ever since I saw you fight the first time, I've been thinking about it... How can I move like you did...<br><strong>Ais:</strong> I'm jealous of that strength of yours...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> No, I'm the one feeling jealous of you.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> If I could use magic the way you do... I know now's not the time to get caught up in thought... But still, I can't help it...<br><strong>Ais:</strong> We're both alike, I think... We both want to become stronger...<br><strong>Ais:</strong> But, like I have my strength, you have yours... What we've experienced is completely different...<br><strong>Ais:</strong> So, your strength is inside... Umm...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Strength has to come from within... You mean? Ahh, you might be right about that.<br><strong>Ais:</strong> Nn...<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> GUGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-!!!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Listen to that roar...! That aradama's not like the others!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Tch, is it time for the boss fight already?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Kh... If we want to stand a chance of beating that, we'll have to deal with the surrounding aradama first.<br><strong>Ais:</strong> Don't worry... We'll take care of any of the other monsters in your way...<br><strong>Ais:</strong> Lefiya, can you help me...?<br><strong>Lefiya:</strong> Of course, Ais-san! I'll begin chanting!<br><strong>Lefiya:</strong> Proud warrior, snipers of the forest. Take up your bows before the advancing plunderers.

I'll do it!<br><strong>Ais:</strong> Lefiya, now...!<br><strong>Lefiya:</strong> Tinge them with flame, the lamplight of the forest. Release them, the fire arrows of the fairies. Falling like rain, burn away the savages...<br><strong>Lefiya:</strong> Fusillade Fallarica!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Let's end this battle!

We just barely made it safely back outside.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Ughh, I'm dead tired though. I can't believe as soon as we were done with the aradama, this world's monsters started coming out.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> It really feels like we made it out by a hair's breadth.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> If Lilly-san hadn't shown us the shortest route, we would have been in a lot of trouble back there...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Thanks for everything, Lilly-san! You saved our butts!<br><strong>Lilly:</strong> Ehehe, this is sort of embarrassing.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> I want to thank you two again as well. You saved us when you arrived. I'm grateful.<br><strong>Ais:</strong> Nn...<br><strong>Lefiya:</strong> You're welcome, I'm just glad we were able to help.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah... But, is this going to work? We were in the dungeon, weren't we? When we first came to this world.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> O-Oh yeah, we were...! Don't tell me, we have to go back in there to get back to our world...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Oi oi, don't joke like that...!<br><strong>Hestia:</strong> Fear not. The god who summoned you here wouldn't work you all that hard.<br><strong>Lilly:</strong> Ah, it's Hestia-sama.<br><strong>Hestia:</strong> Sorry to put you through that, Supporter-kun. You too, Wallenwhatever-kun and Elf-kun.<br><strong>Ais:</strong> No...<br><strong>Lefiya:</strong> Dealing with those monsters was very important to us as adventurers, after all.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> So what now, goddess? How're we supposed to get back home?<br><strong>Hestia:</strong> Now now, don't be in such a rush. Before we get to that, there's one thing I want to confirm with you outsiders.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> And what's that...?<br><strong>Hestia:</strong> Remember, before you went into the dungeon? How you said you wanted to learn magic.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Huh? But... I thought you said you couldn't teach us so suddenly?<br><strong>Hestia:</strong> Yes, but only so soon.<br><strong>Hestia:</strong> You know, with a powerful enough grimoire, just reading it would be enough to let you use magic. Though something like that is too pricey for me to get my hands on.<br><strong>Hestia:</strong> But that's not the only way to learn.<br><strong>Hestia:</strong> Which brings me to my point. Hey, outsiders, how'd you like to be a part of my familia?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Hestia-sama's familia...?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> First off, what's a familia?<br><strong>Hestia:</strong> It means my household.<br><strong>Hestia:</strong> If you were to join my household, I could begin giving you outsiders the grace of gods, Falna.<br><strong>Hestia:</strong> Whether or not that'll give you magic depends on the person, but if you kept working as an adventurer, you might someday get your hands on a grimoire, you know?<br><strong>Hestia:</strong> So, how about it? So long as you promise not to lay a hand on Bell-kun, I'll welcome you with open arms.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Umm... I do want to use magic, but...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah... But...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Mmm... It's a tempting offer though...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Yo-? What do you think, Hiyori?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> I...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> No, I should stop.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> What happened today helped me understand. In order to become stronger, I should improve my own skills first.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Besides, there's something I need to do in our world. You all feel the same, don't you?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Well, yeah. Besides, staying behind here as an adventurer sounds like a whole lot of work.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> We've all kind of said it, but I love our world too much to stay, so there's nothing I can do but give up on magic.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Me too. I wouldn't want Chii-nee to get all worried about me.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Fufu, that's right.<br><strong>Hestia:</strong> Is that so? Well, I wasn't expecting you to go along with it anyway.<br><strong>Hestia:</strong> Anyway, this is farewell, outsiders. Oops, looks like it's already starting.<br><strong>Lilly:</strong> Goodbye, everyone! It made me very happy the way you praised me back then!<br><strong>Lefiya:</strong> We need to say our thanks as well! Thank you very much for defeating those monsters, for the sake of this world!<br><strong>Ais:</strong> If there's ever another chance...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Thanks, Ais. It's because of you that I was able to reexamine myself. If we ever meet again... I'll look forward to it.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...Nn, where are we?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Huh? Why were we sleeping out here?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Now that you mention it...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Ahh... I feel like I had a long dream...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> You did? What a coincidence, I had one too.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> I feel the same way, but... Nothing. I can't remember anything about it.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> (But, that's strange...? I suddenly feel the need to train with Kanami...)<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> (Fu... Well, it's not so bad once in a while.
