Even if it's nutritious, it tastes like crap.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Hm? What are you talking about? These packs are great tasting and perfectly nutritious; the complete portable meal.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...Huh? Wait, so what's no good then?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> The fact that I've been ignoring a possibility up until now, is all.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I realized something. Haven't there been an awful lot of cases of aradama stealing things recently?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> And, from a possibility in that... I've formed a hypothesis!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Ooh, some new way to run into tons of aradama-chan!?  
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Which is, is it possible that, when a subset of aradama steal objects from humans, they're wanting human attention?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Even when aradama steal objects, I don't believe they use them in any way.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> What do you think, Shichinosato-san? About my "attention seeking aradama" theory!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> You're looking all smug about it... but I really don't care.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Ehh, but don't you think it's extraordinarily bad that something this vital was overlooked until now-?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> I said I don't care! Did you call me here just to tell me that...?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I'd like your help in collecting data on aradama, the same as usual-.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> To test my earlier theory, I think we'll need a certain amount of concrete data as proof-- for example, what do they actually steal?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> So you're saying I'll get to play with loads of aradama-chan!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Yes, though, the thing is... For this assignment, I'll need you to fight without bringing the aradama down right away, while limiting damage to the surroundings as much as possible.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Because the primary goal of this is observation, not defeating the aradama. Can you work around that?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Hell no! Why do I gotta sit around waiting in a fight?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> If you hold yourself back a little, won't it feel 2-3 times more enjoyable when you do defeat the aradama?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Yeah right. Call me up when you're done with this watch-'n-wait borefest.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Hmm, her reaction was within expectations. Though, collecting data on my own...<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> The best case would be to find someone who might have a different sort of interest in aradama than Shichinosato-san...<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> !<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> So that's why you gave me a call then, Tsugumin!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Yes, because of your personal views on aradama. I was sure you would be interested.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Yes! This theory that aradama are stealing things because they want attention from people, it's very interesting!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I think it sounds plausible too.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> If my hypothesis is correct, and there are aradama with the nature to seek out humans of their own accord, it may even be possible for some to be tamed as pets.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> That's right. It'd be wonderful if it could be more common for aradama to have relationships like Kaoru and Nene do.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I'll help you with this, Tsugumin. Do you have any ideas where there might be aradama looking for attention?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I've already taken care of researching that. So then, shall we go-?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Let's go!  </p><h2 id="misogi---tsugumi-end-trial-and-error-towards-a-dream" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Misogi - Tsugumi: End]: Trial and Error Towards a Dream</h2><p><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> From what a local farmer said, there are frequent cases of aradama stealing their crops.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> There don't seem to be any attacks on people either. The theory's sounding more and more credible!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Yes. It's considered impossible for aradama to grow accustomed to humans, but this shows promise, doesn't it-. I'm feeling inspired now-.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Take a look at the lettuce scattered around here! It couldn't have happened naturally, and there's no signs of it being eaten!<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> ......<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> This looks to be a bingo, fufu.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Though, you know, these aradama stealing crops and running off into the mountains are somewhat like monkeys, aren't they-.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Like monkeys, we might be able to get along with them! Rather than a troupe of apes, it's a troupe of aradama!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Gathering data here is a step towards that.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> If we can find something resembling an aradama nest here, we can investigate whether they've collected man-made objects and so on... Though maybe I'm hoping for too much just yet.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> We'll just have to pray we get lucky~.  
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Let's close the distance quick so they won't escape, and get some data while we're at it!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Woo-!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> That's how excited I am now, to shout that-.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> It looks like there's stuff besides stolen crops littered around.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> From what we've confirmed from missions so far, aside from sometimes stealing food, they also steal a variety of things, from items that cover daily needs to objects made of processed metals.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> We can't be sure the aradama are responsible for all of this, and I don't see any rhyme or reason behind it, but couldn't this be enough to say aradama are interested in humans, in a way?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I think it's plenty of basis to do a practical test of our hypothesis with that aradama.<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> ......<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Alright, let's get closer. If the theory holds up, so long as we don't attack, it should be fine.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Come on, let's be friends!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> There's nothing to be afraid of-.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> We can get along with Nene, so surely other aradama can do it too...<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> ......<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> KSHAAAAAAAAA!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> ...So this was no good.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> That was even more shocking than getting attacked by aradama usually is...<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> If more of them are coming out, we can't give up hope just yet!<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> GUGGGGIII...!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> That was exhausting...<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> They were all duds. I wonder if this hypothesis was incorrect... Either way, Kohagura-san. Thank you very much for joining me here.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I had fun too, so it's no problem!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> That's good then. Still, for what reason do aradama steal objects-? Causing that much disturbance will mean toji are sent to exorcise them...<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Ah...! It couldn't be that they're doing things to draw attention so that they can be exorcised, is it...?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Mmmghh...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> You sure are dedicated to this, Tsugumin. What are you hoping to do by learning so much about aradama?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I want to find peaceful uses for aradama... Achieving some form of coexistence is my dream. It might be little more than a fantasy of mine now, but I'm serious about it-.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Oh! Tsugumin! Your dream is the same as mine! We're like-minded comrades!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Well now-. That's a pleasant surprise-.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I'd like to ask if we could share more information from now on, if that's alright with you, Kohagura-san.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Of course it is!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Good, this should help me make progress in data gathering. Now then, on the way back, how about we discuss my idea from earlier-?<br>(best quality I could find it for now)</p><p><a href="https://streamable.com/tvpstr">https://streamable.com/tvpstr</a></p><h2 id="misogi---kofuki-start" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Misogi - Kofuki: Start]:</h2><p><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> ...Let's put an end to things here for today.

Nobody's gonna come back with "Yeah, it was fun," after they tell you about how they got their milk pudding stolen!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...And that's what she said, but, what do you think?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> This isn't the sort of conversation we should have in the middle of a mission, is it.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> It's not like we're finding any aradama-chan, so just loosen up.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I thought I bought you another milk pudding though...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> No duh? Like I was gonna let you off eating it like that. But still, what do you think, Mihocchi?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> What do you mean, what do I think...? She said you sounded like you were having fun, right?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> If you're having fun, then isn't that all good?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Yeah, I guess, but still, it kinda rubs me the wrong way somehow.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I believe that's not the point Ban Tsugumi was trying to get across, but that you've changed, Shichinosato Kofuki.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Huh? I haven't changed a bit. It's not like, back then, I never had fun when I wasn't playing with aradama-chan or anything.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I think you've changed a lot though?

Actually, did you change? Sorry, I don't really remember.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> ...Fufufu.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> It seems that the old Shichinosato-san really didn't think about anything besides aradama.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Well duh, wasn't that obvious?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> (On top of that, when everyone around you are people like me... It's only natural that it would change you.)<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Though, whether or not you change, you'll still be Shichinosato-san.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I don't think you need to think so deeply about it.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> You get real annoying when you're explaining stuff, y'know.
