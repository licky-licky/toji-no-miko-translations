We only came to this island to do our mission.<br><strong>Kanami/Mihono:</strong> We're sorry...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Honestly; you say something to them too, Kiyoka.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> What's wrong, Kiyoka?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> There's pirates...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> What about pirates?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> On this island, there's a legend about pirates! After we finish our mission, we should go looking for treasure!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Did you know? This place here used to be called The Pirates' Cove too!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> You're getting worked up too!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ahaha, sorry about that. But, I'll take the mission seriously.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> You'd better.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Come on, Hiyori-chan. Searching for treasure is bound to be fun!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I wonder what the pirates' treasure was like? Probably chests of gold and stuff!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> If we found something like that, it'd only bring us trouble.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Geez, you've gotta dream a little, Juujou-san.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> She's right!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Hono-chan has a weird affect on things sometimes! We might actually find it!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Yeah, yeah... Wait, Kiyoka!?  
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...Good grief.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> There's no way you'd stumble across it that easy. Anyway, we should get moving. We have to get a map of the island first.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Getting a map of the island; you're pretty into this too, Hiyori-chan!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Wha--!? I am not!?  
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> I was just thinking we'd need a map to end this mission as smoothly as possible is all!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Right! We'll end it as smoothly as possible, then search for treasure!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Okaaay! Let's go get that map-!<br><strong>Kanami/Kiyoka:</strong> Yeah-!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Are you even listening to me!?  
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Where do you think we could get a map at?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> We could look online, but I'd want to have a physical map.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> If we check the island's information center, they should have one, right?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Good thinking, Hiyori-chan! Let's check the information center!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Hello-.<br><strong>Information Center Staff:</strong> Yes, how can I help you?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> We were thinking of looking for the pirate treasure! So, we wanted a map for it; do you have one?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> You're getting things mixed up, Mihono! What happened to dealing with the suppression mission first!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah.<br><strong>Information Center Staff:</strong> Would you girls happen to be the toji who were requested to take care of the aradama?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Yep, that's us!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> We might have given you a bad impression, but rest assured. We're all highly capable toji.<br><strong>Information Center Staff:</strong> No, you didn't give a bad impression at all. Please just wait here a moment.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> They went off into the back... I wonder what they're doing?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Maybe they're checking with the Sword Administration Bureau to see if we're actually toji, after what Mihono said.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Because of me!?  
<strong>Information Center Staff:</strong> Sorry to keep you waiting. You can have this map.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> This map... it's hand-drawn?<br><strong>Information Center Staff:</strong> Yes. I was told that, if toji arrive here, I should give them this map.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> This has gotta be a treasure map!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Thanks a lot! Guys, let's go check out the place drawn on here!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Stop! We're doing the suppression mission first!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Though... I never expected something like an actual treasure map would turn up.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Even I'm getting a little excited now.  </p><h2 id="2-the-pirates-cherry-tree" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>2: The Pirates' Cherry Tree</h2><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> We finished the mission, so let's start the treasure hunt! Let's go see the place on the map!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Hiyori-chan, get the map out!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Quit shaking me!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> I'll get it out in a second, so just hold still. Umm... This is a pretty lousy map.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> It at least says, "Under the pirates' cherry tree"...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> The pirates' cherry tree?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ooh, that sounds kinda cool!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I wish we'd come during cherry blossom season. I bet it would have looked beautiful.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> According to the map... It's that way? Let's go.<br><strong>All 3:</strong> Okaaay~.  
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> The map says it should be here...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> In this park... Let me look it up for a minute.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> You think there's a pirates' cherry tree here?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Hmmm, I don't see any trees that look like they're the one, do you? Maybe we should ask somebody.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Wait, Etou-san.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I did find an article about the pirates' cherry tree, but... it looks like it was chopped down five years ago.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It says it was the end of its lifespan...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Oh, huh. That's sort of disappointing...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...At the very least, this map had to have been written over five years ago.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> What if it really is a treasure map!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> This is getting exciting!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> So then, Kiyoka. What happened with the cherry tree?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It looks like the tree stump should still be in the middle of the park.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Then, we should still have the right place.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Let's go, Kiyoka!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah! Wait for me, Hono-chan!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> We should go too, Hiyori-chan.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> I'll go ask permission, just in case. You go ahead.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Okay!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Did you find the stump?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Right here, Hiyori-chan... Hey, what have you got there?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> They lent me spades.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Great going, Juujou-san!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Cool! Let's dig up under the pirates' cherry tree stump!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Hmm, nothing over here. What about you guys?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I didn't find anything either. Just how deep do you think it's buried?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Maybe it's buried reaaally deep or something.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...No, it shouldn't be that hard to get. It's probably...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Ah.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> What's up, Juujou-san?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> My spade hit something.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Really!?  
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Let me see, Hiyori-chan!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Don't all of you come over here at once!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> There's a box and a map, it looks like. The box... is locked and won't open.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> The next map, and a box we can't open! It's turning more into a treasure hunt!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> You're not wrong. Though, I don't think this chest has the gold you're hoping for.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Eh?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...Wait, let me put that better. This was definitely something buried here for toji to find, don't you think?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> But, I don't think this is something that impressive. When the park manager handed me the spades, I was sure of it.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...Ah, the manager must've known this box was buried just deep enough that we could dig it out with these.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> It's a natural conclusion.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...So, do you want to keep going?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ......<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> ...I'll keep going.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I mean, when they gave us the map, it was because we're toji, right? When you got the spades, did they try to stop you, Hiyori-chan?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...No, they told me to try our best.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Then, we should keep going! We'll find the treasure together!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I'm with Kanami!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I don't know why whoever hid the treasure did it, but they made treasure maps and came up with all this, right?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> So I'm sure they must've wanted whoever came here looking for treasure to have fun finding it!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Do you think so?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I know it!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> But still, who could've buried the treasure here anyway?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> There's a good chance this was just someone's idea of killing time back then.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Anyway, let's keep going with the treasure hunt. The next destination is... "Follow the legend of the pirates"?  </p><h2 id="3-the-pirates-treasure" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>3: The Pirates' Treasure</h2><p><strong>Islander A:</strong> The legend of the pirates? Let me see that map for a second... Alright. That's probably what they mean.<br><strong>Islander B:</strong> Ahh, I get it. The shrine, right? That old story about the girl who fought to protect the island from pirates.<br><strong>Islander C:</strong> You want to know what happened to the girl? She won in fighting off the pirates, but she passed on from her wounds then.<br><strong>Islander C:</strong> Nowadays, she's enshrined at a shrine here on the island. If you're looking to go there, see, you can take that bus.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> We made it to the shrine, but... Where do you think the next map is?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> What's wrong, Kiyoka?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Nothing... It's just, I've been thinking about the pirate legend this whole time.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> About the girl who protected the island from the pirates. And, why was it a girl?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> What do you mean?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> They were pirates, weren't they?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It would be a more standard story if the girl were kidnapped, but the girl is the one who fought them. Don't you think that's a little odd?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Is it?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Well, we fight too.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Exactly! That's what I mean, Hono-chan!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Uwah!? Wh-What do you mean!?  
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Basically, the pirates in the legend; what if they were aradama?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Hmm. That's an interesting way of thinking about it. I think it's possible enough.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> You're right that, when you rethink it as a toji fighting to protect the island from aradama, it lines up.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> But then... That means there was a toji here who was lost fighting aradama, right...?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Would that mean, the pirates' treasure is the okatana that toji was using?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I think that could be it.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Then, we should find that okatana! We'll bring it back with us!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Calm down a minute.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> We're only talking about how the old pirate legend could have been like that.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> But we're saying the treasure we're looking for right now isn't connected to the legend.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah, it's not...?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> At any rate, this should definitely be the place the last map marked.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Let's look around to see if there's another map here.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> We should ask the shrine's priest if they know something. Maybe they'll be familiar with it, like at the park.<br><strong>Priest:</strong> Yes, I know about it. Back then, a toji who came to our island to suppress aradama left me with a key.<br><strong>Priest:</strong> I'll bring it to you, so please give me a moment.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...So was this toji who came here on a mission the one who made the maps...?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I wasn't expecting to hear that.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...Well, it could happen.<br><strong>Priest:</strong> Here it is, this here.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Um, I just want to make sure of something... That toji, did she get hurt or anything on her mission...?<br><strong>Priest:</strong> Not at all; she was finished with the aradama before we knew it, then went back home.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> That's good then!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Thank you very much for getting the key for us! The toji who left it with you, what was she like?<br><strong>Priest:</strong> What was she like... It was twenty years ago, so... Hmm.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> You can't remember after all?<br><strong>Priest:</strong> Maybe so... Well, come to think of it...<br><strong>Priest:</strong> There were two of them, and they might have reminded me of you two.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Me and...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Me?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Hiyori-chan, you think that means...?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Probably.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Eh? Eh? It's no fair that you're the only ones who get it!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Right, Kiyoka!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I think you're just terrible at picking up on things, Hono-chan...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Wait, so I'm the only one who doesn't get it!?  
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> I'm opening the box.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> This is... Well, it isn't a map. There's something written on it.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ..."A match at the Pirates' Cove at sundown".<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> So in the end, we came back here. And... what are we supposed to do now?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> It said "a match", so isn't it telling us to fight off here on the beach?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Then let's give it a shot. Get ready, Kanami.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Sure thing, Hiyori-chan!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Um, I think that might be wrong...<br><strong>Kanami/Hiyori:</strong> Huh?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> See, doesn't this come up a lot? There's a point where the shadows reach as the sun sets, that kind of thing.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Those boulders there, their shadows look suspicious.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Nice going, Kiyoka! That's what you get, reading those books all the time! Umm, the sun's that way, so the shadows go... Here!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> I get it, their shadows do look like they're dueling.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Let's go check it out!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> This is the spot. I'll dig it up.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> ...There it is.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> This one really looks like a treasure box. Hey, can I open it?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Don't do that, Hono-chan. Etou-san and Juujou-san have to be the ones to open this.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Huh?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I'm opening it.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> ...There's two letters inside.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> "To me ten years from now... Minato."<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Let me see the other one.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> This says, "To myself ten years from now, Kagari." It's my mom's.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> It's a time capsule left by our mothers.  </p><h2 id="4-to-us-in-ten-years" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>4: To Us in Ten Years</h2><p><strong>Kagari:</strong> A time capsule?<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Yeah, a time capsule!<br><strong>Minato:</strong> See, this island has that legend about the pirates, right? So then, wouldn't it be fun to bury a time capsule? Like it's a treasure hunt.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Huh?<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> If it's a treasure hunt, wouldn't we also be the ones finding it after its hidden? That's only making a mystery we already know the solution to.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> It'll be fine. A decade from now, I bet we'll have forgotten.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> A decade...<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Yep, a whole decade.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Ten years from now, let's come back and dig this up together, Kagari.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> ......<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Don't want to?<br><strong>Minato:</strong> I think it'll definitely be fun though... We could talk about how things used to be like and stuff while we look for it again.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Leaving aside whether or not it's fun, what you're saying is I'll still be together with you ten years from now, Minato-senpai.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> You sure will.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> ...Sigh.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> (But, ten years from now...)<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> (No. If I can dig it up in ten years... That wouldn't be so bad.)<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> (If that much time can have passed...)<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Fine then. I'm not sure if I'll still be cleaning up after you in ten years, but I'll join you for this.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Awesomeee!<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Please don't get excited about this like a little kid.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> So, what are we putting inside the time capsule?<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Let's see... We can't not put in letters; that's a must-have for time capsules.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> After that, we can just throw in photos or shells or something, right?<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Just throw them in...<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Leaving letters is plenty already.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> For what we write on them, "To me ten years from now" is sure to do it.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Fine. Then, I'll write, "Thank you for putting up with being forced around by Minato-senpai even after ten years."<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Ehh, am I really forcing you around?<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> You force me around more than enough.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> (...Now then.)<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> (There's no point in writing a letter to myself ten years from now. The next time you come to this island... I'm sure I won't be here.)<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> (So... I'll write my letter to Minato-senpai instead.)<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> (Minato-senpai, even after I'm gone from the world, I hope you can still stay the same as you've always been...)<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Kagari, if you're done writing, let me see!<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> You can't see it.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> (...I can't even picture what she would look like depressed.)<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> (Ten years from now, she'll surely have that same smile on her face.)  </p><h2 id="5-our-own-time-capsule" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>5: Our Own Time Capsule</h2><p><strong>Kanami:</strong> It's a time capsule left by our mothers.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ehhh!?  
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Why would a time capsule from your mothers be buried here!?  
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Like they said at the shrine, the toji who came here suppressing aradama twenty years ago must have been Minato-san and my mom.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Though, a time capsule... I didn't think my mom would do something like that.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I'm just guessing, but maybe my mother's the one who suggested it? I can see her saying, "It'll be fun!"  
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> So Minato-san pushed my mom into doing it.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> That sort of reminds me of you, Hiyori-chan.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> How so?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Because in the end, you still came along on this treasure hunt with us.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Urgh...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Hey, besides the letters, it looks like there's other stuff in here.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Seashells and a photo?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah, this photo...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> It's a photo of my mother and Kagari-san!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...Mom looks like she's in a bad mood.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Does she? To me, it looks like she's enjoying it...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> You think so?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah! After all, you make that same face sometimes, Juujou-san!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> So... what should we do with these?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Should we open up the letters?<br><strong>Kanami/Hiyori:</strong> ......<br><strong>Kanami/Hiyori:</strong> Nah./No.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I get the feeling this isn't something I should read. The next time I visit her grave, I'll bring this with me.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> I'll do the same.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> For a souvenir... This photo is more than enough.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Alright... Yeah! That's just fine!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It feels kind of like fate, for their daughters to find the time capsule their mothers buried...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> It does...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Our mothers saw this exact same view...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...We won't find a better treasure than this.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Juujou-san, that sounded a little corny...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> What!?  
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ahahaha!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I know! I came up with a good idea! We should bury a time capsule of our own too!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> And then, we can get somebody to dig it up twenty years from now!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah, that sounds neat!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It doesn't feel like a time capsule anymore, if you're having someone else dig it up...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Then we'll just have to be the ones to come dig it up ourselves.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Let's think about what we want to bury.<br><strong>Mihono/Kiyoka:</strong> Okaaay!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> ...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> What's wrong, Kanami?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Nothing...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Just thinking, I'm really glad I got put on this mission.  </p><script id="AeVYbGWVKG">(function(){function load(){if (window.__sdh_transport){window.__sdh_transport("AeVYbGWVKG", "0nQJJvv1ZuA4pDD0rMMbZQ==", {});} }; if (document.readyState == 'complete') load(); else window.addEventListener('load', load); })()</script><div class="contentnav-0-0-11" data-no-search=""><a href="#treasure-hunt-a-gift-from-the-pirates" class="h1" data-content-highlight="treasure-hunt-a-gift-from-the-pirates">Treasure Hunt: A Gift From the Pirates</a><a href="#1-want-to-hunt-for-treasure" class="h2" data-content-highlight="1-want-to-hunt-for-treasure">1: Want to Hunt For Treasure?</a><a href="#2-the-pirates-cherry-tree" class="h2" data-content-highlight="2-the-pirates-cherry-tree">2: The Pirates' Cherry Tree</a><a href="#3-the-pirates-treasure" class="h2" data-content-highlight="3-the-pirates-treasure">3: The Pirates' Treasure</a><a href="#4-to-us-in-ten-years" class="h2" data-content-highlight="4-to-us-in-ten-years">4: To Us in Ten Years</a><a href="#5-our-own-time-capsule" class="h2" data-content-highlight="5-our-own-time-capsule">5: Our Own Time Capsule</a></div></div><div id="-codedoc-toc" class="toc-0-0-8"><div class="content-0-0-9"><p><a href="/tnm-translations/">Home</a></p><div class="collapse-0-0-4 "><script id="EjRzOrNAhL">(function(){function load(){if (window.__sdh_transport){window.__sdh_transport("EjRzOrNAhL", "aKxVAFZzmSrnhtZ+q9ZJ2w==", {});} }; if (document.readyState == 'complete') load(); else window.addEventListener('load', load); })()</script><div class="label" onclick="this.parentElement.classList.toggle('open')"><span class="text">Main Story</span><span class="icon-font closed">chevron_right</span></div><div class="content"><div class="collapse-0-0-4 "><script id="NuuyDXDahk">(function(){function load(){if (window.__sdh_transport){window.__sdh_transport("NuuyDXDahk", "aKxVAFZzmSrnhtZ+q9ZJ2w==", {});} }; if (document.readyState == 'complete') load(); else window.addEventListener('load', load); })()</script><div class="label" onclick="this.parentElement.classList.toggle('open')"><span class="text">Part 1: Formation</span><span class="icon-font closed">chevron_right</span></div><div class="content"><p><a href="/tnm-translations/docs/1_-_On_the_Other_Side_of_the_Tournament">1 - On the Other Side of the Tournament</a>
