Writing up a report after every single mission is getting to be a real chore.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Be thankful we have a computer database now. The way things were organized several years ago was much worse.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Worse than this, huh... Just imagining it gives me chills.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Can I help?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> You can help by not helping. You're just going to end up giving us more work here.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Hey, Maki onee-san! That was mean!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> But it's the truth. There's no other way I can break it to you. Besides, you're just looking to use this as an excuse to stay up late, aren't you? Go to bed, Yume.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> First you treat me like I'm a nuisance, and now you treat me like a kid! You really are mean!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> We should take a break here, everyone. I made you all some black tea.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Ara, thank you very much, Yomi-san.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Sure, we could use some rest.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> You're so thoughtful, Yomi onee-san! I'll have some! ...Ughgh!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Th-This stuff... Smells like that stomach medicine I had to take... Is this poisoned...?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...I-It has a somewhat distinct, unique flavor for black tea, doesn't it?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes, it's known as lapsang souchong. The leaves are smoke dried over pinewood fires, adding a rich aroma to it.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Nearly all production of lapsang souchong happens in Great Britain, making it very rare to find in Japan. I was lucky to obtain this today.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Black tea itself is said to have been first invented when military forces were transporting Chinese tea leaves, which fermented and became black tea. Though, of course, there are many theories as to its origin.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> When making this kind of tea, you must always use hard water. On top of that, if you don't manage the temperature of the water carefully, the aroma will be lost.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> ......<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> .........<br><strong>Yume:</strong> ............<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ......? Is something wrong?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> No, it's just, I've never heard you talk that much before...<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I was only answering her question. I do like black tea.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Is that so? Yomi-san, I'd be happy if you could speak this freely more often, at least between the four of us.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Eh... Y-Yes. I... I'll keep that in mind.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> And thanks for making us tea, Yomi. It was a good change of pace.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I see. I'm glad you liked the lapsang souchong.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Nobody said they liked the tea though...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> What's wrong, Yume? You hardly drank yours.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> ...Eh? Ahh, I was just thinking, the caffeine will make it harder to sleep... Right! S-So I'm going to bed!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Nice work, Yomi. You put Yume to bed in a flash. Ahaha.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> R-Right...  </p><h2 id="2-ahh-so-mbarrisin" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>2: Ahh, So 'Mbarrisin</h2><p><strong>Maki:</strong> There's been a mass outbreak of aradama in the area... Thanks to that, we received an emergency dispatch.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Well I've been waiting for something like this!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Then let's get to work, everyone.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes, I'll follow your lead.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Sigh... Do we really have to write reports immediately after a night mission...?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Even as you say that, you're still faithfully compiling them. I like that about you, Maki-san.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Nn... I bet what you really like is seeing me suffer through this, isn't it.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Ara, don't be rude. All the help I've given you here should prove otherwise.<br><em>Yume starts poking around</em></p><p><strong>Maki:</strong> Oi, Yume. If you have nothing better to do, then go to bed.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Now you're being mean~! I was just waiting to see if you needed help with anything!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Or because you're too excited after fighting and now you can't sleep. That's the problem with ki-...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ah~! And now you're treating me like a kid again! Right!? Suzuka onee-san! Maki onee-san was about to say kids, wasn't she!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Excuse me...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> A-Ara, Yomi! Did you bring us tea?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes. To clear your tension after sortieing, I prepared a chamomile blend tonight.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> ...Nnnn? Yomi onee-san, something smells kinda like its burnt. Did you shower after we came back?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> That's... Um, these...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> You baked cookies too? Hooray! You gotta have cookies with tea, after all! ......Wait, these are burnt black...<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> My apologies; I haven't gotten used to cooking yet. Ahh, so 'mbarrisin.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Huh?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> What was that, Yomi?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> 'Mbarrisin?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Ah... Sorry you had to hear that. That's how we say we're embarrassed in the Akita dialect.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Kyahahaha! 'Mbarrisin! That's so weird-!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Yume!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Don't be disrespectful to the way others speak.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Yomi, don't worry about it now. ...But when we're on a mission, I need you to be more careful with your words.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> If we can't quickly and clearly understand you, in the worst case scenario, someone could lose their life. You wouldn't want that either, right?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Right. I'll bear that in mind from now on.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...Yomi. Moreover, these cookies. They didn't actually turn out that badly.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> (Today is the first time someone hasn't laughed at my dialect. Ahh, so 'mbarrisin. Bu's real joyus too...)  </p><h2 id="3-fear-the-namahage" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>3: Fear the Namahage</h2><p><strong>Yume:</strong> Nihihihi... I found it~! I found it~! I know what Yomi onee-san's scared of~!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Yomi onee-san's from Akita, so she should be scared of the "Namahage".<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Apparently a lot of people from Akita have some kind of childhood trauma about it.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> But she's older now, so is it still gonna scare her? I'll just have to do a little test.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I'll hide here where Yomi onee-san should be passing by...<br><em>Yomi comes by and Yume jumps out</em></p><p><strong>Yume:</strong> "ANY CRYBABIES 'ROUND HERE-!!"<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> -!! ............<br><strong>Yume:</strong> ...Gotcha~! Yomi onee-san, were you scared? You were scared, weren't you?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ............<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Uhh, huh? Yomi onee-san? Yomi oneeee-san?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> ...Eh, you're kidding. She's out cold?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> What's wrong, Yume? What are you and Yomi up to?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Eh, uh, nothing. Well, umm...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I just heard somewhere that Yomi onee-san was scared of the Namahage, so uh, I was just wondering how scared she'd be, and...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Yomi's unconscious!? Oi, Yomi! Yomi! Wake up! Pull yourself together! Yume! What did you do!?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> DAMNIT, YUME!! YOU'VE REALLY DONE IT THIS TIME!!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Shorry!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Hya!! N-Namahage!! The Namahage's scolding Tsubakuro-san...!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> U-Unn... ............<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ah... She passed out again.

What're you eating, Yomi onee-san?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Omusubi.　(munch munch...)<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Onigiri? [both are rice balls]<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> This isn't onigiri. It's omusubi. (munch munch...)<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Same difference. You're pretty picky.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Would you like one too, Tsubakuro-san? (munch munch...)<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I'm not really that hungry, but what else is in that onigiri?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Only salt. (munch munch...)<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Huhh? Who eats onigiri with just salt, not even a seaweed wrap?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I do. (munch munch...) When you wrap it in seaweed or add other ingredients, it becomes harder to appreciate the flavor of the rice.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Omusubi is simply rice and salt. That's the best.  (munch munch...)<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Huh... Well I guess you don't need anything else if the rice tastes good enough.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes. (munch munch...) With delicious enough rice, rice alone is enough of a meal.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> And rice itself is the greatest energy food. As you chew it, the starch is broken down and absorbed as sugars, which are very good for you.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Particularly brown rice, which is unparalleled as the world's perfect food. Eating white rice blended with brown rice will provide you in abundance all the nutrition needed to maintain a healthy body.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> By the way, Tsubakuro-san. You called these onigiri, but in fact the ones formed in a triangular shape are actually omusubi. That shape is meant to mimic that of a mountain.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Water is vital to making rice. Supposedly, it's intended to show respect to the mountains from which rivers flow. (munch munch munch...)<br><strong>Yume:</strong> O-Okay...<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Tsubakuro-san, would you like some omusubi as well? I'll share half of them with you. They're made from the delicious rice of Akita, where I was born.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Eh... I-I'm good for now. I'm not that hungry. Ahaha, I'll see you later-!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> (I think she had something like 20 of them there!? Who could eat even 10 onigiri with just salt-!? No way! I couldn't even eat 10 onigiri period!)<br><em>Yume runs off</em></p><p><strong>Yomi:</strong> But they're so delicious. (munch munch munch...)<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Though, I did make too many. I'll eat one more. The rest can be saved for a snack, dinner, a late night snack, tomorrow's breakfast, and then lunch. (munch munch...)  </p><h2 id="5-feelings-in-passing" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>5: Feelings in Passing</h2><p><strong>Yomi:</strong> .........<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> .........<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> .........<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...Satsuki Yomi, didn't you call me here...?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> .........<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...If you don't need anything, then I'll leave.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> It's about...

A normal elementary school student. I was a normal girl.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> There's gotta be something more, right?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ...There was nothing special about me. I was normal.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Anyway, the incident involved a bull type aradama appearing on the main road... Several vehicles had been totaled.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I was also nearly crushed by it.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> That's like something out of a monster movie.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes, I felt that I would die there.

Do you know any of the girls who saved you?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ...I only learned this later on, but the one directing that platoon was President Takatsu.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Really!?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes. I want to repay her for that someday.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Repay her? Like how? By beating more aradama?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ...Something like that.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Since that incident, I had never faced another bull type aradama...

So, won't you be fine after you kill one?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ...Will I?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> No...

I'll look forward to it.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Allow me to offer some advice before you attempt it. It's a common misconception, but it's actually harder for the scoop to be broken if you let it fully soak in the water.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Wait, really!?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> If only a part of it is wet, it will break more easily. Also, I suggest not aiming for larger ones and many at once.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Thanks for the tips, Yomi-onee-san.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> You did it, Tsubakuro-san.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Wasn't it way easier than the goldfish though, cause they aren't moving around on their own-?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Wait, where's Suzuka-onee-san and Maki-onee-san?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Over there, eating shaved ice.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> You can't go to a summer festival without trying this.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Strawberry, melon, lemon, blue hawaii... They had so many choices that I couldn't make my mind up.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> You went with blue hawaii, didn't you?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I couldn't imagine how it would taste. I only chose it on your recommendation. It's sweet and rather good.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> The only downside is it turns your tongue blue.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Fufu, and what's wrong with that? I find that sort of thing funny.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> I had a feeling you'd say something like that.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Hey...!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ah! Lucky-.

The limited run parfaits this place makes get a lot of talk for being good.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> You still like parfaits like you used to.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> So, what was the reason you called me here for?<br><strong>Akira:</strong> I had a little something to take care of around here. So I thought I'd give you a call. It's no fun eating by yourself, right?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ......<br><strong>Akira:</strong> I know you've probably got a lot going on too, but you've gotta take a breather every now and then.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I have to be part of a promotional photo shoot later today, so I can't stay here for very long.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Huhh? What're you doing a photo shoot for?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> You could say it has to do with the results of the Miss Five Traditions competition that was held the other day, I suppose.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Ahh, oh yeah, they put those out, huh.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> That reminds me, didn't you place pretty high yourself? I was surprised to hear it. I never thought you'd be up there.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Though, it must be boring as hell to sit through some photo shoot cause of it.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I can't neglect this, considering it's part of my duties as a toji.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> You got so straight laced. But, if that's what you're set on. You better do it right.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> You gonna be doing it in your uniform? They'd probably get mad if you wore something too casual; so a jacket like mine's out.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> You're probably right. Though, this time it's arranged for me to wear a valkyrie themed costume, along with Tsubakuro-san and the others.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> ......<br><strong>Akira:</strong> What're you talking about?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> You may not know about it, Akira, but valkyries were something that was part of Norse mythology--<br><strong>Akira:</strong> It's not like I don't know what valkyries are...! I'm asking, why're they making you dress up like that...!?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> That's what I'd like to know.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Yeah, I guess... The bureau does say to do some ridiculous stuff sometimes, huh.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> ...Well, do what you can. Whatever you're buying here'll be my treat.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Then, I'll have some tea. The black tea here is fairly good; it goes well with sweet foods.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> I'll have the same thing you're drinking then.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Ah, when you get the photos back, lemme see.

It came out really damn nice.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I didn't expect you to praise it so much.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Why not? Of course I would if it turned out this good.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> That's true. Though, I expected you to make fun of me.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Yeah, if I'm being honest, I was planning to, until I actually saw this. This whole valkyrie thing came out of nowhere.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> But this seems like it'll get some attention. Especially if Tsubakuro Yume and Kanami and the others are doing it.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> You got any other shots of you in this?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> No. This is the only one I brought with me.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> That's too bad. I really like the look of this one.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I see. I wasn't sure which photo to bring myself, so the others in the special defense team picked it out for me.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Huh. Didn't think you were so close with them, Yomi.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Does that mean you're pushing omusubi on them too?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Sometimes... I do.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> The omusubi you make are weirdly good, y'know.

I have some business I want to take care of before the end of the year, so please go without me.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Well, we can't do that. Since it's a big party, we got permission from Yukari-sama, saying we should all go.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> And Yume seems to be trying her best at getting something ready. It would be terrible if you weren't there.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Is that right... Then, I suppose I'll have to go. Is there anything I need to prepare in advance?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> It said on the invitation they're doing a gift exchange at the end of the party, so everybody needs to have one gift ready.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> With all the people that should be there, an exchange should be exciting. I should get mine ready straight away~.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Wait up, Suzuka! I want your advice on what to go with. I'm coming with you!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> The two of them left. Sigh... A gift exchange...<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> A gift which you can't anticipate who will be receiving it... That's a fairly difficult request.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> A present that would make anyone happy... Something that, no matter how many people got it, they would be happy with... Like, for example, delicious white rice...<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Ah-! That's what I could do.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I've reached a stopping point in my duties, so I'll quickly go out to do some shopping.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I may have bought a bit too much, but I suppose I'll get right to cooking. It's a good thing the kitchen was available.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Wow! Yomiyomi! I don't often run into you in a place like this~!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Are we maybe getting in your way?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> No, it's fine so long as I can use the faucet and stove. You can use the next counter over if it's fine with you.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Thanks for that then! Though, you sure have a lot of rice. And a nice big pot.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Are you getting ready for the Christmas party or something?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes, they said we would need something for the gift exchange, so I was thinking of using a type of rice that tastes delicious when cold to make omusubi.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Wow! Now that's a coincidence~! Kiyoka and I were here to make sweets for the present exchange too.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I'm baking cookies, and Ellen-san was going to make muffins.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I see, sweets are a standard gift for schoolgirls. You do often see them decorated for Christmas on sale around town.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> To give omusubi as a Christmas present... Maybe what I'm making will be out of place.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That's not true at all! Even with onigiri, depending on how you decorate them, they can definitely be cute Christmas presents!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> That's right~! Christmas style onigiri! If I got something like that, I'd be extra happy!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Um, if it's alright, could we help you make them? We'll make a Christmas style onigiri bento!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Definitely~! I'll help with Yomiyomi's onigiri bento too!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Musumi-san, Kohagura-san, thank you both. I appreciate you wanting to help. However, what I want to make is not onigiri bento.<br><strong>Kiyoka/Ellen:</strong> Eh?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> It's omusubi bento.  </p><h2 id="xmas-19---yomi-end-the-fun-of-giving" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Xmas' 19 - Yomi: End]: The Fun of Giving</h2><p><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Still though, Christmas style onigi... Ah-! Omusubi! How do you think those should look?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> For cakes, something called a Buche de Noel is popular. It's a roll cake decorated to look like a log of wood.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I see, a log of wood... If it were a sushi roll, I could make it look that way.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It wouldn't be very Christmas-like though, would it.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Since it's difficult expressing Christmas through the shape...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I know! For Christmas onigi... Ah-! Omusubi! What about this? You could bring out the feeling with red and green ingredients.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Red and green... In that case, I have umeboshi and shiyazuke for red, and shiso leaves for green.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Both of those would go perfect with onigi... Rice balls!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That was a nice save, Ellen-san.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Thank you both. With your suggestions, I should be able to make these omusubi feel like Christmas.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I'm glad we could help. Then, Ellen-san, we should get to making our own sweets now.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> You're right. Though, Kiyoka, you sure have a lot of shapes for cutting cookies.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> There's Santa Claus, reindeers, stars. They all feel like Christmas!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> They're all so cute, so I couldn't help but bring them out... Ah, I know! Satsuki-san, I came up with something good!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Something good?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> If you use my cookie cutters, and cut out a bit of omelette...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Wow! That's a pretty Christmas star! If you put that with Yomiyomi's rice balls...!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> It looks beautiful... Like a Christmas tree inside the bento box.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It really is! It turned out cuter than I thought!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Whoever gets this lunch box during the gift exchance will be very happy!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Yeah! I'm sure they'll be happy with it! I'm looking forward to tomorrow.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Thank you very much. Now I won't feel uncomfortable joining the party. Then, I'll be leaving now.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Please wait a minute! Since we're exchanging gifts, it'd be a waste to leave it at that!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> For the exchange, you can't not wrap it up all cute~.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> You do have a lot of ribbons and wrapping paper.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Maybe it would be cuter with a gap between the inside and outside! What do you think about this ribbon? Ah, or this one might be cute too!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> You always do have an awesome eye for design, Kiyoka~. Which do you like, Yomiyomi?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I... think both are fine. I'll go with whatever you choose.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Alright then! If we tie this ribbon on, it's ready!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> My omusubi became such a cute present... Musumi-san, Kohagura-san, I can't thank you enough.<br>The day of the Christmas Eve party.</p><p><strong>Mirja:</strong> Now then, for the final event of the party, all who joined us will be exchanging gifts. Everyone, do you all have your presents ready?<br><strong>Kanami/Mai/Yume:</strong> We dooo!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ......<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> What's the matter, Satsuki-san? The gift exchange is starting.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Musumi-san. Everyone seems to have brought such proper gifts, so are omusubi really alright...?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It'll be fine. I know for sure someone will be glad to get it. Aren't you excited to see the happy look on their face when they open it?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> The face they make... I hadn't thought about it, but you're right. I am a little interested.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Yomiyomi, Kiyoka! They're starting the gift exchange. Let's go over!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Alright.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> (The happy face of the person who receives it...

Konohana will be joining me at this evening's conference. I won't be needing an escort. You'll be assisting Shidou instead.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Understood.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Maki-san. If there's an urgent request for aid, please do all you can.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Sure, you can count on us.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> We'll be going then.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Huh-? Did Yukari-sama and Suzuka-onee-san go out somewhere?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> They just left for a conference.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh, but I thought I'd get Yukari-sama to play with me. It feels like you onee-sans have been really busy lately.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Apart from our aradama suppression missions, there's always something to take care of.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> But because of that, we haven't gotten to play at all. Or, actually, haven't we barely been able to get the four of us together lately?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> You're right. The rate of aradama appearances isn't dropping at all though. There's too much work needing toji to do it.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> If it's aradama, then I can beat as many as I have to!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> It's reassuring to have you, Tsubakuro-san, but you can't respond to aradama appearing in multiple locations at once.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Looking at the whole picture, even if you are very active, it won't reduce the overall work of toji that much.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Mmgh.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Though, I get what Yume's saying. But it's hard getting all of us time off at the same time.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Then, it'd be fine if it's not when we have time off?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ...What do you mean?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> You'll find out later~.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> There's something I've gotta go do real quick.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> What do you think she's up to?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> No idea... But, it's always a bit scary when Yume gets an idea.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Hey hey, Onee-san. There's a little something I want you do to for me, okay?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> If it's something I can manage, then I don't mind.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Y'see--<br>A few days later.</p><p><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I recieved a message from Yume earlier, but do you know what this is about, Yomi-san?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> No. I only know that, several days ago, she seemed to be planning something.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Well, we're lucky to be spending some time together, though it's only for a few hours.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> That's true. I'm slightly looking forward to it.  </p><h2 id="journey-to-the-west---yomi-end-it-might-be-nice-to-continue-our-journey" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Journey to the West - Yomi: End]: It Might Be Nice to Continue Our Journey</h2><p><strong>Maki:</strong> Hey... Yomi. What are we doing here, anyway...<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> What are you saying now, Pigsy? I'm Sandy. And we have to defeat these bandits to rescue our master.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Didn't think you'd get so into this... Uh, Sandy.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> That was a joke.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I wasn't sure what to expect when Tsubakuro-san invited us for training, but I didn't imagine we would be using the VR facilities.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> I'm still not completely used to this whole VR thing... But it's useful if you think of this as time spent strengthening the SDDT's coordination.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Though, did it really need to be done up like Journey to the West...?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> This training program seems to be popular. And also, I think Tsubakuro-san is fitting for the role of the Monkey King.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> The Monkey King's wild and uncontrollable side might be a good fit for her. Though, I'm not that on board with me being Pigsy...<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Is it bothering you? I didn't think you'd mind. I've heard that Pigsy is a popular character in China.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Is he really?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> But, right now, there's something we have to do to break our master out, Pigsy.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> That's what I mean, calling me Pigsy is... Forget it... Let's go, Sandy!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Please take point. I'll cover our backs.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> On it! We've got to make a diversion so the Monkey King can break out Master Tripitaka!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Right, let's bring these bandits to justice.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> That was a rather worthwhile training session, wasn't it.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Yeah, it was pretty fun! Though, I was pretty surprised when you started beating bad guys up halfway through, Suzuka-onee-san.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Since this was a training exercise, there was no need for a Tripitaka who did nothing but be protected, was there?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Our Master Tripitaka's highly capable, after all. Those bandits shouldn't have let their guard down.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I would have liked to have seen you two in action as well though, Pigsy, Sandy.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> In that case, should we continue this journey until the end?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I'm up for that! Let's keep going till we beat the Ox King!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Tsubakuro-san, Tripitaka's goal isn't to defeat the Ox King. We're traveling to Tianzhu... to India, to retreive the scriptures.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Oh, we are? Then, let's go until we get them!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> But wait, let's have Yukari-sama be the Ox King! It'll totally be worth fighting her!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> You know we can't ask Yukari-sama to do something like that.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ehhh, but you'll never know until we try asking!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> And anyway... Can they really recreate the story all the way to India?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I haven't checked, but wouldn't it be like Ban-san to have gone into that much detail?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Yeah, I'm getting excited for next time~!<br><div><iframe width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/53qQY9kGizE"></iframe></div>  </p><h2 id="renpu-summer-uniform---yomi-start-yomi-and-akira" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Renpu Summer Uniform - Yomi: Start]: Yomi and Akira</h2><p><strong>Yomi:</strong> I thought then that, someday, I wanted to be helpful to that person.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> ...<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Sorry I made you wait.
