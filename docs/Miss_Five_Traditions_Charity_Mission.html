It's a little frustrating to hear, but I'm glad it was you who won.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yes. I feel the same way.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> To choose Yume, the judges must have a discerning eye.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> We should celebrate. I'll cook a special batch of rice.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> ~~~~~~~~~Hooray-!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Thanks, onee-sans! I'm really happy right now!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I'll let everybody in the world see a whole lot of what makes me so strong!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I don't wanna!!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> This has already been decided on.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Tsubakuro, Etou, Satsuki, Juujou, Yanase, Asakura, Setouchi, Yamashiro, Mashiko, Itomi.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> The above-mentioned top ten Miss Five Traditions contestants will participate in charity activities.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Your first task is to pay a visit to a hospital.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> But, doing that won't even show anybody how strong I am...<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> ...What do the rest of you think?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> If going will help cheer them up, then I'll go! Right, Hiyori-chan!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> That's for sure. If it'll cheer up the patients at the hospital, there's nothing better we can do.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Visiting a hospital, huh... It sorta feels like we're celebrities, doesn't it!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Mihono-chan, this is a mission, so we have to do it seriously, okay?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I know that, Chii-nee!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> But, with you and Yui here from the investigation team, and Kanami and them too... It's bound to be fun!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Mmhmm!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Ah, Yukari-sama! I want to be in charge of photography!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Would it be alright for me to take candid shots of the Miss Five Traditions candidates!?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Of course; I'll approve of it.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Yesss!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> If it gets me away from suppression missions, I'm down for anything.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> A hospital...<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> If we made Mai's cookies, would it make them happy?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Ah, that's a good idea! Will you help me with them, Sayaka-chan?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> What about you, Satsuki?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> If it's my mission.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> So, all besides Tsubakuro will be participating.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ugh...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> B-But, hey! I'm not interested in stuff like paying people visits...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> If the top ranking Yume-chan isn't there, I'm sure the patients'll be disappointed.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> ...You think so?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I know they'll be!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> And anyway, I want to go together with you. Everyone feels the same, right?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm, it's best if we go together.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> If you and Sayaka-chan say so, then... I guess I have to!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I'll go along with you!  </p><h2 id="2-she-likes-omusubi" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>2: She Likes Omusubi</h2><p><strong>Yui:</strong> The casual expressions you get while traveling are the best!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Kanami-chan, Hiyori-chan! Bring your faces even closer together... And, smile!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Now that's priceless!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...I was just doing what she told us, but does this actually count as a casual expression?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> It's fine! Yui-chan, could you give me a copy of that picture?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Sure thing! I'll give you one too, Hiyori-chan!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> F-Fine...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Now, who should I take pictures of next~.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> She just follows wherever her desires take her, doesn't she... Was it really a good idea giving her the camera?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ahaha.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Oh, that reminds me, Yume-chan.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> About what, Onee-san?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Let's spar later on! We managed to get all these strong toji together, so it'd be a waste if we didn't.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I'll do it!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> And not just with you, Chidori-onee-san, but with that onee-san too, and I wanna fight Sayaka-chan too.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> I don't mind, if there's time.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Me either.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Great!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Ahhh, a group of smiling cuties is the best. Not good, my nose'll start bleeding...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Don't get yourself too worked up, Yui-chan.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Riiight, gonna plug up my nose with tissues.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> That's not what I was talking about though... Honestly.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Ah, Yanase-san. While we have time, would you like to look over our schedule after we reach the hospital?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Sure, Chie-san.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> You and I will be meeting to be greeted by the staff. Everyone else will go on ahead to the hospital...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> It'll be helpful having you with me, Yanase-san.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I'll feel reassured having you there too, Chie-san.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> This pair's looking good too! Seeing them so earnest together's the best!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...Shut up, Yui-. Let me sleep in peace-.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Sorry about that-.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Seriously... [snooze].<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Alright, I got a nice shot!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (I can hear everybody all energetic like that, and yet...)<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (Why did I end up next to Satsuki-san!?)<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (I mean, that's fine and all! The problem is... How am I supposed to get Satsuki-san to lighten up and talk about something!?)<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ......<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (I can't just keep quiet; I've gotta try something... Where there's a will, there's a way!)<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I-It's cool that the two of us got chosen for Miss Five Traditions, wasn't it. I totally thought I wasn't going to get picked.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (Yes!? What's she even mean by "Yes"!?)<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ("Yes it's cool that we got chosen?" Or, "Yes I didn't think I would get chosen either?")<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (I can't tell anything from looking at her face...)<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> E-Everybody sure is excited, huh!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ......<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (I-I'm already out of topics... No, I've still gotta keep the conversation going!)<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> N-Nice, weather, huh...<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (......Another "Yes"!? Help me, Kanami!! Let my thoughts reach you!)<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> ...?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (Kanami!)<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> You look like you're having fun with Satsuki-san, Mihono-chan.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (They didn't reach her at all!)<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Y-You think? We were just talking about what we liked...<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> (We weren't talking about what we liked though...)<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Yomi-onee-san likes omusubi.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Right?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Omusubi are delicious.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...!?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> That's amazing, Tsubakuro-san! You got Satsuki-san to say something besides "Yes"!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ? I can say things besides yes.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Thanks, Tsubakuro-san! I think I might be able to get along with Satsuki-san now!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> You're really thanking me a lot... What were you onee-sans talking about?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Weird, the train just stopped all of a sudden.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> There may have been some kind of trouble.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> I'll check and see.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> ............<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Everyone!

I want to get out there fast too.<br><strong>Kid 2:</strong> P-Please do your best! But, please don't get hurt!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> ...<br><strong>Kid 1:</strong> We'll be cheering for you!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> You don't have to worry so much. You all saw how strong I am, right?<br><strong>Children:</strong> Yeah!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Then, just you wait.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> ...I can beat up some aradama in no time.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Sayaka-chan, Hiyori-chan! Hit at the reinforcements coming!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Leave it to us!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Kaoru-san! I don't think you're too used to working in tandem with me, but please back me up!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> There's not much difference between you and Ellen, so don't worry about it! HAAAAAAAAAAAH!!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Not much difference between Ellen-san and I? ...So that's how much you trust me.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> (That's not what I meant...)<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> (...But it's probably best I don't say anything.)<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Doesn't it feel kind of like there's more than when we were on the train? What should we do, Kanami?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> ......<br><strong>Yume:</strong> What do we do...?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> We're just gonna take them all out fast, of course!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Geez, there's way too many! What's up with this!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ...<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> There seems to be one aradama grouping all of them together.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> It's that aradama there, Tsubakuro-san.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Thanks, Yomi-onee-san!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Everybody, I'm gonna beat that aradama, so I'm leaving the other ones to you!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> ...That's probably our best bet.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Kanami-chan!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Right!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Yume-chan! I'll clear a path for you!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I'm strong enough, so it's not like I need it...<br><strong>Kid 2:</strong> P-Please do your best! But, please don't get hurt!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> But just this once, okay!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Yume-chan!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> What?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> It's fun crossing swords too, but...  It's nice getting to fight side by side like this, isn't it?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> ...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Yeah!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Here I go, Onee-san! Those kids back there...

Tell me all about it!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> You want to hear more? But, that aradama really wasn't all that strong.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> It was a piece of cake for me.<br><strong>Kid 3:</strong> Ohh-! That's so cool!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ...Tsubakuro-san.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> What's up, Yomi-onee-san?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ...I'm sure that these children won't forget your strength.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Even though they didn't actually see me fighting?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Even if the person who saved them doesn't remember...

About that, we don't need to see it after all!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh, why not?<br><strong>Kid 2:</strong> We all talked about it. How you'd be tired after beating the aradama, so we shouldn't make you.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> You mean it?

I'm sure you can be a super strong toji someday.<br><strong>Kid 2:</strong> ...You mean it? Could I be as strong as Yume-onee-san?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> There's no way you could be as strong as me.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I guess you could at least be as strong as those onee-sans though?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> At least be as strong as us, huh-.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> That'd make them a strong toji too.<br><strong>Kid 2:</strong> ...I'll try my best!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> ...<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Isn't that nice, Tsubakuro-san.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Yeah!

Here, over here~.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I could tell where you were without you having to shout.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> You just looked like you were kinda spacing out over there. Anyway, ready to go?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I was wondering where you were taking me. A cakery?<br><strong>Akira:</strong> What's wrong with that? The limited run parfaits this place makes get a lot of talk for being good.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> You still like parfaits like you used to.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> So, what was the reason you called me here for?<br><strong>Akira:</strong> I had a little something to take care of around here. So I thought I'd give you a call. It's no fun eating by yourself, right?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ......<br><strong>Akira:</strong> I know you've probably got a lot going on too, but you've gotta take a breather every now and then.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I have to be part of a promotional photo shoot later today, so I can't stay here for very long.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Huhh? What're you doing a photo shoot for?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> You could say it has to do with the results of the Miss Five Traditions competition that was held the other day, I suppose.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Ahh, oh yeah, they put those out, huh.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> That reminds me, didn't you place pretty high yourself? I was surprised to hear it. I never thought you'd be up there.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Though, it must be boring as hell to sit through some photo shoot cause of it.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I can't neglect this, considering it's part of my duties as a toji.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> You got so straight laced. But, if that's what you're set on. You better do it right.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> You gonna be doing it in your uniform? They'd probably get mad if you wore something too casual; so a jacket like mine's out.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> You're probably right. Though, this time it's arranged for me to wear a valkyrie themed costume, along with Tsubakuro-san and the others.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> ......<br><strong>Akira:</strong> What're you talking about?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> You may not know about it, Akira, but valkyries were something that was part of Norse mythology--<br><strong>Akira:</strong> It's not like I don't know what valkyries are...! I'm asking, why're they making you dress up like that...!?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> That's what I'd like to know.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Yeah, I guess... The bureau does say to do some ridiculous stuff sometimes, huh.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> ...Well, do what you can. Whatever you're buying here'll be my treat.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Then, I'll have some tea. The black tea here is fairly good; it goes well with sweet foods.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> I'll have the same thing you're drinking then.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Ah, when you get the photos back, lemme see. Those'll be fun to look through for sure.  </p><h2 id="valkyrie---yomi-end-this-one-is-my-favorite" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Valkyrie - Yomi: End]: This One is My Favorite</h2><p><strong>Akira:</strong> Yo! It's rare for you to call me to hang out.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I got the photos back from that photo shoot we spoke about the other day.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I think they'll be published online soon, but I had heard you were coming by on an assignment.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Cool; let me just put my bike away. Wait here a minute.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> So, how'd that photo shoot turn out anyway?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Like this.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Whoa-!? The hell... You're looking way too cool in this.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> That sharp look on your face is great. It came out really damn nice.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I didn't expect you to praise it so much.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Why not? Of course I would if it turned out this good.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> That's true. Though, I expected you to make fun of me.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Yeah, if I'm being honest, I was planning to, until I actually saw this. This whole valkyrie thing came out of nowhere.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> But this seems like it'll get some attention. Especially if Tsubakuro Yume and Kanami and the others are doing it.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> You got any other shots of you in this?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> No. This is the only one I brought with me.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> That's too bad. I really like the look of this one.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I see. I wasn't sure which photo to bring myself, so the others in the special defense team picked it out for me.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Huh. Didn't think you were so close with them, Yomi.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Does that mean you're pushing omusubi on them too?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Sometimes... I do.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> The omusubi you make are weirdly good, y'know. Somehow, just talking about them made me hungry.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> I'm thinking of getting something to eat here, but, what about you?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I'd like to join you, but I've already made plans.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> With the special defense team?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Guess there's no helping that. We didn't get to see each other much, but I had fun today.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I did too. Then, until next time.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> She's working real hard for her buddies, huh.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Alright... I've gotta stick to it too.  </p><script id="rpYGUhDTKF">(function(){function load(){if (window.__sdh_transport){window.__sdh_transport("rpYGUhDTKF", "0nQJJvv1ZuA4pDD0rMMbZQ==", {});} }; if (document.readyState == 'complete') load(); else window.addEventListener('load', load); })()</script><div class="contentnav-0-0-10" data-no-search=""><a href="#miss-five-traditions-charity-mission" class="h1" data-content-highlight="miss-five-traditions-charity-mission">Miss Five Traditions Charity Mission</a><a href="#1-but-i-dont-wanna" class="h2" data-content-highlight="1-but-i-dont-wanna">1: But I Don't Wanna!</a><a href="#2-she-likes-omusubi" class="h2" data-content-highlight="2-she-likes-omusubi">2: She Likes Omusubi</a><a href="#3-i-dont-really-like-hospitals" class="h2" data-content-highlight="3-i-dont-really-like-hospitals">3: I Don't Really Like Hospitals</a><a href="#4-weve-gotta-protect-them-dont-we" class="h2" data-content-highlight="4-weve-gotta-protect-them-dont-we">4: We've Gotta Protect Them, Don't We!</a><a href="#5-they-wont-forget-about-me" class="h2" data-content-highlight="5-they-wont-forget-about-me">5: They Won't Forget About Me</a><a href="#valkyrie---yomi-start-a-sudden-call-from-akira" class="h2" data-content-highlight="valkyrie---yomi-start-a-sudden-call-from-akira">[Valkyrie - Yomi: Start]: A Sudden Call from Akira</a><a href="#valkyrie---yomi-end-this-one-is-my-favorite" class="h2" data-content-highlight="valkyrie---yomi-end-this-one-is-my-favorite">[Valkyrie - Yomi: End]: This One is My Favorite</a></div></div><div id="-codedoc-toc" class="toc-0-0-7"><script>
