<strong>Nanoha:</strong> Have you heard about our next job yet?<br>
<strong>Fate:</strong> Mmhm, I heard, Nanoha.<br>
<strong>Fate:</strong> We&#x27;re going to an Earth in a different world to recover a Lost Logia.<br>
<strong>Hayate:</strong> Sounds like they don&#x27;t have magic technology there, but they said they have these people called toji.<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong> Ah, that was in the data I got. They&#x27;re defenders of justice, who protect everyone with okatana!<br>
<strong>Fate:</strong> They sound almost like samurai, don&#x27;t they?<br>
<strong>Hayate:</strong> Sure do. If Signum was coming along, she&#x27;d probably want to go and spar with them.<br>
<strong>Fate:</strong> That does sound like something Signum would say.<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong> Toji... I wonder what they&#x27;re like. I&#x27;m excited to meet them!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="2-are-aradama-something-scary-1-days-until-the-collab-event"></a>2: Are Aradama Something Scary? ~1 Days Until the Collab Event~<a class="hash-link" href="#2-are-aradama-something-scary-1-days-until-the-collab-event" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Nanoha:</strong> By the way, have you two heard any details about this Lost Logia?<br>
<strong>Hayate:</strong> I only heard the name. They said it&#x27;s an &quot;Akabane Sword&quot;.<br>
<strong>Fate:</strong> Me too.<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong> Oh well. In that case, we&#x27;ll just have to pick up more information where we get there.<br>
<strong>Fate:</strong> I&#x27;d like to recover it before anyone can get hurt.<br>
<strong>Hayate:</strong> That&#x27;s for sure.<br>
<strong>Hayate:</strong> Though, we&#x27;d better watch out too. From the sound of it, there&#x27;s these nasty things called &quot;aradama&quot; in the Earth we&#x27;re going to.<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong> Since the toji eliminate aradama, does that mean they&#x27;re some kind of monster?<br>
<strong>Fate:</strong> It looks like they sent us pictures too, Nanoha.<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong> So that&#x27;s an aradama...<br>
<strong>Fate:</strong> Ah, there&#x27;s people there fighting the aradama. Are they the toji?<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong> They look a little older than us... I think?<br>
<strong>Hayate:</strong> So that&#x27;s how they fight against aradama. They&#x27;re kinda cool, huh.<br>
<strong>Hayate:</strong> Well, I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll have to fight against aradama ourselves, but we should be careful just to be sure.<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong> Sure thing, Hayate-chan!<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong> So then... Let&#x27;s go!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="1-the-doppelganger-rumors"></a>1: The Doppelganger Rumors<a class="hash-link" href="#1-the-doppelganger-rumors" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> By the way, have you heard the rumors about the doppelgangers?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Doppelgangers?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> It means somebody who&#x27;s exactly like you, Sayaka-chan.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> There&#x27;s rumors about that?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> There are! In fact, there&#x27;s a rumor going around the Five Traditions about people&#x27;s doppelganger&#x27;s showing up!!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...There&#x27;s people who look exactly the same showing up?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Sounds like it!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I heard, sometime before Halloween, people were saying &quot;I ran into myself!&quot; and stuff like that.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> At first it felt like, since Halloween was coming up, they must spreading around as some kind of prank.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> But, even after Halloween, it didn&#x27;t go away, and there&#x27;s more and more people saying they saw their doppleganger!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...Did you two see your dopplegangers?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I wish, but I don&#x27;t think so.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> If I had my doppleganger, we could spar with each other anywhere anytime!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I can see you doing that, Etou-san.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I haven&#x27;t seen mine either. But... I don&#x27;t think I want to meet them.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Wouldn&#x27;t it be a little scary, meeting someone exactly like you?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> It&#x27;s scary?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Mmhm, for me at least. Would you want to meet someone just like you, Itomi-san?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...I don&#x27;t know. But...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> But... what?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> If there were two Mais, there could be so many cookies it would be bad.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Two Mai-chans making cookies... It&#x27;d be all you can eat.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> If that happens, I&#x27;ll share with everyone.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> What about you, Suu?<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Ah, I&#x27;m good.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Eh?<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Err, I mean! Uhh, uhh...<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> (I know she said to treat her normal, but Sayaka-chan is Renpu&#x27;s deadly professional!)		[Suu calls Sayaka &#x27;Hissatsu Shigotonin&#x27;, a reference to a famous period drama about an assassin for hire]<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> (I really am kind of bad at dealing with her... I&#x27;ll just try not to offend her here...)<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Talking about doppelgangers, it&#x27;s like that, right? How, you meet three people just like you, and they might try to sue.		[There is a very lame pun here about how, if you meet &quot;au to&quot; 3 people just like you, you&#x27;re out &quot;au to&quot;]<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Get it?<br>
<strong>Kanami/Sayaka/Kiyoka:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Haha, hahaha...<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> (C-Crap! Now I went and froze the room over!)<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> If you meet three people just like you, they&#x27;ll sue?<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Please, I&#x27;m begging you, don&#x27;t bring it back up. It&#x27;s just something that popped into my headdd!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Inami-san... I don&#x27;t that one works...<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Just let it gooo!!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Our phones... All four of us at once?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That&#x27;s got to be a mission... right? Do you think we&#x27;re all on the same mission?<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> (Ah, that means it should be easy!)<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...It&#x27;s an Akabane sword recovery mission, with the members here and Satsuki Yomi.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Eh, with Satsuki-san...?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Is something wrong, Inami-san?<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> No... It&#x27;s just, I&#x27;m sort of avoiding doing a little training with Satsuki-san...<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> (I ran away from this week&#x27;s utsushi increasing program again...)<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I think it&#x27;d be better if you made sure to do your training though.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> I guess so...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Then, while we&#x27;re on this mission, you can apologize to Satsuki-san and tell her you&#x27;ll make sure to show up to your training!<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Wait, that&#x27;s a little... Hey, don&#x27;t drag me with youuu!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I see a response on the spectrum finder.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> There&#x27;s a high probability that aradama will be in the area surrounding the Akabane sword. All members, please be on guard.<br>
<strong>Everyone:</strong> Right!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> The signal vanished? All members, please confirm on your spectrum finders.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> It&#x27;s... gone.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You&#x27;re right... What do you think happened?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Maybe somebody beat the aradama? If the signal disappeared, that&#x27;s all it could be, right?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Is there a different unit here too?<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Did they double book? Then, that means we can leave it all to that unit and go back home!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> If that is the case, the other unit will be responsible for suppressing the aradama while we hurry to recover the Akabane sword.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Great!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> We&#x27;ll go confirm at the scene. All members, please apply utsushi.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ...We&#x27;re moving.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> It&#x27;s a good thing we&#x27;ll finish this mission smoothly, huh!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> ...What are you making that face for, Kiyoka-san?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I just have a bit of a bad feeling about this...<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> D-Don&#x27;t go raising flags like that. You&#x27;re spooking me out of nowhere...<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...I wish Mai were here.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I know what you mean. It&#x27;d be a real relief having Mai with us, since she can use myougan.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...Mm.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> ...Eh? Is there actually something here...?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Please put an end to the chatter. ...I can see something.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Is that Hono-chan, Chie-san, and Yui-chan?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> It is them.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Thank goodness... Everyone was looking so serious, I was getting worried.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Did the investigation team have an Akabane sword recovery mission?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> We didn&#x27;t... I never heard about one...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Hey, Hono-cha...<br>

<strong>Kanami:</strong> I don&#x27;t really get what&#x27;s going on, but... we have to stop that girl!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mihono! Chie! Yui!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> We&#x27;ll save you... right away!<br>
<strong>??? (Fate):</strong> I won&#x27;t let you!!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> !? Where&#x27;d she come from...!?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Watch out! Sayaka-chan!<br>
<strong>??? (Fate):</strong> --!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Are you okay?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm... Thank you, Kanami.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> When did that girl get in front of Sayaka-san...? Was she using jin&#x27;i?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> A sword made of light...? That doesn&#x27;t look like an okatana...<br>
<strong>??? (Hayate):</strong> Who&#x27;d have thought backup would get here so quick. Nanoha-chan!<br>
<strong>??? (Nanoha):</strong> Got it! Divine... Shooter!<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> She&#x27;s shooting something!?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> All members, intercept fire.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Intercept... Wait, can we even cut that with okatana!?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> We&#x27;ll just have to find out!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Chidori can even cut through lightning, so... Even if I don&#x27;t really get what this stuff is, it should be able to cut it too!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!<br>
<strong>???:</strong> (What if...)<br>
<strong>???:</strong> DON&#x27;T!!<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> It missed?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...No. They fired away at the last second.<br>
<strong>??? (Fate):</strong> Nanoha? What&#x27;s wrong?<br>
<strong>??? (Nanoha):</strong> Fate-chan, Hayate-chan. I&#x27;m sure these girls are different.<br>
<strong>??? (Hayate):</strong> You say that, but... Didn&#x27;t they come just in time to back up the rest?<br>
<strong>??? (Nanoha):</strong> Still, I think they&#x27;re different.<br>
<strong>??? (Hayate):</strong> Well, I guess you&#x27;re right they don&#x27;t feel the same as the ones we&#x27;ve been fighting so far...<br>
<strong>??? (Nanoha):</strong> See! So... Let&#x27;s talk this over.<br>
<strong>??? (Hayate):</strong> That&#x27;s just like you, Nanoha-chan. What about you, Fate-chan?<br>
<strong>??? (Fate):</strong> ...I think it&#x27;s fine. I trust Nanoha.<br>
<strong>??? (Nanoha):</strong> Thanks, Fate-chan!<br>
<strong>??? (Nanoha):</strong> So then... We&#x27;re sorry we attacked you! It might be a little late, but we&#x27;d like to talk with you!<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> They want to talk...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...What do we do?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Let&#x27;s hear them out.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> When I crossed swords with that blonde girl... I didn&#x27;t get the feeling she was a bad person.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> So we should try talking with them first.<br>
<strong>Suu/Kiyoka:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Look close, listen well, trust your instincts... And we can decide from there.<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong> My name is Takamachi Nanoha. And, these two are...<br>
<strong>Fate:</strong> Fate T. Harlaown.<br>
<strong>Hayate:</strong> I&#x27;m Yagami Hayate.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> So, Nanoha-chan, Fate-chan, and Hayate-chan.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> You can explain all this to us, right? Like, what that power was you attacked us with...<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong> That was magic.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Magic...? You mean like, the kind in games and stories?<br>
<strong>Hayate:</strong> You can think of it like that. We&#x27;re contract mages from the Time-Space Administrative Bureau, and we came here from another Earth.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Magic and mages and another Earth? S-She suddenly threw out a bunch of fantasy stuff...<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> But, I don&#x27;t feel like they&#x27;re lying.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> ...Same.<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong> The reason we came to this Earth was to investigate something. We detected a strange reading, and...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Why did you attack Hono-chan and them?<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong> That&#x27;s because... Earlier, those girls came attacking us, so we only fought back in self-defense.<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong> And... Uhh. Er, could you tell us your names?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Oh, I&#x27;m Etou Kanami. And, going around, this is Itomi Sayaka-chan, Musumi Kiyoka-san, Inami Suu-chan, and Satsuki Yomi-san.<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong> Thank you very much, Kanami-san.<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong> And we thought you were with them, Kanami-san, so we fought you too... But you seemed sort of different... Ah!<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong> We used a non-lethal setting, so, while they&#x27;re unconscious, those girls shouldn&#x27;t be hurt or anything!<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Non-lethal setting... So magic can do stuff like that...<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ...I&#x27;ll check on Asakura-san and the others. If they&#x27;re only unconscious, I&#x27;ll take that into consideration.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Musumi-san, please come with me.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah, right!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Oh, I&#x27;ll go too!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> You know... why were Mihono-chan and them here in the first place?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I&#x27;m not sure. They&#x27;re supposed to be away on an expedition right about now... Huh?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That okatana... That&#x27;s not Kashuu Kiyomitsu.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> This is an Akabane sword.<br>
<strong>Mihono?:</strong> --!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> KYAA!?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> This person... They&#x27;re not Hono-chan! It&#x27;s an aradama!<br>
<strong>Mimic Aradama:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Watch out!<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> EEP!?<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> (Even though it looked like Mihono-san... She didn&#x27;t even hesitate to chop it down!)<br>
<strong>Mimic Aradama:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ...Setouchi-san and Yamashiro-san are aradama as well.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> --!!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ...You mentioned a strange reading. Did it have to do with these aradama?<br>
<strong>Hayate:</strong> We&#x27;re still investigating, so we don&#x27;t know.<br>
<strong>Fate:</strong> Are aradama like this rare?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Aradama that can mimic a person this closely are definitely rare.<br>
<strong>Fate:</strong> Then... I can&#x27;t say for sure, but it&#x27;s probably connected.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ...Have you all heard the rumors about doppelgangers?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah, we have.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Currently, the Special Defense Team has had considerable reports of damage caused by these doppelgangers.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> We still don&#x27;t know what is causing this situation.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> If the doppelgangers are actually mimic aradama, we have to solve this right away!<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong> Um... Please let us work with you!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Huh?<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong> The reason we came to this world was to prevent a crisis that might happen!<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong> Even if it&#x27;s not our world, I don&#x27;t want to see people in trouble, or sad, or crying... I want to rescue them! We want to help you!<br>
<strong>Fate/Hayate:</strong> Please let us!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I think it&#x27;s fine.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> We&#x27;ll need Nanoha-chan, Fate-chan, and Hayate-chan&#x27;s help to get to the bottom of this mission.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ...Very well then.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> First, I&#x27;ll make a report to the Sword Administration Bureau. Once that&#x27;s finished, we&#x27;ll begin taking action.<br>
<strong>Nanoha/Fate/Hayate:</strong> Thank you very much!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> This is Satsuki Yomi, of the Special Defense Team. I&#x27;ve identified the true form of these doppelgangers to be aradama.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Their disguises are fairly sophisticated, so it&#x27;s likely they will be mistaken for the real person. If any toji are behaving strangely... Eh?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ...Yes.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> What&#x27;s wrong?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> It seems that Ban-san, Kitora-san, and Tsubakuro-san have all taken out Akabane swords.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="3-a-promise-for-after-were-done"></a>3: A Promise for After We&#x27;re Done<a class="hash-link" href="#3-a-promise-for-after-were-done" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Kanami:</strong> It was really shocking, seeing aradama mimic Mihono-chan and them.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Yeah...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Even more than when we fought mimic aradama before... This Mihono-chan felt more like a person to me.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah... maybe you&#x27;re right. The mimic aradama back then were more like monsters than this...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I don&#x27;t really want to remember it... That was traumatizing...<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> If she didn&#x27;t have an Akabane sword, would you have realized it?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> N-No. That&#x27;s how much it seemed like the real thing.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Nanoha, Fate, Hayate. What was it like fighting Mihono and them?<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong> I don&#x27;t know much about swordfighting styles and that kind of thing, but they were using their swords properly.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> If it&#x27;s enough for there to be rumors about them, the doppelgangers are probably pretty close to the real person, right?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Do you think there&#x27;s aradama mimicking us too?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Who can say? We don&#x27;t know what basis is causing mimic aradama to show up...<br>
<strong>Fate:</strong> We&#x27;ve fought several mimic aradama so far, but none of them looked like any of you.<br>
<strong>Hayate:</strong> Oh yeah, Nanoha-chan! We&#x27;d better hand those over to the toji.<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong> Ah! These are Akabane swords we took from mimic aradama we fought before.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I&#x27;ll hold onto them.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Though... why did you recover their Akabane swords?<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong> We thought that maybe it was these swords... the Akabane swords that were causing the toji to act strangely...<br>
<strong>Fate:</strong> Though, it was them being mimic aradama that was strange, so our assumption was off...<br>
<strong>Hayate:</strong> Ah! We just left the mimic aradama like they were too!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Without an okatana, you won&#x27;t be able to suppress aradama. I believe that should still be the case for magic.<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong> So we can&#x27;t beat them with magic...<br>
<strong>Hayate:</strong> ...Though, something comes to mind.<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong> Fate-chan, Hayate-chan.<br>
<strong>Fate:</strong> Right.<br>
<strong>Hayate:</strong> Yeah, we&#x27;d better prepare just in case.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> If you use magic to cover for us, there won&#x27;t be any issues. We&#x27;ll dispose of the mimic aradama.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Hey, Nanoha-chan, Fate-chan, Hayate-chan. Tell me what it was like fighting toji.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I want to know how it felt for a magical girl.<br>
<strong>Fate:</strong> The first that comes to mind is... They were hard to fight.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Hard to fight?<br>
<strong>Fate:</strong> They would grow fast, powerful, and tough... You can&#x27;t let your guard down fighting someone capable at swordfighting.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That would be jin&#x27;i, hachimanriki, and kongoushin.<br>
<strong>Fate:</strong> Also, I don&#x27;t get many chances to fight with people who know real swordfighting, so I learned lots from it!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Well then, once this is over, let&#x27;s spar together! The way you were moving before got me interested, Fate-chan!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> I&#x27;m interested too. I want to try fighting seriously with Fate.<br>
<strong>Fate:</strong> The pleasure would be all mine!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> What about you two, Nanoha-chan, Hayate-chan?<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong> I think I&#x27;ll... hold off. I&#x27;m not so good with close quarters combat...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> It didn&#x27;t really look that way to me though...<br>
<strong>Hayate:</strong> I&#x27;ll pass on that too. Signum would&#x27;ve been happy to, but... Ah, Signum&#x27;s from my family; she&#x27;s a swordfighter.<br>
<strong>Fate:</strong> She&#x27;s a very powerful knight.<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong> You&#x27;re right, she probably would love to fight with the toji.<br>
<strong>Fate:</strong> Will you be joining us, Kiyoka-san, Suu-san?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Sure, if you&#x27;ll have me.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> I&#x27;ll stay out of it by any means necessary! Cause there&#x27;s no way I could handle that!!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Please leave any sparring until after this case is resolved.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Got it! Let&#x27;s work hard at this, Fate-chan!<br>
<strong>Fate:</strong> Of course, Kanami-san!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="4-meeting-the-aradama"></a>4: Meeting the Aradama<a class="hash-link" href="#4-meeting-the-aradama" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Yomi:</strong> It seems that Ban-san, Kitora-san, and Tsubakuro-san have all taken out Akabane swords.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> If it were just Tsugumi-san and Mirja-san, I could understand it... But Tsubakuro-san being in there feels wrong.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> There&#x27;s no doubt those three are mimic aradama.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Since they&#x27;ve taken Akabane swords, we can&#x27;t ignore them. We&#x27;ll go take care of this.<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong> What should we do?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> We&#x27;ll split into three teams.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> First... Etou-san and Takamachi-san.<br>
<strong>Kanami/Nanoha:</strong> Yes!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Please go after Ban-san.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Understood. I&#x27;m with you, Nanoha-chan!<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong> Okay, Kanami-san!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Next... Musumi-san and Harlaown-san.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka/Fate:</strong> Yes.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> The three of us, with me included, will go after Kitora-san.<br>
<strong>Fate:</strong> I&#x27;ll be in your care, Yomi-san, Kiyoka-san.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Mmhm! Let&#x27;s do our best together, Fate-chan!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Lastly...<br>
<strong>Hayate:</strong> Me, Sayaka-san, and Suu-san are going after this Tsubakuro-san person, right!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes, please do.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Wait, hang on a minute! Why do I have to fight Tsubakuro-sama!?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I&#x27;d have Itomi-san handle Tsubakuro-san. Inami-san, please give Itomi-san your support.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...Mm, I&#x27;ll beat Tsubakuro Yume.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> There&#x27;s no way I can do this!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> You should be fine.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> What gives you that idea!?<br>
<strong>Hayate:</strong> Hey now. Let&#x27;s just give it our best shot, Suu-san.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Hayate-chan... Actually, it&#x27;s hard to tell which of us is older here...<br>
<strong>Hayate:</strong> You think so? Doesn&#x27;t seem that way to me.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> With that, all members, please head towards your targets.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Found you... Ban-san!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi?:</strong> Oh? What&#x27;s wrong, Etou-san? That girl with you, is she lost?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> No, she&#x27;s not lost... Wait... Ban-san...?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi?:</strong> Yes? Do you see anyone besides me here?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I don&#x27;t...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> (This is just like talking to the real Ban-san...)<br>
<strong>Tsugumi?:</strong> If you don&#x27;t need anything from me, could I leave? I&#x27;m in a bit of a hurry.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> (She&#x27;s just like the real thing. If I didn&#x27;t know any better, I&#x27;d be fooled for sure.)<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong> ...Kanami-san, please be careful.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Don&#x27;t worry, Nanoha-chan. I was just surprised at how similar it is to the real thing.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi?:</strong> Ah-, did you just come to chat? Then you&#x27;re in my way.<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong> What is it you&#x27;re after? Why did you take an Akabane sword?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi Mimic:</strong>  ......So you figured it all out. Because of this girl?<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong> Please give us the Akabane sword.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I refuse. This is something we need.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Though... Against Etou-san, I won&#x27;t have a chance. There&#x27;s no other way around it; I&#x27;ll have to call for help.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Help?<br>
<strong>Mimic Aradama:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Please handle them-.<br>
<strong>Mimic Aradama:</strong> --!<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong> Kanami-san!<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong> I&#x27;ll stop the aradama from moving with Bind! That&#x27;s your chance!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Leave it to me!<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong> Here goes... Bind!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Gh, my body won&#x27;t move!? What is this...!<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong> Now!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Kh, for this to...<br>
<strong>NAnoha:</strong> We did it, Kanami-san! Now for the rest of the aradama...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I already beat them.<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong> Already!?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I did have you backing me up.<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong> I didn&#x27;t know you were that powerful, Kanami-san...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Thanks for the compliment! But, so long as I have your help, I&#x27;m as strong as a hundred people!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Anyway, we got the Akabane sword, though... what do you think she was going to do with it...?<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong> We probably should have asked before we beat her.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> ...Ah.<br>
<strong>Fate:</strong> YAAAAAAAAHH!!<br>
<strong>Mirja Mimic:</strong> What is that speed!?<br>
<strong>Fate:</strong> Kiyoka-san!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Right!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!<br>
<strong>Mirja Mimic:</strong> Krh, Musumi Kiyokaaa!!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...Don&#x27;t call my name!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> The real Mirja-san... is much more impressive than you!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Ggh...!?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> It&#x27;s over.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Why did you withdraw an Akabane sword?<br>
<strong>Mirja Mimic:</strong> I was only following orders! I have nothing more to say!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Is that so.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> -!!<br>
<strong>Mirja Mimic:</strong> Gh...<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Suppression complete.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Musumi-san, please recover the Akabane sword.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> R-Right!<br>
<strong>Fate:</strong> I&#x27;ll help you.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Thank you. You know... You&#x27;re incredible, Fate-chan.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Going around with that flash of yellow light... It&#x27;s like seeing lightning.<br>
<strong>Fate:</strong> Thank you very much.<br>
<strong>Fate:</strong> Though, you move quite quickly yourself, Kiyoka-san... You were strong.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That&#x27;s... all thanks to Mirja-san and everyone.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I used to be useless and scared of aradama, but I only grew past it thanks to the investigation team.<br>
<strong>Fate:</strong> ...Did you find it hard fighting against someone who looked the same as this Mirja person?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> If I&#x27;m honest... A little.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Musumi-san, Harlaown-san. There&#x27;s someone giving orders to the mimic aradama to take Akabane swords.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I&#x27;m going to report to the Sword Administration Bureau, so please wait a moment.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Alright.<br>
<strong>Fate:</strong> I&#x27;ll pass this on to Nanoha and Hayate too.<br>

<strong>Suu:</strong> ...Honestly, we might be in a pinch here.<br>
<strong>Hayate:</strong> Sorry, I wish I could back you up a little better...<br>
<strong>Hayate:</strong> I&#x27;m no good with magic that takes fine control...<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Sure... Wait, fine control? Does that mean you&#x27;re good at magic you don&#x27;t have to control?<br>
<strong>Hayate:</strong> That&#x27;s how it goes.<br>
<strong>Hayate:</strong> But, if I used that, you&#x27;d get caught up in it.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Then, let&#x27;s go with that!<br>
<strong>Hayate:</strong> With that?<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Yeah! I&#x27;m just guessing, but I can probably use utsushi two or three more times... So getting hit with friendly fire&#x27;s no problem!<br>

<strong>Suu:</strong> Of course I&#x27;m not okay with it!<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> But... It&#x27;s not just you, Hayate-chan... Nanoha-chan and Fate-chan too. All these girls even younger than me are trying so hard.<br>

<strong>Suu:</strong> So... I&#x27;ll be the bait, so fire away!<br>
<strong>Hayate:</strong> Just one thing... You&#x27;re not thinking of sacrificing yourself, are you?<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> I haven&#x27;t thought that for a second!<br>
<strong>Hayate:</strong> ...Then, let&#x27;s do it.<br>
<strong>Hayate:</strong> I&#x27;m counting on you to round them up, Suu-san!<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Just watch me! If you&#x27;re only looking for the best punching bag, I&#x27;m the number one toji!<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Please make it quick, while I still have utsushi up!<br>

<strong>Nanoha:</strong> We&#x27;re waiting for you!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Since you&#x27;re not holding a phone, was that magic just now?<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong> Yes, Kanami-san.<br>

<strong>Nanoha:</strong> Fate-chan! Hayate-chan!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Satsuki-san, what do we do from here?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> We&#x27;re going to the location where Ban-san and the other fake toji announced they would be taking the Akabane swords for testing.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...What if it&#x27;s a trap?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> It&#x27;s possible, but we have no other leads.<br>

<strong>Suu:</strong> About that... I&#x27;m going to have to quit here.<br>

<strong>Magical Girls:</strong> Sure thing!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="1-im-not-lettin-that-go"></a>1: I&#x27;m Not Lettin&#x27; That Go<a class="hash-link" href="#1-im-not-lettin-that-go" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Yomi:</strong> ...There are no longer signs of aradama in this location either. Takamachi-san, was there anything you found suspicious?<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong> No, it looks alright to me.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Okay, we&#x27;re done here-. &quot;No issues in this location either&quot;, there.<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong> Uh...<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong> Th-That&#x27;s right, Tsugumi-san...<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> What&#x27;s wrong, Takamachi-san?<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong> Actually, this is the place where I fought your mimic aradama with Kanami-san...<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Is that what happened?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Even if it was just like me, an aradama is an aradama. Don&#x27;t let it bother you.<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong> I know that, but, it really was just like you...<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Did it resemble me that closely? Hmm, I would like to have been there then. What a shame.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ...Let&#x27;s put an end to this conversation and head back. Sanae-san and Harlaown-san, and Akira and Yagami-san, should be returning from investigating the other locations now.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Yomi! What&#x27;s the deal with this brat!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Akira?<br>
<strong>Fate:</strong> Did you do something with Akira-san, Hayate?<br>
<strong>Hayate:</strong> Y&#x27;see, Akira-san looks like she&#x27;s really packing, so I just wanted to see if I could check...<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> No shit I wasn&#x27;t gonna let you!<br>
<strong>Hayate:</strong> And it went like this.<br>
<strong>Fate:</strong> Ahaha...<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Satsuki-san. About the location I went to with Fate-san, there were no signs of aradama there.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> It didn&#x27;t seem like Fate-san was able to pick up anything especially strange there either.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Understood. What about you, Akira?<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> ...Tch. It was the same for us; there&#x27;s nothing there.<br>
<strong>Fate:</strong> Hm? By the way... What happened to Nanoha? Wasn&#x27;t she with you two, Yomi-san, Tsugumi-san?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Takamachi-san should be back any minute. She was going to get something...<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong> Ah, you already met up! Welcome back, Fate-chan, Hayate-chan.<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong> ...Though, is it weird for me to say that when I&#x27;m the last one here?<br>
<strong>Fate:</strong> Probably.<br>
<strong>Fate:</strong> Welcome back, Nanoha.<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong> Yeah. I&#x27;m back, Fate-chan.<br>
<strong>Hayate:</strong> Tsugumi-san said you were getting something, so I guess that&#x27;s it.<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong> Yep!<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong> Um, I wanted to offer you cakes! Let&#x27;s all eat them together!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Cakes?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> ...They looks delicious.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> I know. And so adorable too. Since you went and got them for us, I&#x27;ll have one...<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Ah, it&#x27;s tasty.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Aren&#x27;t you going to eat, Akira? You...<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Shut up, Yomi.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> (Damnit, there&#x27;s no way I could eat cakes that look this cute!)<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> (But it&#x27;d be such a waste if I don&#x27;t... Okay. How do I go about eating one?)<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> (Ahh, crap. I can&#x27;t stop smiling.)<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong> ...Um, Akira-san. Do you maybe not like cake?<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Huh?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> No, Akira...<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Didn&#x27;t I tell you to shut it!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> ...It&#x27;s not like I hate it. It&#x27;s just, sorta... y&#x27;know.<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong> ?<br>
<strong>Fate:</strong> What&#x27;s the matter?<br>
<strong>Hayate:</strong> ...Ah.<br>
<strong>Hayate:</strong> We weren&#x27;t together all that long, but I can tell Akira-san&#x27;s trying to look cool.<br>
<strong>Fate:</strong> She wants to look cool?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ah-! You look like you&#x27;re eating something yummy! Lucky-! Gimme some!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Do you want to have mine?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> You already ate half of yours, Yomi-onee-san. So if that onee-san&#x27;s not gonna have hers, I&#x27;ll take it-.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Huh? What&#x27;re you talking about...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> You&#x27;re the only one who doesn&#x27;t look like she&#x27;s gonna eat, so it&#x27;s fine, right?<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Hahh!?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> [om nom]... Mm, so good!<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> A-Ahh......<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> ...You&#x27;re gonna pay for that.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> I&#x27;m not letting this one go.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> I&#x27;m gonna teach you a lesson, Tsubakuro Yume!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh!?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> (...Because Akira loves cakes.)  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="2-playing-tag"></a>2: Playing Tag<a class="hash-link" href="#2-playing-tag" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Akira:</strong> Let&#x27;s take this outside, Tsubakuro Yume!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> ...Aha.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> That means we&#x27;re going to fight, right? You sure?<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Hah?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Onee-san, you know you&#x27;re going to lose?<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Come try me then!<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Hold on a minute! Don&#x27;t you think that&#x27;s going too far over a piece of cake!<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Doesn&#x27;t matter how big or small what she did is, Sanae.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> The point is, she did something she shouldn&#x27;t. So I&#x27;m gonna teach her a lesson.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> That&#x27;s all there is to it. You get that, right?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I don&#x27;t really get what lesson you&#x27;re going to teach me, but this seems fun so I&#x27;m fine with it.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Just hang on a minute!<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Here, look! See how troubled you&#x27;re making Takamachi-san after she brought the cake for us!<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong> Uhh...<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> That&#x27;s... Well, I guess you&#x27;ve got a point.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ah! I know about this cause I made sure to read the report!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Nanoha-chan, Fate-chan, Hayate-chan. You&#x27;re all really strong, right?<br>
<strong>Fate:</strong> She&#x27;s looking at us like she wants to fight us... isn&#x27;t she.<br>
<strong>Hayate:</strong> (You&#x27;re probably wanting to fight yourself though, Fate-chan...<br>
<strong>Hayate:</strong> What are you going to do, Fate-chan?<br>
<strong>Fate:</strong> ...I think I&#x27;m interested.<br>
<strong>Hayate:</strong> Okay, in that case...<br>
<strong>Hayate:</strong> (Hey, Nanoha-chan, Fate-chan.)<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong> (What is it, Hayate-chan?)<br>
<strong>Fate:</strong> (What do you have in mind?)<br>
<strong>Hayate:</strong> (What do you think of this? See...)<br>
<strong>Hayate:</strong> (Something like that.)<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong> (Good thinking, Hayate-chan! That&#x27;s a nice idea!)<br>
<strong>Fate:</strong> (Yeah, let&#x27;s go with that.)<br>
<strong>Hayate:</strong> (Then it&#x27;s settled.)<br>
<strong>Hayate:</strong> Anyway, if that&#x27;s how it is, what do you say we decide this with a game of tag?<br>
<strong>Akira/Yume:</strong> Tag?<br>
<strong>Hayate:</strong> Alright, so I&#x27;ll explain the rules.<br>
<strong>Hayate:</strong> It&#x27;s pretty simple.<br>
<strong>Hayate:</strong> We&#x27;ll split into two teams: Nanoha-chan, Yume-san, and Tsugumi-san, and Akira-san, Sanae-san, and me. First team to catch Fate-chan, who&#x27;s it, wins.<br>
<strong>Hayate:</strong> Fate-chan&#x27;s gonna run with all she&#x27;s got, so do all you can to get her!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> If we can do all we can, that means we can fight, right?<br>
<strong>Hayate:</strong> Sure. Fate-chan&#x27;s tough.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Hmm, sounds neat. I&#x27;ll be fighting Fate-chan, so you two can just watch.<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong> Is that really going to be okay...?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Tsubakuro-san says it&#x27;s fine, so there shouldn&#x27;t be an issue.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I suppose our job is just at the start then-.<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong> At the start?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> [whisper whisper whisper]<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong> Ehhh!?<br>
<strong>Hayate:</strong> That team looks like they&#x27;re having fun. Let&#x27;s give it our best shot too!<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> I&#x27;m uh, sorry this turned into a whole thing. This all wouldn&#x27;tve happened if I&#x27;d just eaten the cake straight away.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Maybe that&#x27;s true, but Tsubakuro-san is also at fault for taking it from you.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Let&#x27;s try to win, Inago-san.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Yeah, glad to have you, Sanae, Hayate!<br>
<strong>Hayate:</strong> We&#x27;re counting on you as the referee, Yomi-san.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Understood.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Is everyone ready? Then... Please begin.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Takamachi-san, if you would.<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong> Is this really okay... Uhh, I&#x27;m sorry for this! Bind!<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> The hell is this!? I can&#x27;t move!!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ahaha! That&#x27;s so cool!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Now then, we&#x27;ll be going on ahead-.<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong>ã€€Bind will come undone soon! Sorry!<br>
<strong>Hayate:</strong> Nnn, that&#x27;s Nanoha-chan for you. She got us...<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Isn&#x27;t there anything we can do about this?<br>
<strong>Hayate:</strong> Nanoha-chan said it&#x27;d come undone soon, so I think we&#x27;re better off waiting.<br>
<strong>Hayate:</strong> In the meantime, we can talk strategy.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Okay, that would make the best of our time.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> More than likely, Tsubakuro-san and them are probably going to find Harlaown-san first.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Taking on both Harlaown-san and Tsubakuro-san... It&#x27;ll be a little difficult, Inago-san.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> The question&#x27;s, how can we hold down Yume. If we can take her out of the picture, we can figure out the rest...<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Wait, they&#x27;ve got Nanoha with &#x27;em.<br>
<strong>Hayate:</strong> You can just leave Nanoha-chan to me.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Then that makes what comes after simple. We rush &#x27;em when they&#x27;re fighting Fate, and me and Sanae take out Tsugumi first.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Then, we take on Yume like that. If it&#x27;s 2 on 1 we should be able to manage.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> ...You&#x27;re right that that seem like our best chance of winning...<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> You don&#x27;t like it?<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> ...Kind of. If only I could stop Tsubakuro-san by myself, then you could focus on Harlaown-san, Inago-san...<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Tsubakuro Yume&#x27;s tough. I don&#x27;t even know how well I could do going at her on my own.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> That&#x27;s why this is our best bet.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> ...Okay.<br>
<strong>Hayate:</strong> Akira-san, you make yourself look like a delinquent, but you really are a nice person, huh.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Shaddup. I just like this kinda fashion is all.<br>
<strong>Hayate:</strong> You&#x27;ve got such a nice figure though. I bet you&#x27;d look good whatever you wear, so, why do you go with that?<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> No real reason. Just, somebody I looked up to used to dress like this.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> ...Anyway, I can start moving around now. C&#x27;mon, let&#x27;s go.<br>
<strong>Sanae/Hayate:</strong> Alright!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Found you, Fate-chan! You two, don&#x27;t get in our way!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I know-.<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong> Try your best, Yume-san.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Aha!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Okay then... Let&#x27;s go, Fate-chan!<br>
<strong>Fate:</strong> --!?<br>
<strong>Fate:</strong> Sayaka-chan was fast, but... You&#x27;re quick too, Yume-san!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> You fought with Sayaka-chan?<br>
<strong>Fate:</strong> With Sayaka-san and Kanami-san.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Huh!<br>
<strong>Fate:</strong> They were both very strong.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Then, I&#x27;ve gotta let you know that I&#x27;m even stronger!<br>
<strong>Fate:</strong> --!?<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong>  Yume-chan, she&#x27;s incredible... For the first time, someone&#x27;s matching Fate-chan&#x27;s speed...<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Tsubakuro-san is a special case, after all.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Though... If Harlaown-san is evenly matched with Tsubakuro-san, she must be someone special as well.<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong> Fate-chan is strong too.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> You sure do have faith in her-.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Though, will you help support Tsubakuro-san now?<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong> Sure!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ahahaha! Is that all you&#x27;ve got, Fate-chan?<br>
<strong>Fate:</strong> I can handle this. I can... get more serious!<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Tch, they&#x27;re already going at it. Though... We finally caught up!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="3-are-you-a-sly-dog-or-what"></a>3: Are You a Sly Dog or What?<a class="hash-link" href="#3-are-you-a-sly-dog-or-what" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Akira:</strong> Tch, they&#x27;re already going at it. Though... We finally caught up!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Oh, you came much faster than I was expecting.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Oi oi, you got this much free time on your hands!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> That&#x27;s not exactly it...<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Let&#x27;s go, Tsugumi! ORAA!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> ...!?<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong> Watch out!<br>
<strong>Hayate:</strong>ã€€Not gonna let you, Nanoha-chan!<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong> Hayate-chan!?<br>
<strong>Hayate:</strong> I&#x27;ll be your opponent here!<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Alright! You keep Nanoha company, Hayate!<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Sanae!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> So it came down to this... It&#x27;ll be very hard fighting the both of you though...!?<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Try and see how long you can last!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> ...I&#x27;ll try and last!!<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> HAAAAAAAAAA!!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> ......!!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> ...Ahh, you got me-. Well, there&#x27;s no way I could stand up to that-.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Don&#x27;t think too badly of us, Ban-san. This is just part of the game.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Inago-san! At this rate, Tsubakuro-san will...<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Inago-san?<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Just take a look at that.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ahahaha! This is fun, huh, Fate-chan!<br>
<strong>Fate:</strong> Yes... I&#x27;m having fun, Yume-san!<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> ......Tch.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Sorry for this, after we went and thought up our strategy. There&#x27;s no way for us to break into that one-on-one.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> ...That&#x27;s for sure.<br>
<strong>Hayate:</strong> You sure do look after others a lot, Akira-san.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Oh hey, Hayate. You beat Nanoha already?<br>
<strong>Hayate:</strong> You looked like you were giving up on fighting, so we called a time out.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Time out...? Well, whatever. You can put an end to that too.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Let&#x27;s just wait till these two are done fighting.<br>
<strong>Hayate:</strong> Okaaay.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> ...Doesn&#x27;t this mean I&#x27;m the only one who got beat up-?<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong> Ahaha...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ahh, that was so fun. Let&#x27;s do it again, Fate-chan.<br>
<strong>Fate:</strong> I&#x27;d be happy to do it anytime, Yume-san.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Great!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> ...Wait, huh? What&#x27;re you onee-sans doing?<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Waiting on you two to finish up your fight. Damnit, you took long enough my head cooled off.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> What does that mean?<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> I&#x27;m saying the stuff with the cake is water under the bridge.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Water under the bridge? I&#x27;m the one who fought Fate-chan first, so doesn&#x27;t that make me the winner?<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Huh?<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> ...Whatever, we&#x27;re past that now.<br>
<strong>Hayate:</strong> Mmhm, Akira-san&#x27;s a big sister type; a real good girl.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Oi, who&#x27;re you calling a good girl? You&#x27;re younger than me.<br>
<strong>Hayate:</strong> A good girl is a good girl.<br>
<strong>Hayate:</strong> And... For being such a good girl, I have a present for you.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> It seems the fighting is over.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Yomi?<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Oh yeah, weren&#x27;t you the ref? Where&#x27;d you go?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I went to get this, at Yagami-san&#x27;s request.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> It&#x27;s fresh cake. Isn&#x27;t that nice, Akira.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> ...What the hell.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> If you got more cake, there wasn&#x27;t any point in playing tag, was there?<br>
<strong>Hayate:</strong> We got to have a bit of fun though. It was fun, right?<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> ...Yeah it was. Feels like we&#x27;re all buddies now.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> So anyway, since there&#x27;s more, let&#x27;s head back and have some cake.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Sweet! Cake!<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Hah?<br>
<strong>Nanoha:</strong> Don&#x27;t worry, Akira-san! We made sure to get enough for Yume-san too this time!<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> You did? Geez, who put you up to that... Wait, it was you, wasn&#x27;t it?<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> How long ago&#x27;d you think this up?<br>
<strong>Hayate:</strong> When we offered to play tag. Cake was what got you two fighting, so cake would help you make up.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> I can&#x27;t go taking my eyes off you, huh.<br>
<strong>Hayate:</strong> Thank you very much.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> That wasn&#x27;t meant to be a compliment...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> What kind of cake do you like, Fate-chan?<br>
<strong>Fate:</strong> I like... I like any cake.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Well, whatever.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations/edit/docs/Nanoha_DOPPELGANGER.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_2_ui" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_3DPF"></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"></div></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_35-E thin-scrollbar"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#1-what-are-the-toji-like-2-days-until-the-collab-event" class="table-of-contents__link">1: What Are the Toji Like? ~2 Days Until the Collab Event~</a></li><li><a href="#2-are-aradama-something-scary-1-days-until-the-collab-event" class="table-of-contents__link">2: Are Aradama Something Scary? ~1 Days Until the Collab Event~</a></li><li><a href="#1-the-doppelganger-rumors" class="table-of-contents__link">1: The Doppelganger Rumors</a></li><li><a href="#2-the-doppelgangers-true-form" class="table-of-contents__link">2: The Doppelgangers&#39; True Form</a></li><li><a href="#3-a-promise-for-after-were-done" class="table-of-contents__link">3: A Promise for After We&#39;re Done</a></li><li><a href="#4-meeting-the-aradama" class="table-of-contents__link">4: Meeting the Aradama</a></li><li><a href="#5-a-hard-fought-battle" class="table-of-contents__link">5: A Hard Fought Battle</a></li><li><a href="#6-our-magic" class="table-of-contents__link">6: Our Magic</a></li><li><a href="#1-im-not-lettin-that-go" class="table-of-contents__link">1: I&#39;m Not Lettin&#39; That Go</a></li><li><a href="#2-playing-tag" class="table-of-contents__link">2: Playing Tag</a></li><li><a href="#3-are-you-a-sly-dog-or-what" class="table-of-contents__link">3: Are You a Sly Dog or What?</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Links</div><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://pastebin.com/LdyviZ8Z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Translator anon&#x27;s pastebin<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Site source code<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Built with Docusaurus.</div></div></div></footer></div>
