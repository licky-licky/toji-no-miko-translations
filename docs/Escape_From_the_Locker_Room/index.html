<strong>Akira:</strong> Every day&#x27;s seriously hot as hell...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> You&#x27;re not wrong... I always forget to put on sunscreen too, even though I really should...<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> I know it&#x27;s easy to forget, but you&#x27;ve gotta do it. You&#x27;re gonna be hurting later otherwise.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> ...You actually do that kind of thing properly, huh, Inago-san. I sort of didn&#x27;t expect that from you...<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> It&#x27;s one of the must haves when you&#x27;re doing a bike tour in the summertime.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Even Inago-san is telling you, so you have to make sure to put sunscreen on, Kanami-chan. Wouldn&#x27;t you have forgotten today if I hadn&#x27;t reminded you?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ahaha...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Are you still letting Mai do everything for you?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> That&#x27;s only because Mai-chan&#x27;s always noticing all kinds of things.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> By the way, Hiyori-chan, Mai-chan. Since we worked up a sweat, want to take a shower and then have some fun in the pool?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> The pool... Well, it&#x27;s definitely hot enough for it.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> That sounds nice; I think I&#x27;ll go.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> And of course, you&#x27;re invited too, Inago-san, Kitora-san!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I see. I&#x27;ll take you up on your offer.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Bring it on! Let&#x27;s get going!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah, before we get changed, I&#x27;m going to get something to drink! If anybody wants me to get them anything, just say so-.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> How about; could you get me some cold Japanese tea?<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Good looking out, Kanami. I&#x27;ll take a cola!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I still have the mineral water I brought along for our mission, but, could I ask you to get another of the same kind?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Got it-. What about you, Mai-chan?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I can&#x27;t think of anything off the top of my head, so I&#x27;ll go with you. You&#x27;ll have your hands full buying all those drinks anyway.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Thanks! I was actually feeling a little hungry too, so I thought I&#x27;d buy some snacks while I was at it. With you along, I can get a bunch--<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> ...Huh?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> What&#x27;s the matter?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> The door won&#x27;t open for some reason.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Eh... You&#x27;re right... I can&#x27;t get it to move an inch.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Out of the way for a sec. --ORAA!<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Damnit, no matter how many kicks I give it, it won&#x27;t budge. What&#x27;s the deal...<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I asked Sayaka-chan and Shichinosato-san, who were at Renpu, to call a staff member, but...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> We&#x27;re completely trapped in here, aren&#x27;t we.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Why doesn&#x27;t this place have air conditioning when the window&#x27;s built into the wall and you can&#x27;t even open it...!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> We don&#x27;t even know how long it&#x27;ll take before the staff get here, but we&#x27;ll cook in here like this...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> ...This is an extremely undesirable situation. The only drinks we have are my and Yanase Mai&#x27;s mineral waters.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> We do have some food too, but only these cookies I made.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Just as Etou Kanami said, if we simply wait like this for rescue, we all risk dehydration.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> For sure. Okay, I&#x27;m busting the window open.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> S-Stop right there, Inago Akira!<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Huh? If we don&#x27;t let the hot air out, we&#x27;re dehydrating, right? So we&#x27;ve gotta break the window, don&#x27;t we?<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> That&#x27;ll let us call out for help too, so it&#x27;s two birds with one stone.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> It is not two birds with one stone! We should start by thinking of our other options!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Th-That&#x27;s right. Breaking the window should be our last resort...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...What are you even doing.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Mai, let&#x27;s test and see if there&#x27;s any way we can get this door open.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Okay, Hiyori-chan. There might be something that can help left in the lockers here too--<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> ...EH!?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> What&#x27;s wrong!?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I-In the locker, there&#x27;s a person covered in blood...!!<br>
<strong>Akira/Kanami/Mirja:</strong> ...A-A DEAD BODY!?!?  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="2-a-murder-case-in-a-hot-and-humid-locked-room"></a>2: A Murder Case in a Hot and Humid Locked Room...?<a class="hash-link" href="#2-a-murder-case-in-a-hot-and-humid-locked-room" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Kanami:</strong> Wh-Wh-What happened!? When they fell out, it made a huge noise, and...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Calm down, Kanami. First we need to check the body.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> I&#x27;ll... do the checking. Anybody who doesn&#x27;t want to see, turn away.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Inago-san...!<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Sorry. Let me just... get a look at your face--<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> If it&#x27;s you, Boss, you can look over every little inch of me!<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> ...Wait, Yui!? All that blood-- Are you okay!?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I&#x27;m just fine. This is only from a nosebleed I got.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> That&#x27;s a nosebleed...? Ugh, and now I&#x27;ve got your nosebleed on me...!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ehehe. Sorry about that, Boss. If you take your clothes off for me, I&#x27;ll wash them and give them back to you.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> ...I&#x27;ll wash &#x27;em myself.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> More importantly... Why were you inside that locker?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> See, I hid in there so I could peep on girls while they were changing, but it got way too hot and I got all dizzy. Ahaha.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Err...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Seeing you come out of the locker, I assumed it was something like that...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> That&#x27;s my Mirja-san! We know each other inside and out!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Sigh... This feels more uncomfortably hot than usual.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> That cold attitude of yours feels nice and refreshing to me, Mirja-san!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong>  It&#x27;s a relief at least to see you&#x27;re doing okay. Anyway, let&#x27;s all try pushing on the door.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> I guess it&#x27;s... better than doing nothing.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> What if... the lock is stuck in a strange way?<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Moving around makes it feel even hotter in here... Aghh... If I just had my okatana, this door wouldn&#x27;t even be a problem...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> It&#x27;s not as if I don&#x27;t understand how you feel, but that would be a problem in and of itself.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> I get that. And, I might&#x27;ve made things even worse with all the kicking I did...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> There&#x27;s no use worrying over that. None of us made an attempt to stop you at the time either.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> It doesn&#x27;t seem like there&#x27;s anything in the locker room we can use... Maybe our best bet is just to sit tight and wait for help to get here.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Considering our situation, it would be wise to preserve our stamina as best as possible.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Though, there&#x27;s little we can do besides stay still and avoid the areas where sunlight shines in.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> [gulp gulp]... Phew. The water is pretty warm at this point, but, if you drink some, you&#x27;ll feel better.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> We don&#x27;t have that much left, though you shouldn&#x27;t push yourselves too hard, so don&#x27;t hold back if you need it.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Okay. And also, Mai-chan, could I have some cookies too?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> ...I think your throat would feel dry after eating them, but, so long as you don&#x27;t mind that.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I&#x27;m really starving now.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Mmm, every time I have them, Mai-chan&#x27;s cookies are just too good!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Give me some too! I want Mai-chan&#x27;s handmade cookies!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ahhh... This is the taste of Mai-chan.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Mm... Now my mouth&#x27;s all dried out...<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> That&#x27;s why I told you. Here, have some water.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Mmnn...<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Ah...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Phwah. It feels like you&#x27;ve been helping me out every step of the way today, Mai-chan.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Mirja-san, please let me have some of your water-.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Here you go.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I&#x27;m drinking it, Mirja-san!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> ...I&#x27;d appreciate it if you didn&#x27;t mention my name every time.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Yui, let me see it next. It&#x27;s rough sweating this much without anything to drink.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Both of you, please be careful not to drink too much. What little we have is precious.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Do you want a drink too, Hiyori-chan?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...Sure. I&#x27;ll have just a few sips.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I never thought I&#x27;d be this grateful for some water, huh-.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> [gulp gulp]... It&#x27;s not something you&#x27;d normally pay attention to.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Let&#x27;s keep this up and pull through! I&#x27;m sure we only have to wait a little bit longer!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="3-a-flash-of-inspiration-in-the-steamy-heat"></a>3: A Flash of Inspiration in the Steamy Heat...!<a class="hash-link" href="#3-a-flash-of-inspiration-in-the-steamy-heat" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Ughh... It&#x27;s so hot it makes me want to tie up my hair.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Your hair is pretty long, Hiyori-chan.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> If only I had a hair tie on me.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> It&#x27;s fine, Mai. If I bunch it up with my hand like this, it already feels a lot different.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Kh... With her hair bunched up like that, I&#x27;m getting hit with a rare side of Hiyori-chan&#x27;s charms... Her nape&#x27;s so cute too!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Between how hot and muggy it is in here, I can&#x27;t even bring myself to say anything.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Are you doing okay, Hiyori-chan? As an apology, I&#x27;ll fan you. How&#x27;s that? Does it feel cooler?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...A little bit. Still, why are you...<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Y-Yui-chan!? Fanning your skirt around... You shouldn&#x27;t do that!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> But, this fans the most air, doesn&#x27;t it? I don&#x27;t have a real fan or any kind of sheet to use.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Yui, do it over my way too.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I&#x27;m on it!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> With all this heat, our standards of judgment are evaporating...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Then, I&#x27;m doing it too! If we both fan with our skirts, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll--<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> YOU ARE NOT DOING THAT! ABSOLUTELY NOT!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> ...O-Okay!?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> That goes for everyone else too! As a toji, and as a girl... Please act with some decency!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> We&#x27;re all out of water by now... aren&#x27;t we.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> We all drank it little by little, but in this heat, it wouldn&#x27;t last regardless.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> On top of that, the sweat and humidity&#x27;s making my shirt sticky and gross...<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> What Mai said&#x27;s still right and all, but... You gotta compromise at some point. I&#x27;m taking my clothes off.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> ...I-Inago-san?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Me too...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> What matters most is preserving our lives... Taking that option is unavoidable.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> ...!?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Mai-chan... We came here to put on our swimsuits anyway, so this really isn&#x27;t all that different!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Ehhh...<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> (...Is it though? I feel like it&#x27;s still wrong...)<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ahh~... If this is the last thing I see before I die, I&#x27;ll die satisfied...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I want to say this is the same as her usual self, but... Even Yamashiro Yui is in poor condition.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> It&#x27;s open...! Mai, Kanami, Hiyori!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Sayaka-chan! Ahh~... I&#x27;m so glad to see you.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> So hot... What is this, a sauna? Everybody still alive~?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...Wait, what&#x27;re you all looking like that for!? Well, I guess if it&#x27;s this hot, what else can you do.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> We brought you stuff to drink. You&#x27;d better be grateful!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> We&#x27;re in your debt... Shichinosato Kofuki, Itomi Sayaka.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> [gulp gulp gulp]... Ahh. Who&#x27;d have thought some ice cold water&#x27;d be this tasty. Seriously... You saved our asses.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Kanami and everyone else, you should drink too.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Sure!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> We were right at our limit...<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> We really were... The water bottle feels so cool and nice...<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> You too, Yui. It&#x27;s cold and tasty.<br>

Do you have free time the day after tomorrow?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I think I should be available. Why?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> There&#x27;s going to be a festival nearby. I want to go together.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Because we&#x27;ve been busy with missions, I haven&#x27;t been together with you lately. I think the festival will definitely be fun.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> You&#x27;re probably right. Why don&#x27;t we go enjoy ourselves together, since it&#x27;s been a while.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...Mm!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mai, she&#x27;s still not here. I didn&#x27;t get any messages either... What happened?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> (Mai will come for sure. I want to take a look around at everything, so Mai can have fun when she gets here.)<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> I think she&#x27;ll be hungry when she arrives, so, takoyaki... or yakisoba? They have okonomiyaki too. I can&#x27;t decide.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> After that, we can eat shaved ice while we watch the fireworks... It might be fun to try the shooting range and goldfish scooping too.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...Nn. I smell something sweet... from over this way.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> &quot;Baby castella&quot;...?<br>
<strong>Stall Worker:</strong> Missy, you never eaten one of them before?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> I haven&#x27;t.<br>
<strong>Stall Worker:</strong> Go on and try one. If you like it, come and buy some more. Here.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Thank you.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> -! It&#x27;s tasty...<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> After I meet with my friend, I&#x27;ll come buy some for sure.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> (If I eat these with Mai, I know it&#x27;ll taste even better...)<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> In a few minutes... it&#x27;ll be 8 o&#x27;clock. The fireworks will be over soon too. Today is already...<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> (Will I not get to go around the festival with Mai...?)<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Sayaka-chan... I&#x27;m sorry! I didn&#x27;t think I would be this late.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mai...!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> My phone ran out of batteries too, so I couldn&#x27;t contact you. Ahh, thank goodness I found you.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm. We can see the last fireworks too. You made it in time.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Ah, there they go! Woww, it&#x27;s so pretty... Look, Sayaka-chan.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> They&#x27;re twinkling... That&#x27;s amazing.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> As you&#x27;d expect from the last rocket, it sure had a lot of impact. What should we do from here?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> I thought of a lot of places I wanted to go see with you.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> In that case, I guess I&#x27;ll leave everything to you, Sayaka-chan.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm. This way! First, we&#x27;ll--<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Since we were their last customers, the takoyaki stall gave us some extra.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> The extras... There were kind of a lot of them.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> I think my belly might be full after that... But I want to eat these with you, Mai.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> They were really tasty.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> These are baby castella? Then, I&#x27;ll have some. --Mmm, they&#x27;re sweet and delicious.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> They&#x27;re soft and covered in lots of maple syrup... I feel like I could eat any amount of them... Ohm.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> You really seem to like them. I don&#x27;t eat them very often myself, but I do like them too.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> (It shouldn&#x27;t be that hard to make baby castella. Maybe I&#x27;ll make them for her as a snack next time?)<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> There were still... more places I wanted to see with you though.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Lots of them have already started closing up their stalls, haven&#x27;t they.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> But, I&#x27;m glad I got to see the festival with you, Mai.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I feel the same way. Thank you for inviting me. Let&#x27;s go out again some other day, when we don&#x27;t have missions.<br>

<strong>Akira:</strong> Right? Didn&#x27;t I call it when I said we should spend the night here?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Though, after you suggested we camp here right after our mission, I did wonder if you had lost your mind.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> ...Ouch. The people at the campsite even said they&#x27;d lend us their equipment. We just had to buy something to eat.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> It was probably a good change of pace for the rest of them too, and anyway, I&#x27;m hungry, so let&#x27;s get to making breakfast!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Alright. I&#x27;d like something warm to eat. More specifically, I&#x27;d like freshly cooked rice.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Figured you&#x27;d say that. I&#x27;m counting on you for the rice. I&#x27;ll be getting the perfect side dish ready for it.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Please do.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Hey. That rice you&#x27;ve got cooking smells good.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I had the rice soak in water, so it should cook nicely.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Though, if I wanted to cook it to the best of my ability, I would want to let it soak for another thirty minutes or so...<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Waiting an hour to eat is pushing it, don&#x27;t you think.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Isn&#x27;t rice something you should put up with an empty stomach for?<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> It&#x27;s not like I don&#x27;t get you, but, after I went and foil roasted this salmon, I don&#x27;t want it getting cold.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> I threw in a bunch of onions, carrots, and shimeji mushrooms too. You&#x27;re gonna love it.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> It seems like it would complement the rice.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> What, is rice the main dish here...? Ahh, this smell&#x27;s making me want miso soup now. I shoulda bought some while I was out.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> We both... made some oversights.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> The rice should be cooked. Once it&#x27;s steamed for a bit, we can eat.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Mmm~~, that&#x27;s so good! You seriously cook rice better than anybody!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> You flatter me too much. The roasted salmon and soft-boiled eggs you made are delicious too.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Yeah, but that&#x27;s all easy stuff to make.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Seeing you staring down that canteen of rice earlier, it reminded me of that school camp trip we did back in 5th grade. Didn&#x27;t you cook us rice back then too?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I did. It was my first time cooking outdoors with a canteen, but I really wanted to try it.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Back then... I was too slow in turning the rice over, so lots of it ended up scorched at the bottom.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> But y&#x27;know, I still really like rice when it&#x27;s scorched. And we were having curry, so nobody cared much.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> That school camping trip sure was fun. We couldn&#x27;t get to sleep, so we stayed up talking, and then the teacher got mad.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> That was because you were talking too loudly.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Was it? You remember that pretty good. Hard to think that back then, we still didn&#x27;t even know yet if we&#x27;d be toji-.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I know.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I wouldn&#x27;t have imagined you would go dye your hair like that either, Akira.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Here I am going a little down memory lane, and you&#x27;ve gotta bring that up? You think it doesn&#x27;t look good on me? It looks good, right...?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> It does look good.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> See?<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Anyway, we&#x27;re done eating, so how &#x27;bout we clean things up before we head back-.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Let&#x27;s.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations/edit/docs/Escape_From_the_Locker_Room.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_2_ui" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_3DPF"></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"></div></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_35-E thin-scrollbar"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#1-another-great-day-for-the-pool" class="table-of-contents__link">1: Another Great Day For the Pool!</a></li><li><a href="#2-a-murder-case-in-a-hot-and-humid-locked-room" class="table-of-contents__link">2: A Murder Case in a Hot and Humid Locked Room...?</a></li><li><a href="#3-a-flash-of-inspiration-in-the-steamy-heat" class="table-of-contents__link">3: A Flash of Inspiration in the Steamy Heat...!</a></li><li><a href="#4-a-moment-at-a-summer-festival-spent-with-fireworks" class="table-of-contents__link">4: A Moment at a Summer Festival Spent with Fireworks</a></li><li><a href="#5-the-smells-of-summer-and-canteen-cooked-rice" class="table-of-contents__link">5: The Smells of Summer and Canteen Cooked Rice</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Links</div><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://pastebin.com/LdyviZ8Z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Translator anon&#x27;s pastebin<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Site source code<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Built with Docusaurus.</div></div></div></footer></div>
