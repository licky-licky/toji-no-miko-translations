## 1: Human Egg
**Mirja:** ...Hidden among us are two impostors. Asakura Mihono, Musumi Kiyoka. Which faction do you belong to?  
**Mihono:** I'm an "Egg"! You have to believe me, Mirja-san!  
**Kiyoka:** I'm not a "Human" either... But, what about you, Mirja-san...?  
**Kanami:** Take it easy, you three. It's not going to help if we doubt each other before we can even prove anything.  
**Mai:** Mmhm. We've only just started the first sunrise, after all...  
**Hiyori:** No, there's nothing wrong with a little investigating, is there? Though, I doubt any Human is going to give themselves up so easy.  
**Sayaka:** ............  
**Ellen:** Oh? Saaya, what's the matter? If you keep being so quiet, everyone's going to start suspecting you.  
**Sayaka:** ...But, I don't know what I should say. This is my first time playing this game...  
**Ellen:** Oh! That's right! Then, let's pause the game for a minute--  
**Ellen:** Ahem. Now then, to help out Saaya, I'll go over the rules for "Human Egg" once more.  
**Ellen:** This is a kind of deduction game, where the players are divided into the Egg faction and the Human faction. The story is that Humans have transformed with magic to sneak into the village where the Eggs live peacefully.  
**Ellen:** Eggs are a Human's favorite food. At night, when the Eggs are sound asleep, the Humans reveal their true forms, and go around eating one Egg each night.  
**Ellen:** If this goes on, the Egg village will be wiped out. That's why, during the day, the Eggs will hold a discussion and vote on a suspicious Egg to be crack open at a time.  
**Ellen:** However, even if you crack an Egg that's actually a Human in disguise, it doesn't mean the transformation magic will wear off. That's what makes this game so fun and hard.  
**Sayaka:** Mm. It does sound hard...  
**Mai:** Though, it's not as if we won't get hints, Sayaka-chan.  
**Kanami:** Yeah. After all, the Egg faction has three kinds of allies with handy special powers on their side.  
**Sayaka:** Allies...?  
**Mihono:** The first one is "Humpty Dumpty". During the night, they have the ability to check one Egg to see if they're real or not.  
**Mihono:** They can only check once every other day, but I'd say it's the most important role to play.  
**Sayaka:** Humpty Dumpty can check Eggs... Okay. I understand.  
**Kiyoka:** The second is the "Easter Egg", with the power to resurrect. It only works if that person retires after being eaten by a Human, but after that, when the next Human is out, it revives you.  
**Kiyoka:** It only revives you after the morning of the next day, but, if the Easter Egg does resurrect someone, we know that someone who retired the previous day must be an impostor.  
**Hiyori:** And then, with the Egg faction, there's an ally called a "Rabbit" that uses transformation magic like the Humans.  
**Sayaka:** Rabbit...?  
**Hiyori:** Yeah. The Rabbit is friendly to the Eggs, and when it becomes night, they secretly reveals themselves, using their power to protect one Egg from the Humans.  
**Hiyori:** But, they can't protect themselves. If their identity comes out, the Humans should go straight after them.  
**Hiyori:** Also, if Humpty Dumpty inspects them, the result will be "Not an Egg", so you have to be careful not to crack the Rabbit by accident.  
**Sayaka:** The Easter Egg can resurrect you... The Rabbit isn't an Egg, but they protect Eggs... Nn, I get most of it.  
**Ellen:** Okay. Then, that's all for the rules to Human Egg.  
**Ellen:** The dedicated app we downloaded to your phone will cover the rest, so you just need to repeat what happens during the night and day parts.  
**Ellen:** This time, between the eight of us, there are two Humans disguised as Eggs. Once the humans eliminate all the Eggs, or the Eggs eliminate all the Humans, the last faction standing is the winner.  
**Mai:** Ah, if there's something you don't understand while we're playing the game, you can ask us anything, alright?  
**Sayaka:** Okay. I'll ask when that happens.  
**Ellen:** Of course. So then, let's get the game started again.  
**Ellen:** ...By the way, who is Humpty Dumpty? Since you should finish your judging by the first night, most play with them coming out and saying their results.  
**Sayaka:** They do? Then, I'll come out. I'm Humpty Dumpty.  
**Sayaka:** I didn't really know what to do, but I checked Hiyori next to me. It said she was an Egg.  
**Hiyori:** Alright, good. That means you know Sayaka and I are innocent.  
**Kanami:** Nah, we don't know that for sure yet, Hiyori-chan. Somebody might come out and oppose her.  
**Sayaka:** Oppose...? Mai, what does that mean?  
**Mai:** After someone announces their role, if someone else comes out and says "I'm the real one," then that's called opposing.  
**Mihono:** Still, it looks like... nobody's going to oppose it. Which means we know Itomi-san's the real one.  
**Kanami:** Huh? Nobody's going to do it? Mmm, It'd be more exciting if somebody opposed her though-.  
**Hiyori:** Hm...  
**Mai:** Ah...  
**Mirja:** ......  
**Ellen:** So that's how you feel, Kanamin... I see how it is.  
**Kanami:** Eh? What's everyone looking at me like that for? I didn't say anything that weird, did I?  
**Hiyori:** Well, who knows...  
**Mirja:** Now then, why don't we move on to the first day's voting.  
**School Announcement:** Aradama have been confirmed to have appeared in the vicinity of the campus. Toji are to prepare to sortie at once. I repeat. Aradama have been confirmed--  
**Ellen:** Wow! We got called to action at a time like this!  
**Kiyoka:** We'll have to pause this here, won't we...  
**Mihono:** Let's go, guys! The faster we get rid of the aradama, the faster we can start the game again!  

## 2: Reliable Ally
**Mihono:** We safely took care of the aradama, so let's get right back to the game!  
**Kanami:** Hmmm, who should I vote for-? It's hard to pick, since it's the very first one... Did you decide already, Hiyori-chan?  
**Hiyori:** Sure. I decided a while ago.  
**Kanami:** Ehh!? On who!?  
**Hiyori:** ...You'll know soon.  
**Ellen:** Is everyone ready to go? Then, vote in the app for the person you think is a Human, and push the button.  
**Mai:** Sayaka-chan, did you figure out how to vote?  
**Sayaka:** I'm okay. I pushed the button now.  
**App Announcer:** Voting has been recorded. I will now announce the results of the voting.  
**Kanami:** Ah, here it comes! Alright, who's going to be the first egg to crack~?  
**Kanami:** ...Wait, huhhh!?  
**Voting Results:** Hiyori, Mirja, Ellen, Mai, Mihono, Sayaka --> Kanami. Kanami --> Ellen.  
**App Announcer:** As a result of the voting, it has been decided that Kanami-san will be cracked today.  
**Kanami:** J-J-Just like that~!? But, but, why me~!?  
**Hiyori:** If someone had opposed Humpty Dumpty, then Sayaka and I would have our innocence disproven. But you were the one saying you wished someone would oppose us. So of course this happened.  
**Ellen:** I felt the same. It looked like Kanamin was a Human signalling to her ally to come out and oppose them.  
**Mirja:** In the first place, I cannot imagine Itomi Sayaka, who had only just learned the rules, would pretend to be Humpty Dumpty right away.  
**Mai:** Sorry, Kanami-chan. Saying what you said didn't really seem like it would help the Egg faction at all.  
**App Announcer:** Now, Kanami-san, please retire.  
**Kanami:** Uwehh~! You're kidding me~! I just wanted to have more fun playingggg~!  
**Mihono:** Kanami, rest in peace... So, next is the night part, right?  
**Kiyoka:** U-Um... Before that, should we talk about who the Rabbit should protect first?  
**Kiyoka:** I think we should pick between Itomi-san and Juujou-san, since they were already proven innocent...  
**Ellen:** I think it'd be best to protect Saaya.  
**Mai:** I'll agree with that.  
**Mirja:** Yes. If Humpty Dumpty is able to remain until the third day, they can then carry out a second inspection. The game would progress in the Egg faction's favor.  
**Kiyoka:** That's right... isn't it. Then, I'll agree with that suggestion.  
**Ellen:** With that settled, let's start the night part. The app will advance on its own from here, so everyone, close your eyes.  
**App Announcer:** ...Night falls across the Egg village.  
**App Announcer:** The Humans may open their eyes and discuss in the chat menu which Egg they will decide to eat.  
**???:** .............  
**App Announcer:** Now, the Rabbit may open their eyes and decide which Egg they will protect.  
**Sayaka:** (Ah... Kanami might have been the Rabbit, but we didn't think of that...)  
**Sayaka:** (If she was, then no one will be protected... If they choose Humpty Dumpty, no one will save me.)  
**Sayaka:** (I'm a little nervous... I want this bad feeling to be wrong...)  
**App Announcer:** All selections have been finished. Morning comes to the Egg village.  
**Sayaka:** .........  
**App Announcer:** It is now morning. Everyone, please open your eyes. Last night, no Eggs were eaten.  
**Mihono:** Eh? Then, that means...  
**Kiyoka:** It looks like the Rabbit's protection worked, Hono-chan!  
**Hiyori:** This is getting interesting now. It's safe to say things are going well for the Egg faction.  
**Mirja:** Yes. And also, we were able to confirm the Rabbit's existence. If things go well, then we should be able to hear the results of Humpty Dumpty's inspection again on the third day.  
**Sayaka:** (Phew...)  
**Mai:** Isn't that great, Sayaka-chan? You made it safely to morning.  
**Sayaka:** ...Mm.  
**Ellen:** Alright then, let's start the discussions for the second day! Let's scope out the Humans hiding in the Egg village!  

## 3: Doubt
**Mirja:** The next most suspicious person would be... That's right. If I had to name one, it would be Musumi Kiyoka, wouldn't it.  
**Kiyoka:** Eh...? Me...?  
**Mirja:** Yes. There was something concerning about what you said yesterday.  
**Sayaka:** Something concerning...?  
**Mirja:** Yes. Last night, it should have been plainly evident that Itomi Sayaka, as Humpty Dumpty, was more valuable than Juujou Hiyori, whose role has not been identified.  
**Mirja:** In spite of that, Musumi Kiyoka expressly asked which of them the Rabbit should protect. If she were an Egg, that would be a slightly unnatural thing to say.  
**Kiyoka:** Ah, no, that was... I was just a little curious what everyone wanted to do, so I asked...  
**Mihono:** Ahh~! That's super suspicious! I think maybe I'll vote for Kiyoka next time~. Hey, you guys think so too, right?  
**Hiyori:** I don't really have a problem with that, but... Ellen. What do you think about what Mihono just said?  
**Ellen:** Hmm. I don't mind doing some "Kiyoka cracking", but I can't say Mihomiho's leaving a great impression either.  
**Mai:** Right... What Mihono-chan said now sounded like she might have been acting as a Human to lead us into "cracking Kiyoka"...  
**Mihono:** Y-You've got it all wrong, Mai! Mirja-san's the one who was suspicious of Kiyoka, and I was just tagging along!  
**Ellen:** I hate to break it to you, Mihomiho, but thinking like you should "tag along" with other people's opinions is a very very Human move to do.  
**Sayaka:** Then, for this vote, we should vote for Mihono...?  
**Mihono:** Uweeeh~! I'm telling you, just hold on~! We know Kiyoka was acting suspicious, so let's think this over some more~!  
**Mai:** You do have a point, but... Ah, everyone, how about if we do this then?  
**Mai:** Since the Rabbit is here, they should be able to protect Sayaka-chan again tonight--  
**Mai:** In which case, if Mihono-chan makes it to the third day, we can have Sayaka-chan inspect her, and then we'll know for sure if she's innocent, won't we?  
**Hiyori:** Makes sense. And, on the other hand, if we crack Mihono here, it might be even harder to figure out the truth.  
**Mirja:** Then, the one we should vote for this time would be... Musumi Kiyoka. Do you have anything you would like to say for yourself now?  
**Kiyoka:** Ah, yes... Whoever the Rabbit is, please make sure to protect Itomi-san tonight. That's all I have to say...  
**Kanami:** Oh, finally, I'll have a friend over here!  
**Mirja:** Etou Kanami. While the game is in session, those who have retired are forbidden from speaking.  
**Kanami:** Ah, right... I'm sorry.  
**Ellen:** Fufu. I think we heard a voice we shouldn't have been able to hear anymore, but let's move onto the voting now.  
**Ellen:** And also, once it becomes the night part, will the Rabbit please protect Saaya, and will Saaya please inspect Mihomiho.  
**Sayaka:** Nn, I got it.  
**App Announcer:** ...It is now morning. Everyone, please open your eyes.  
**App Announcer:** The one who was eaten last night was: Juujou-san. Juujou-san, please retire.  
**Hiyori:** ...Sure, I understand.  
**Mai:** So Hiyori-chan got eaten... Then, that means there's only five of us left.  
**Mai:** Sayaka-chan, what did the results of the inspection say?  
**Sayaka:** I inspected Mihono, like you told me. It said Mihono was "Not an Egg".  
**Ellen:** Is that so. Then, today we're going "Mihono cracking", it looks like.  
**Mihono:** Actually, I don't think that's such a good idea. Since, last night, I was the one who protected Itomi-san.  
**Sayaka:** Eh...? Mihono, you were the Rabbit...?  
**Mirja:** No, no matter how you look at it, I can't imagine that's anything more than a lie in desperation. That's something that she should have come about about yesterday.  
**Mirja:** Now, let's start with the voting. If either of Etou Kanami or Musumi Kiyoka were Humans, then this should mean our victory.  
**App Announcer:** As a result of the voting, it has been decided that Mihono-san will be cracked today. Mihono-san, please retire.  
**Mihono:** Wahhn~! You're all so mean~! I told you I'm the Rabbit, didn't I~!  
**Sayaka:** Ellen, what happens now?  
**Ellen:** If Mihomiho was the second Human, the app should announce that the Egg faction wins now...  
**Ellen:** ...Hmm, it's not saying anything. Then it looks like the game is still going.  
**Mirja:** I see then... Which would mean, we need to re-examine our deductions so far.  
**Mai:** Right... But, I think it's for sure that we broke one Human. If two Humans were still around at this stage, it would announce the Human faction had won instead.  
**Ellen:** Yes... And, with this number of people, the game should end tomorrow. I don't know who will be targeted tonight, but let's try to win with who we have left.  
**App Announcer:** With that, night falls across the Egg village. Everyone, please close your eyes.  
**Sayaka:** ............  
**Sayaka:** (Tonight, I'll probably be the one who gets eaten... I'm the only one left who was proven innocent...)  
**Sayaka:** (This was my first game, but, I had fun.)  
**App Announcer:** ...It is now morning. Everyone, please open your eyes.  

## 4: Which One is Human?
**App Announcer:** The one who was eaten last night was: Ellen-san. Ellen-san, please retire.  
**Sayaka:** Eh... It wasn't me...?  
**Ellen:** Oh... It's a real shame I won't be able to join in the last discussion. Good luck with the rest, everyone.  
**Mirja:** ...With that, there are only three of us remaining.  
**Hiyori:** No, I'm here too.  
**Sayaka:** Eh...  
**App Announcer:** The Easter Egg's ability, resurrection, has activated. Juujou-san, please return to the game.  
**Hiyori:** I got the notification just a second ago. After the Easter Egg gets eaten by Humans and retires, once a Human retires, it can resurrect you and bring you back.  
**Hiyori:** And this also means we know for sure that Mihono was a Human.  
**Mirja:** Which means, there are four of us remaining... However, as we know Itomi Sayaka and Juujou Hiyori have been proven innocent, the only possible Humans are Yanase Mai and myself.  
**Hiyori:** Right. But first, let's put everything we know in order.  
**Hiyori:** Sayaka was Humpty Dumpty, and I was the Easter Egg. Then, Mihono was a Human, and Kanami, Kiyoka, and Ellen were from the Egg faction. Does that all sound right so far?  
**Mirja:** Yes. Nothing about that is mistaken.  
**Hiyori:** Okay. Then, what caught my attention next is, who was the Rabbit... For starters, it can't be Kanami. Since, after Kanami retired, the Rabbit's protection activated again.  
**Hiyori:** Which means, it could only be Kiyoka, Ellen, Mai, or Mirja.  
**Sayaka:** Mai, Mirja, are you not the Rabbit?  
**Mai:** That's right. I'm an Egg, Hiyori-chan.  
**Mirja:** And I... I'm not the Rabbit either.  
**Hiyori:** So neither of you will come out and say you're the Rabbit then.  
**Hiyori:** If one of you did claim to be the rabbit, we could ask who you'd protected so far, and we might be able to tell something from that... But it doesn't look like that's happening.  
**Hiyori:** Sayaka, which of them do you think is more suspicious?  
**Sayaka:** I can't tell... But, Mirja was the first one to suspect Kiyoka.  
**Mirja:** No, that shouldn't be considered a reason. There was certainly something off about what Musumi Kiyoka had said the previous day. I recall everyone agreeing as much as well.  
**Sayaka:** Then, Mai is the Human...? I remember, Mai covered for Mihono.  
**Mai:** I didn't. I wasn't covering for her; I only wanted to make sure whether or not Mihono-chan was innocent. I'm an Egg. You have to believe me, Sayaka-chan.  
**Hiyori:** This is tough. Both of their arguments sound convincing. In that case, we're just going to have to go with our gut feeling...  
**Hiyori:** ...Sayaka, you should be the one to make the call here. Since I retired partway through, there should be things I didn't notice. So I'll go along with whatever you decide.  
**Sayaka:** ...Okay, I understand.  
**Sayaka:** Is that okay with you, Mai, Mirja?  
**Mirja:** Yes, I don't mind. Whichever way, I have no option but to vote for Yanase Mai in the next voting period.  
**Mai:** Mmhm. I can't vote for anyone besides Kitora-san either, so it's up to you who decides which of us gets cracked, Sayaka-chan.  
**Hiyori:** Alright, it's decided then.  
**Sayaka:** (This decision will mean whether we win or lose. It's a big responsibility. But, since I made it all the way to the last day... I want to do finish it.)  
**Sayaka:** (Mai and Mirja both have parts that seemed suspicious. So it wouldn't be strange if either of them were a Human.)  
**Sayaka:** (But, if I think carefully back from the first day, there should be some clues...)  
**Sayaka:** (...Ah, I know. That means, the Human might be...)  
**Hiyori:** Sayaka, did you make up your mind?  
**Sayaka:** ...Mm.  
**Mirja/Mai:** ...........  
**Hiyori:** Alright. Then, tell me who I should vote for.  

## 5: Smile When the Game is Over
**Sayaka:** I'm going... to vote for Mai.  
**Mirja/Mai:** ...!  
**Hiyori:** I see... Okay then. Let's get right to voting.  
**Sayaka:** Mai, if I got it wrong... I'm sorry.  
**Mai:** No, you don't have to worry about that, Sayaka-chan. That's just the kind of game this is.  
**App Announcer:** The voting has finished. I will now announce the results of the voting.  
**Voting Targets:** Sayaka, Hiyori, Mirja --> Mai. Mai --> Mirja.  
**App Announcer:** As a result of the voting, it has been decided that Mai-san will be cracked today.  
**Hiyori:** Well, what now? It should tell us which faction won.  
**Sayaka:** ......  
**App Announcer:** Mai-san's egg has been cracked. The Human faction has been completely eliminated. The Egg faction are the winners.  
**Sayaka:** ...!  
**Mai:** Fufu. Aww, we lost.  
**Mirja:** Well done, Itomi Sayaka.  
**Hiyori:** Yeah. Looks like I was right leaving it up to you.  
**Ellen:** Yes! Good job, Saaya! I'm so happy the Egg faction managed to win!  
**Kiyoka:** Thank you, Itomi-san! I had faith the Egg faction would make it!  
**Sayaka:** Ellen, Kiyoka... That's good. I'm glad everyone is happy with this.  
**Mihono:** You did great too, Mai. Nnn, I thought you would've have been able to pull it off though-.  
**Mai:** I thought I kept it hidden pretty well myself. Sayaka-chan, how did you tell I was a Human?  
**Sayaka:** Because... On the first day, you didn't help out Kanami.  
**Sayaka:** Since Kanami enjoys things with all her energy, it didn't seem strange that she would say something like that.  
**Sayaka:** And, Mai should know that better than anyone, but you didn't say anything. That's why, it seemed wrong to me.  
**Mai:** So that's why... Mm. When you put it like that, you're definitely right. When Kanami-chan said that, all I was thinking about was that we could crack her.  
**Sayaka:** Also, when you covered for Mihono.  
**Mai:** Eh? But, I explained the reason for that, didn't I?  
**Sayaka:** Mm. But, even though you covered for Mihono, you didn't cover for Kiyoka.  
**Sayaka:** But you would normally be worried about Kiyoka too, Mai. They were both suspicious, but you could have also cracked them the other way around.  
**Sayaka:** The time with Kanami, and the time with Kiyoka. Both times, you didn't look like you were acting like yourself to me. That's why I thought you were a Human.  
**Ellen:** Excellent! That's something only Saaya could tell, because of how much she adores Maimai!  
**Mai:** Mmhm. Sayaka-chan completely got the better of me.  
**Mirja:** ...By the way, which of you was the Rabbit? Was it Musumi Kiyoka, or Kohagura Ellen?  
**Kiyoka:** Right. That was me, Mirja-san.  
**Mihono:** Ehh!? It was you, Kiyoka!? I thought for sure it was either Ellen-san, since she's used to the game, or Mirja-san, since she's so good with strategies...  
**Mihono:** Wait? But, on the second day, didn't you ask for the Rabbit to "please protect Itomi-san tonight"?  
**Kiyoka:** Fufu, that was my strategy to make it seem like the Rabbit would still be alive, Hono-chan.  
**Mirja:** Then, that would mean, the question I remembered doubting was also...?  
**Kiyoka:** Ah, yes. That was part of my strategy too. I thought that, if I said that, the Human faction would avoid Itomi-san and go after Juujou-san instead, since she was the other innocent person.  
**Hiyori:** I see. So then, on the first night, I was the one who got targeted. And Kiyoka pulled a great move protecting me.  
**Kiyoka:** But then, because of that move, it also caused me to be suspected the following day... And, for that same reason, I couldn't come out as the Rabbit...  
**Mihono:** Uuu, either way, Kiyoka really pulled one over on us-. If we had been able to eat an Egg for the second day, I would have stayed quiet, and then I wouldn't have stood out so much-.  
**Mai:** We played right into Musumi-san's hand, didn't we, Mihono-chan.  
**Mirja:** With that, it's assured that the MVP of this game was Itomi Sayaka, who secured the victory. Musumi Kiyoka would be the shadow MVP.  
**Hiyori:** Definitely. You two really did great this time.  
**Kiyoka:** Ehehe. You're making me blush, complimenting me so much.  
**Sayaka:** But, everyone helped us to win. That's what I think.  
**Sayaka:** And also, it was a lot of fun.  
**Mihono:** Yeah. I think we feel the same.  
**Mai:** That's right. Even if we lost, it was fun playing on the Human faction.  
**Kanami:** U-Uuuu...  
**Hiyori:** What, Kanami? What are you crying about? Actually, how long have you been sitting there for?  
**Kanami:** Uwahhh-! That's no fair-! I wanted to keep on having fun playing the game too-!  
**Ellen:** Oh! Kanamin's frustration from retiring first is bursting out!  
**Sayaka:** ...Then, do you want to play again?  
**Kanami:** Eh? Can we? Great! This time for sure, I'll do a lot more!  
**Hiyori:** You're absolutely hopeless.
