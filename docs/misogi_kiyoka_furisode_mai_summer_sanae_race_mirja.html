That store's ramen is famous for its deliciousness!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Ramen?<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Yeah!<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> When it comes to noodles, I think mizusawa udon is the best, but I love ramen too!<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Every region does it pretty differently, so it's interesting to see.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> What sort of ramen do they have in Hokkaido?<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Miso ramen's definitely the most popular in Hokkaido, but they make tasty seafood flavored shio ramen too!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I'll look forward to it.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> The ramen was delicious.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Wasn't it? I wasn't sure what to pick first, but I made the right choice with shio ramen.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> As a token of my thanks for the ramen, I'll show you to a place I recommend.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Somewhere you recommend?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> That's right.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I thought I could also at least find one place to bring you, so I kept a special one in mind.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Woww... It's so pretty here...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I'm glad to see it's to your liking.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Why did you choose here...?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> It fit the image I have of you, Iwakura-san.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Sunflowers do suit you after all.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Sunflowers suit me...?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> They do. Sunflowers are a good fit for a toji with a straightforward, honest strength.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> ...Thank you.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> But, sunflowers really do suit you too, Konohana-san.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Fufu, that would be nice.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Anyway, it's about time we left.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> Ah, for the shinkansen?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> No, for the flight I chartered. This will be faster than taking the shinkansen, won't it?<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> ......Th-That's true.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> (Instead of sunflowers... maybe a more expensive flower would be better for Konohana-san.)<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> What are you waiting for? We're going.<br><strong>Sanae:</strong> R-Right...<br><a href="https://streamable.com/4bkhyw">https://streamable.com/4bkhyw</a></p><p><a href="https://streamable.com/jflgvk">https://streamable.com/jflgvk</a></p><h2 id="race-queen---mirja-start-a-favor" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Race Queen - Mirja: Start]: A Favor</h2><p><strong>Yui:</strong> My intuition's telling me she should be around here...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Ah, found her! Miiirja-saaan~!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Yamashiro Yui? As well as...<br><strong>Morishita Kihiro:</strong> Really-, we've been looking all over for you! Miss Kitora!<br><strong>Haji Keiko:</strong> H-Hello...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Morishita Kihiro and Haji Keiko. You three make a rare group.<br><strong>Kihiro:</strong> You might be right there!<br><strong>Kihiro:</strong> Though, despite myself coming from the equipment department and Miss Haji from the engineering preparatory department, we've long since deepened our friendship!<br><strong>Keiko:</strong> Eh!?  
<strong>Kihiro:</strong> But you're right that we have little in common with Miss Yamashiro here! ...What seems to be the matter, Miss Haji?<br><strong>Keiko:</strong> I-It's... nothing.<br><strong>Keiko:</strong> (Deepened... our friendship...?)<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> So then, did you need me for something?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Yes! Though, I'm not really the one looking for you; that's these two!<br><strong>Kihiro:</strong> What are you saying, Miss Yamashiro! With you offering your assistance, we're all of one heart and mind!<br><strong>Kihiro:</strong> In short! The three of us have one common cause!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ...Haji Keiko, please give me the essentials.<br><strong>Keiko:</strong> R-Right... Actually, we were thinking we wanted you to help with our assignment, Kitora-san...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Your assignment?<br><strong>Kihiro:</strong> As a matter of fact, we've been assigned to build one motorcycle!<br><strong>Kihiro:</strong> Soon enough, we'll be unveiling it to the public-- but as reasons go, we're lacking staff on that day! We'd very much like your help, Miss Kitora!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I'm not against helping you, but, sadly, I don't know much about motorcycles.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Why not ask someone more suited for this? Someone like Inago Akira should be up to the task.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Actually, we asked Boss, but she couldn't make it...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> You're the only one we can turn to, Mirja-san!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> And anyway, what we're missing is someone to help draw in visitors, so it's not like you even need to know about motorcycles!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ......<br><strong>All 3:</strong> Please help us!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ...Fine then. If you're that set on it, I'll help you out.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Hooray-! This is why I love you, Mirja-san!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Morishita Kihiro, Haji Keiko. Could you give me a specific schedule for the event?<br><strong>Kihiro:</strong> Sure thing! We're glad to have you, Miss Kitora! Really, what a stroke of luck, Miss Haji!<br><strong>Keiko:</strong> Y-Yes... But, err... No, it is lucky...<br><strong>Kihiro:</strong> We've done it, Miss Haji! Now we're 100% prepared for the unveiling!<br><strong>Keiko:</strong> Um, but... Is this really okay? I feel like we didn't tell her the important part...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Don't worry about it, Keiko-san! We don't have to tell her about "that" until just before we start!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Mufufu~! Ahh~, now I don't know how I'll wait for the day after tomorrow~!<br><strong>Keiko:</strong> (Is this really fine...?)  </p><h2 id="race-queen---mirja-end-day-of-the-unveiling" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Race Queen - Mirja: End]: Day of the Unveiling</h2><p><strong>Yui:</strong> Mirja-san! Can I be next to you on the way there? You don't mind, right!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Do what you want.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> More importantly, Morishita Kihiro. Let's go over once more what will happen when we get there.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Firstly, as I'm in charge of reaching out to visitors...<br><strong>Kihiro:</strong> Ahh, we lied about that.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Huh?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Hey!? It's too soon to spill the beans!!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ...Too soon to spill the beans. And what do you mean by that, Yamashiro Yui?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Well, uh, we didn't lie so much, Mirja-san. Loosely speaking, we do want you attracting visitors...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Haji Keiko?<br><strong>Keiko:</strong> M-Me!?  
<strong>Kihiro:</strong> Please don't glare at Miss Haji like that, Miss Kitora. She was saying we should give a proper explanation until the bitter end.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ...Right, I think I have an idea of what's going on. Yamashiro Yui is behind this, isn't she?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Teheh.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> "Teheh" doesn't make up for this.<br><strong>Kihiro:</strong> To give a perfectly crisp and clear explanation, we'd like you to be a race queen for us, Miss Kitora!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> A... race queen.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> So, what are you making me wear?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Ehehe! Take a look, Mirja-san! This is it!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> To sum it up... I wear this, sit on the motorcycle, and attract people...<br><strong>Kihiro:</strong> As a staff member attracting visitors in the broadest sense, you're our billboard.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ...<br><strong>Keiko:</strong> I-I'm sorry... We were actually going to hire a professional to do this...<br><strong>Kihiro:</strong> You see, while building the motorcycle, my gen~ius instincts went and caught fire.<br><strong>Kihiro:</strong> And, while remodeling here and there, we completely spent through our budget.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> That's when I happened to hear about all this, and thought, why not ask Mirja-san?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> With your bombshell body, there's no way you wouldn't look great in it!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ...Unbelievable.<br><strong>Keiko:</strong> Um... Are you not going to do it afer all...?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> No, I will. I wouldn't turn you down after coming this far. I'm not happy about it, but all I can do is resign myself to this...<br><strong>Cameraman:</strong> Excuse me-. Would you mind giving a look over this way-?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Li... like this?<br><strong>Cameraman:</strong> Thanks a lot! That's perfect!<br><strong>Man:</strong> Hey, check out the cowling on that bike...! The design, materials, functionality; they're all first rate.<br><strong>Woman:</strong> I can tell. And, the parts used here...! That's an interesting make, but what purpose does it serve? Hmm, I'd really like to find out.<br><strong>Kihiro:</strong> Mmhm! Just as we'd planned, Miss Haji! Our motorcycle is the center of attention!<br><strong>Kihiro:</strong> Now then! Let's hurry over and give our guests an explanation!<br><strong>Keiko:</strong> Right...! I'm very glad, that we worked so hard on this assignment...!<br>Mirja： (...From the sound of it, this motorcycle has incredible workmanship. That at least makes it worth me enduring the shame of dressing as a race queen.)</p><p><strong>Mirja:</strong> (Though--)<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Hey, Mirja-saan~! Could you look over my way too~! And be extra sexy for me, please~!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> (Sigh... Instead of guiding visitors, Yamashiro Yui is just enjoying herself.
