## 1: Let's Get Things Ready for the 24th!
**Yume:** Uhh, so first you break the eggs, then you separate the yolk from the egg white...? Wait, how are you supposed to do this anyway? Geez-, why doesn't this book explain things right?  
**Yume:** Since Yomi-onee-san's birthday is on the 24th, I was gonna surprise her by making a cake without going to Maki-onee-san or Suzuka-onee-san for help, but this is too hard!  
**Yume:** I can't tell what it's saying when it's just a book full of recipes-.  
**Mai:** Tsubakuro-san? What are you doing in here?  
**Yume:** O-Onee-san! That's what I should be asking you; what are you doing here?  
**Mai:** I'd thought about making some cookies for Sayaka-chan. These ingredients... Were you baking some sweets too, Tsubakuro-san?  
**Yume:** Yeah. I was getting ready for the 24th. I was thinking, after I call everyone over and the party starts, that's when I'll bring out a cake I made myself and really surprise Yomi-onee-san and everyone.  
**Mai:** (On the 24th... So a Christmas Eve party. I'm sure that if Tsubakuro-san did make a Christmas cake, everyone in the elite guard would be very surprised.)  
**Mai:** If it's alright with you, can we make it together?  
**Yume:** You'll do that?  
**Mai:** Of course I will. The 24th of December only comes around once a year, so we might as well make a big celebration out of it.  
**Yume:** Thanks! Oh, yeah! It'll be a bigger party if there's more people, so can you and your friends all come too?  
**Mai:** Can I? I'm glad you asked! Then, let's look forward to the 24th and do all we can to prepare together.  
**Yume:** Wow, I mixed it just like you said to, Onee-san, and now it's looking a lot more like cake batter!  
**Mai:** Fufu, you're a quick learner, Tsubakuro-san, so it's fun showing you how it's done.  
**Yume:** I'm figuring out what to do with the cake, but we have to get everything else ready too, don't we? Will you help me out with that too, Onee-san?  
**Mai:** Of course I will. Since we're going through with this, I want to make it as grand a party as I can!  
**Yume:** Hooray-!  
**Mai:** Since we've decided on that, I'd like to have more friends helping us with the rest. I'll try asking around.  
**Mihono:** A Christmas Eve party!? That sounds fun! Sure, I'll help!  
**Hiyori:** You might be right. It's not a bad idea bringing everyone together at the end of the year to celebrate. I'll lend a hand too.  
**Kaoru:** It sounds like too much work, but Ellen gets annoying bugging me to come help. I'll just get it over with and join you.  
**Mai:** Thank you, all of you! I'm going to go ask around some more, so I'll meet you in the cooking classroom later.  
**Yume:** Wow, you got all these people to help get the party ready?  
**Mai:** Yep, I told them I wanted to throw a big party for the occasion, and they all volunteered.  
**Kofuki:** Hey, I didn't volunteer or anything.  
**Tsugumi:** Shichinosato-san is here to work as payment for eating Kitora-san's share of pudding. Isn't that right?  
**Mirja:** That's correct. I'll have you repay this year's debts before the year is done. Now then, everyone, in order to welcome the 24th as best we can, let's get to work at once.  
**Mihono/Hiyori/Mai:** Yeah-!  
**Yume:** (I didn't think this many people would come help to celebrate Yomi-onee-san's birthday!)  
**Mai:** Tsubakuro-san? Is something the matter?  
**Yume:** I-It's nothing. Thanks for bringing everyone here, Onee-san. Let's throw a good party.  
**Mai:** Sure!  
**Announcement:** Aradama have appeared in the surrounding city, toji are to intercept at once. I repeat--  
**Yume:** Aradama!? Geez-, could they have picked a worse time to show up-?  
**Mai:** This sure is some bad timing. But still, if we want to make sure everyone can enjoy the party, we should finish our duties first.  
**Yume:** Yeah, I'm not letting them stop us no matter what! I'll take them all out in a second!  

## 2: The Two Slightly Off the Same Page
**Mai:** It's a good thing those aradama were dealt with safely, isn't it.  
**Yume:** Yeah. I punished them as good as I could, so hopefully they don't show up anymore...  
**Mai:** Hm? By the way, did you see Mihono-chan and the others? Where could they have gone.  
**Mirja:** Asakura Mihono said she was going to practice her singing, and she took Ban Tsugumi and Shichinosato Kofuki with her to the music room.  
**Yume:** (Singing? ...Oh, that makes sense. The happy birthday song is a really important part of birthdays. I'm happy they'd go as far as to practice singing it!)  
**Yume:** We can't have the party without singing, after all!  
**Mai:** That's true. This will definitely help liven up the party.  
**Mai:** (Fufu, a choir singing carols? It's so Christmas-y that I can't wait to hear it! We'll have to get Santa and reindeer themed outfits ready for people too.)  
**Mai:** Kitora-san, can I ask you to take care of costumes?  
**Yume:** Costumes!? You're going to get stuff like that for the party too?  
**Mirja:** Since we're putting on this party, I'd like to do all we can to make it extravagant. I'll go ahead and work on providing the costumes then.  
**Mai:** Now it's just the two of us again, Tsubakuro-san. In the meantime, how about we continue working on preparing the cake and feast?  
**Yume:** Sure-!  
**Yomi:** There you are, Tsubakuro-san.  
**Yume:** Y-Yomi-onee-san!  
**Yume:** (No way, why is she here? What do I do... If she finds out I'm making a cake, the surprise'll be... I need to fool her, but how, umm...)  
**Mai:** If you have a moment, Satsuki-san, what sort of Christmas songs do you like?  
**Yume:** Huh? Christmas songs?  
**Yomi:** None in particular... If I had to say something, I prefer them to have a peaceful melody, as it's calming.  
**Yume:** (Oh, I get it! She asked her something totally unrelated to naturally move away from the cake! Onee-san's good at this.)  
**Yomi:** That aside, Tsubakuro-san, Yukari-sama is calling for you. Please return to Yukari-sama's quarters at once.  
**Yume:** Eh-, do I have to go right now? I'm kind of in the middle of something though...  
**Mai:** If the head of the Origami family is calling for you, you'll just have to go. I'll take care of the rest, so you should go see her, Tsubakuro-san.  
**Yume:** Okaaay. I'm going then.  
**Yume:** I'll be back as soon as I can, so you have to keep the surprise a secret from Yomi-onee-san, okay?  
**Yomi:** You look like you're preparing for something. Would you like me to assist you?  
**Mai:** (Tsubakuro-san said she wanted to keep the fact that she's making a cake a secret from the elite guard... I know! I'll distract her by asking her to take care of something else.)  
**Mai:** Satsuki-san, could you help with getting the feast ready at the kitchen counter over there? We're doing the cooking for a Christmas Eve celebration party.  
**Yomi:** I see, so that's what you were preparing for. I understand. If you need celebratory food, red bean rice is a must have.  
**Yume:** I'm baaack~! Wait, huh? Why is Yomi-onee-san doing the cooking!?  
**Mai:** Eh? Tsubakuro-san, what's wrong? Why do you look so panicked?  
**Yume:** What about you, Onee-san!? Why are you acting so calm about this! I mean, the party on the 24th is for...  
**Announcement:** Aradama have appeared, aradama have appeared. Toji are to intercept at once. I repeat--  
**Yume:** And why do aradama have to show up now!? Geez-, we have to get things ready as fast as we can!  
**Mai:** There's nothing we can do about them appearing this often. Let's all combine our efforts to deal with them again.  
**Yume:** Boo-. If I have to then-. Let's go right away then.  
**Yomi:** Please wait a moment. There isn't much time left before the 24th, so Tsubakuro-san, please stay here and continue working on the party preparations.  
**Yume:** Huh?  
**Yomi:** Let's leave, Yanase-san.  
**Mai:** Right!  
**Yume:** It's Yomi-onee-san's own birthday party, but, asking me to please work on the preparations, she must be super excited for it! Was she always like that?  
**Yume:** But, more importantly, the surprise got out! Onee-san couldn't keep her mouth shut~! What should I do now-!?  

## 3: The Outcome of the Surprise...
On the day of the party.

  
**Suzuka:** As one might expect, after spreading the word to toji throughout the Five Traditions, there's quite a number of people here tonight.  
**Maki:** By the way, I haven't seen Yume anywhere in a while. Do you know where she went?  
**Yomi:** If you're looking for Tsubakuro-san, she's shut herself up in the cooking classroom getting things ready for the party.  
**Suzuka:** Yume is cooking? That's rather surprising.  
**Mai:** Tsubakuro-san, I've started decorating the cake, but would you like to do it together with me?  
**Yume:** No thanks. There's other things I have to do...  
**Mai:** (Tsubakuro-san seems to be in sort of a bad mood, but I wonder why...)  
**Yume:** Sigh... It might not be a surprise anymore, but I've gotta at least make a sign that goes on top of the cake...  
**Yume:** Uhh, I'll take this big cookie, and write on top with a chocolate pen, "Happy Birthday, Yomi-onee-san." There...  
**Mai:** Tsubakuro-san, I've finished decorating the cake, so will you come check how it turned out? I tried making it look a little fancy, but what do you think?  
**Yume:** Ehhh!? This is just a Christmas cake!  
**Mai:** Eh? Yes... It is a Christmas cake. ...Wait? Tsubakuro-san, what did you write on that cookie...  
**Mai:** Wait, don't tell me, is today Satsuki-san's birthday!?  
**Yume:** Ehh-!? You helped me out without even knowing that? Didn't I tell you at the start, we're doing a celebration party on the 24th...  
**Yume:** Ahhh! Wait, Onee-san, did you think we were doing a party celebrating Christmas Eve!?  
**Mai:** I-I did. You mentioned the 24th, so I was sure you meant Christmas Eve...  
**Mai:** I see now. So that's why it sometimes felt like we were talking about two different things. I'm sorry, I gave myself the wrong idea, and even had Satsuki-san herself help with it.  
**Yume:** No, it's not your fault then. I'm sorry too, for getting upset with you.  
**Mai:** It's alright. I feel much better now that that mystery is cleared up. But still, what are we going to do about the cake? I gave it the most Christmas-y decorations I could come up with.  
**Yume:** Hmm, there's not a lot of time left, so if we get rid of the Santa decoration and put this cookie on, it'll look a little more like a birthday cake. I'm taking the Santa off.  
**Mai:** Wait! Just leave the cookie where it is for now! I just came up with a good idea.  
**Yume:** A good idea?  
**Mai:** If we take advantage of the situation, we can still surprise Satsuki-san.  
**Yume:** Wait, what? What do you mean-? I don't really get it, but this sounds fun!  
**Mirja:** Now, everyone, the Christmas cake you've all been waiting for is ready to be presented! This cake was made with the combined efforts of Tsubakuro Yume and Yanase Mai.  
**Yume:** Tadah! Look, look! Me and Onee-san made this cake together!  
**Mai:** I only helped with it a little, so first, we'd like for the elite guard to have a taste of the cake Tsubakuro-san made herself.  
**Maki:** Yume made a cake by herself!? I can't believe it.  
**Suzuka:** So this was the big surprise she was excited about. It's very well made.  
**Yomi:** Yes, I never would have thought Tsubakuro-san could make such a fine cake. I'm surprised.  
**Yume:** Ehehe, you're surprised? But you know, the best part is what's next?  
**Maki:** A blackout!?  
**Yomi:** An aradama might be responsible. I'll get my okatana at once...  
**Yume:** You don't have to do any of that-. Onee-sans, are you ready? One, two-!  
**Tsugumi/Mihono/Kofuki:** Happy birthday to you~. Happy birthday to you~. Happy birthday, dear...  
**Yume:** Yomi-onee-san~. Happy birthday to you~.  
**Suzuka:** Oh my, Yomi-san! On top of the Christmas cake, there's a big birthday message!  
**Yomi:** Wasn't this a Christmas Eve party today?  
**Yume:** Hooray-! The surprise was a big success!  
**Mai:** Mmhm! Isn't that great, Tsubakuro-san.  
**Mirja:** Thanks to the mixup between Yanase Mai and Tsubakuro Yume, Satsuki Yomi was brought here under the pretense of a Christmas party, and the surprise was highly successful. It may have been accidental, but it played out perfectly.  
**Yomi:** Everyone, I'm sorry you had to do all this for my sake. This can be a Christmas party from here on out, so I hope you can enjoy yourselves as you planned...  
**Yume:** There's no backing out of it, Yomi-onee-san-. Tonights stars are you and all the Santas, right?  
**Mai:** That's right. This is a birthday party and a Christmas Eve party. We have an outfit ready for you too, Satsuki-san. Here, please get changed!  
**Suzuka:** My, and how adorable it is! It would fit Yomi-san perfectly. Eh? You have one for me as well? Come along, Yomi-san, let's get changed.  
**Mihono:** Satsuki-san and them finished changing, so, after the birthday song, our choir is gonna sing Christmas carols!  
**Mirja:** Will those of you in reindeer and Santa outfits come forward. Now, let's all have a dance!  
**Yume:** Kyahaha-! That Santa outfit looks really good on you, Yomi-onee-san!  
**Mai:** She seemed to have no idea, so the surprise was a big success, wasn't it?  
**Yume:** Yeah! Onee-san, thanks a bunch. And also, Merry Christmas!

## 4: Kanami and Hiyori's Christmas Eve
**Kanami:** That was a fun party, wasn't it! And you were so cute dressed up like a reindeer, Hiyori-chan. See, look! I took a ton of pictures!  
**Hiyori:** Kh, you took so many so fast it's practically a video... What were you even going to do with all these photos?  
**Kanami:** You were too cute, so I just had to. Ahh~, I'm having such a good time it's gonna be hard coming back down to reality-.  
**Kanami:** I've got it! If we go out around town, the Christmas lights might be up! Hiyori-chan, let's go check it out together.  
**Hiyori:** You want to do a walk through the night? Well, that doesn't sound so bad.  
**Hiyori:** There's not a single sign of Christmas down this street.  
**Kanami:** Uuuu, who'd have thought even here would still be the same as usual...  
**Kanami:** Sorry about this, Hiyori-chan. I made you come out with me and all...  
**Hiyori:** You don't have to mind me.  
**Kanami:** Still... I thought I'd finally get to enjoy something Christmas-y with you. Uuu...  
**Hiyori:** Kanami... Guess I might as well do it now. I was going to leave this by your pillow tomorrow morning, but... Here. This is for you.  
**Kanami:** A cute box with a ribbon on it... Hiyori-chan, what is this?  
**Hiyori:** Y... Your Christmas present. I had to give something back for all the help you're always giving me.  
**Kanami:** Eh-- A Christmas present from Hiyori-chan!? For me? Can I have it? I can really have it?  
**Hiyori:** I said it's for you, so just take it already. It might not seem like anything special either...  
**Kanami:** No way; I'll be happy no matter what I get from you, Hiyori-chan.  
**Kanami:** And, besides...  
**Hiyori:** Kanami? What are you looking all flustered for now?  
**Kanami:** (I never even thought about a Christmas present. What should I do... Umm, what can I come up with quick at a time like this...)  
**Kanami:** Oh, right! I can do that! Let's see, I'll take a notepad and colored marker...  
**Hiyori:** What's going on, Kanami? You just started writing a note out of nowhere...  
**Kanami:** And done-! Here you go, Hiyori-chan! This is my Christmas present to you! It's a ticket to have a sparring match anytime.  
**Hiyori:** Heh...  
**Kanami:** Huh? Normally you'd say something to make fun of me there.  
**Hiyori:** Go ahead and open the box I gave you.  
**Kanami:** What's in it? Umm...  
**Kanami:** No way-! It's a handwritten "We'll have a sparring match whenever you want" ticket!  
**Kanami:** That's crazy! We both thought up the same thing on our own. That kinda makes me happy.  
**Hiyori:** I couldn't think of anything Christmas like to give you.  
**Kanami:** Then, let's use these and do something Christmas like! Come on, hurry, hurry-!  
**Hiyori:** H-Hey, Kanami! Don't grab my hand and start running like that! It's dangerous.  
**Hiyori:** This is...  
**Kanami:** Last year, they had this big tree decorated here, so I thought maybe they did it again! It's as pretty as last year...  
**Hiyori:** It sure is. I thought that, wherever you go around Christmas, there'd be people everywhere, but there isn't a single person here before us. It's nice and quiet.  
**Kanami:** It feels a little strange, doesn't it? Spending Christmas Eve alone together at the place where we first met.  
**Hiyori:** Heh... That's true...  
**Kanami:** Anyway, let's get right to our match! Are you ready to go, Hiyori-chan?  
**Hiyori:** Sure, I'm ready for you anytime.  
**Kanami:** (A sparring session all alone with Hiyori-chan, lit under the light of a Christmas tree! This turned into the best Christmas ever.)  

## 5: Maki and Suzuka's Christmas Eve
**Maki:** Today was a completely unexpected surprise. What a nice party this was.  
**Suzuka:** It was. It should make for a good report to Yukari-sama. Hm? But where did the star of the night, Yomi-san go off to?  
**Yume:** Yomi-onee-san said she was too tired from people celebrating her, so she left as soon as the party was over.  
**Maki:** I see. Then, it's about time we excused ourselves too.  
**Yume:** I want to help those onee-sans clean up until the end, so you go back without me, Maki-onee-san, Suzuka-onee-san. I'll see you later.  
**Maki:** It's just you and me now. Why don't we head home?  
**Suzuka:** H-Hang on a moment. Maki-san, it is the night of Christmas Eve, so why not go and see some Christmas lights?  
**Maki:** Christmas lights?  
**Suzuka:** Yes. It's a bit out of the way, but I know of an incredibly beautiful spot.  
**Maki:** Sure, it's not a bad idea to take detours from time to time. Let's go see it together.  
**Suzuka:** Oh my! What a happy accident, that the lights were so much more elaborate than I had thought.  
**Maki:** You were right, it really is beautiful... Though, I didn't expect to see this big a crowd at night in the middle of winter.  
**Maki:** Suzuka, be careful so we don't lose each other...  
**Maki:** And as soon as I said that, she's already gone. Suzuka! Oiii, Suzuka!  
**Suzuka:** Maki-san, what's the matter? You were shouting my name so loudly.  
**Maki:** Well, you just went and vanished on me... With all these people around us, we might get separated again. Here, hold onto my hand.  
**Suzuka:** Eh-- Maki-san...?  
**Maki:** What's wrong, Suzuka? Your face is red.  
**Suzuka:** Th-That's only... It's only because of the reflection of the lights!  
**Maki:** Uh, none of the lights around here are red. Ah-- Don't tell me, did you start catching a cold?  
**Suzuka:** No, that's not the case...  
**Maki:** We can't afford to ignore colds this time of year. Let's check right away to see if you've got a fever. Suzuka, let me see your forehead.  
**Suzuka:** Ma-Maki-san!  
**Suzuka:** (Right in front of all these people...)  
**Maki:** What is it? If you don't hold still, it's hard for me to tell.  
**Suzuka:** ...........................  
**Maki:** Hmm... It feels like you maybe have a little bit of a fever.  
**Maki:** We can't let it get worse, with the night wind blowing on you. Here, I'll lend you my scarf.  
**Suzuka:** No, that won't be necessary. This fever isn't being caused by a cold...  
**Maki:** There's no point in holding back now. Here, I'll wrap you up in it.  
**Maki:** Okay, there you go. We've had our fill of the Christmas lights, so why don't we get you home?  
**Maki:** It looks like the crowds keep going up ahead. Be sure not to let go of my hand.  
**Suzuka:** O-Of course.  
**Maki:** The north winds sure are blowing strong today.  
**Suzuka:** I'm perfectly warm wrapped in your scarf, but are you feeling cold, Maki-san?  
**Maki:** Oh, I'll be fine. I've got the heat of your hand keeping me warm.  
**Suzuka:** Honestly...  
**Suzuka:** (This year's Christmas Eve will be a fine thing to remember. I'll have to offer my gratitude to Santa Claus...)
