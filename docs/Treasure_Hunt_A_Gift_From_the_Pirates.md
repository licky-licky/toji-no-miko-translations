## 1: Want to Hunt For Treasure?
**Mihono/Kanami:** The sea-!!  
**Hiyori:** Don't get too worked up about it, Kanami, Mihono. We only came to this island to do our mission.  
**Kanami/Mihono:** We're sorry...  
**Hiyori:** Honestly; you say something to them too, Kiyoka.  
**Kiyoka:** ...  
**Hiyori:** What's wrong, Kiyoka?  
**Kiyoka:** There's pirates...  
**Hiyori:** What about pirates?  
**Kiyoka:** On this island, there's a legend about pirates! After we finish our mission, we should go looking for treasure!  
**Kiyoka:** Did you know? This place here used to be called The Pirates' Cove too!  
**Hiyori:** You're getting worked up too!  
**Kiyoka:** Ahaha, sorry about that. But, I'll take the mission seriously.  
**Hiyori:** You'd better.  
**Kanami:** Come on, Hiyori-chan. Searching for treasure is bound to be fun!  
**Mihono:** I wonder what the pirates' treasure was like? Probably chests of gold and stuff!  
**Hiyori:** If we found something like that, it'd only bring us trouble.  
**Mihono:** Geez, you've gotta dream a little, Juujou-san.  
**Kiyoka:** She's right!  
**Kiyoka:** Hono-chan has a weird affect on things sometimes! We might actually find it!  
**Kiyoka:** Yeah, yeah... Wait, Kiyoka!?  
**Hiyori:** ...Good grief.  
**Hiyori:** There's no way you'd stumble across it that easy. Anyway, we should get moving. We have to get a map of the island first.  
**Kanami:** Getting a map of the island; you're pretty into this too, Hiyori-chan!  
**Hiyori:** Wha--!? I am not!?  
**Hiyori:** I was just thinking we'd need a map to end this mission as smoothly as possible is all!  
**Kiyoka:** Right! We'll end it as smoothly as possible, then search for treasure!  
**Mihono:** Okaaay! Let's go get that map-!  
**Kanami/Kiyoka:** Yeah-!  
**Hiyori:** Are you even listening to me!?  
**Mihono:** Where do you think we could get a map at?  
**Kiyoka:** We could look online, but I'd want to have a physical map.  
**Hiyori:** If we check the island's information center, they should have one, right?  
**Kanami:** Good thinking, Hiyori-chan! Let's check the information center!  
**Kanami:** Hello-.  
**Information Center Staff:** Yes, how can I help you?  
**Mihono:** We were thinking of looking for the pirate treasure! So, we wanted a map for it; do you have one?  
**Hiyori:** You're getting things mixed up, Mihono! What happened to dealing with the suppression mission first!  
**Mihono:** Ah.  
**Information Center Staff:** Would you girls happen to be the toji who were requested to take care of the aradama?  
**Kanami:** Yep, that's us!  
**Hiyori:** We might have given you a bad impression, but rest assured. We're all highly capable toji.  
**Information Center Staff:** No, you didn't give a bad impression at all. Please just wait here a moment.  
**Kiyoka:** They went off into the back... I wonder what they're doing?  
**Hiyori:** Maybe they're checking with the Sword Administration Bureau to see if we're actually toji, after what Mihono said.  
**Mihono:** Because of me!?  
**Information Center Staff:** Sorry to keep you waiting. You can have this map.  
**Hiyori:** This map... it's hand-drawn?  
**Information Center Staff:** Yes. I was told that, if toji arrive here, I should give them this map.  
**Kanami:** This has gotta be a treasure map!  
**Mihono:** Thanks a lot! Guys, let's go check out the place drawn on here!  
**Hiyori:** Stop! We're doing the suppression mission first!  
**Hiyori:** Though... I never expected something like an actual treasure map would turn up.  
**Hiyori:** Even I'm getting a little excited now.  

## 2: The Pirates' Cherry Tree
**Mihono:** We finished the mission, so let's start the treasure hunt! Let's go see the place on the map!  
**Kanami:** Hiyori-chan, get the map out!  
**Hiyori:** Quit shaking me!  
**Hiyori:** I'll get it out in a second, so just hold still. Umm... This is a pretty lousy map.  
**Hiyori:** It at least says, "Under the pirates' cherry tree"...  
**Kanami:** The pirates' cherry tree?  
**Mihono:** Ooh, that sounds kinda cool!  
**Kiyoka:** I wish we'd come during cherry blossom season. I bet it would have looked beautiful.  
**Hiyori:** According to the map... It's that way? Let's go.  
**All 3:** Okaaay~.  
**Hiyori:** The map says it should be here...  
**Kiyoka:** In this park... Let me look it up for a minute.  
**Mihono:** You think there's a pirates' cherry tree here?  
**Kanami:** Hmmm, I don't see any trees that look like they're the one, do you? Maybe we should ask somebody.  
**Kiyoka:** Wait, Etou-san.  
**Kiyoka:** I did find an article about the pirates' cherry tree, but... it looks like it was chopped down five years ago.  
**Kiyoka:** It says it was the end of its lifespan...  
**Kanami:** Oh, huh. That's sort of disappointing...  
**Hiyori:** ...At the very least, this map had to have been written over five years ago.  
**Mihono:** What if it really is a treasure map!  
**Kanami:** This is getting exciting!  
**Hiyori:** So then, Kiyoka. What happened with the cherry tree?  
**Kiyoka:** It looks like the tree stump should still be in the middle of the park.  
**Hiyori:** Then, we should still have the right place.  
**Mihono:** Let's go, Kiyoka!  
**Kiyoka:** Ah! Wait for me, Hono-chan!  
**Kanami:** We should go too, Hiyori-chan.  
**Hiyori:** I'll go ask permission, just in case. You go ahead.  
**Kanami:** Okay!  
**Hiyori:** Did you find the stump?  
**Kanami:** Right here, Hiyori-chan... Hey, what have you got there?  
**Hiyori:** They lent me spades.  
**Kiyoka:** Great going, Juujou-san!  
**Mihono:** Cool! Let's dig up under the pirates' cherry tree stump!  
**Mihono:** Hmm, nothing over here. What about you guys?  
**Kiyoka:** I didn't find anything either. Just how deep do you think it's buried?  
**Kanami:** Maybe it's buried reaaally deep or something.  
**Hiyori:** ...No, it shouldn't be that hard to get. It's probably...  
**Hiyori:** Ah.  
**Mihono:** What's up, Juujou-san?  
**Hiyori:** My spade hit something.  
**Kiyoka:** Really!?  
**Kanami:** Let me see, Hiyori-chan!  
**Hiyori:** Don't all of you come over here at once!  
**Hiyori:** There's a box and a map, it looks like. The box... is locked and won't open.  
**Mihono:** The next map, and a box we can't open! It's turning more into a treasure hunt!  
**Hiyori:** You're not wrong. Though, I don't think this chest has the gold you're hoping for.  
**Mihono:** Eh?  
**Hiyori:** ...Wait, let me put that better. This was definitely something buried here for toji to find, don't you think?  
**Hiyori:** But, I don't think this is something that impressive. When the park manager handed me the spades, I was sure of it.  
**Kiyoka:** ...Ah, the manager must've known this box was buried just deep enough that we could dig it out with these.  
**Hiyori:** It's a natural conclusion.  
**Hiyori:** ...So, do you want to keep going?  
**Kiyoka:** ......  
**Kanami:** ...I'll keep going.  
**Kanami:** I mean, when they gave us the map, it was because we're toji, right? When you got the spades, did they try to stop you, Hiyori-chan?  
**Hiyori:** ...No, they told me to try our best.  
**Kanami:** Then, we should keep going! We'll find the treasure together!  
**Mihono:** I'm with Kanami!  
**Mihono:** I don't know why whoever hid the treasure did it, but they made treasure maps and came up with all this, right?  
**Mihono:** So I'm sure they must've wanted whoever came here looking for treasure to have fun finding it!  
**Kiyoka:** Do you think so?  
**Mihono:** I know it!  
**Mihono:** But still, who could've buried the treasure here anyway?  
**Hiyori:** There's a good chance this was just someone's idea of killing time back then.  
**Hiyori:** Anyway, let's keep going with the treasure hunt. The next destination is... "Follow the legend of the pirates"?  

## 3: The Pirates' Treasure
**Islander A:** The legend of the pirates? Let me see that map for a second... Alright. That's probably what they mean.  
**Islander B:** Ahh, I get it. The shrine, right? That old story about the girl who fought to protect the island from pirates.  
**Islander C:** You want to know what happened to the girl? She won in fighting off the pirates, but she passed on from her wounds then.  
**Islander C:** Nowadays, she's enshrined at a shrine here on the island. If you're looking to go there, see, you can take that bus.  
**Kiyoka:** ...  
**Mihono:** We made it to the shrine, but... Where do you think the next map is?  
**Kiyoka:** ...  
**Hiyori:** What's wrong, Kiyoka?  
**Kiyoka:** Nothing... It's just, I've been thinking about the pirate legend this whole time.  
**Kiyoka:** About the girl who protected the island from the pirates. And, why was it a girl?  
**Kanami:** What do you mean?  
**Kiyoka:** They were pirates, weren't they?  
**Kiyoka:** It would be a more standard story if the girl were kidnapped, but the girl is the one who fought them. Don't you think that's a little odd?  
**Kanami:** Is it?  
**Mihono:** Well, we fight too.  
**Kiyoka:** Exactly! That's what I mean, Hono-chan!  
**Mihono:** Uwah!? Wh-What do you mean!?  
**Kiyoka:** Basically, the pirates in the legend; what if they were aradama?  
**Hiyori:** Hmm. That's an interesting way of thinking about it. I think it's possible enough.  
**Hiyori:** You're right that, when you rethink it as a toji fighting to protect the island from aradama, it lines up.  
**Mihono:** But then... That means there was a toji here who was lost fighting aradama, right...?  
**Kanami:** Would that mean, the pirates' treasure is the okatana that toji was using?  
**Kiyoka:** I think that could be it.  
**Mihono:** Then, we should find that okatana! We'll bring it back with us!  
**Hiyori:** Calm down a minute.  
**Hiyori:** We're only talking about how the old pirate legend could have been like that.  
**Hiyori:** But we're saying the treasure we're looking for right now isn't connected to the legend.  
**Mihono:** Ah, it's not...?  
**Hiyori:** At any rate, this should definitely be the place the last map marked.  
**Hiyori:** Let's look around to see if there's another map here.  
**Kiyoka:** We should ask the shrine's priest if they know something. Maybe they'll be familiar with it, like at the park.  
**Priest:** Yes, I know about it. Back then, a toji who came to our island to suppress aradama left me with a key.  
**Priest:** I'll bring it to you, so please give me a moment.  
**Hiyori:** ...So was this toji who came here on a mission the one who made the maps...?  
**Kanami:** I wasn't expecting to hear that.  
**Hiyori:** ...Well, it could happen.  
**Priest:** Here it is, this here.  
**Mihono:** Um, I just want to make sure of something... That toji, did she get hurt or anything on her mission...?  
**Priest:** Not at all; she was finished with the aradama before we knew it, then went back home.  
**Mihono:** That's good then!  
**Kanami:** Thank you very much for getting the key for us! The toji who left it with you, what was she like?  
**Priest:** What was she like... It was twenty years ago, so... Hmm.  
**Kanami:** You can't remember after all?  
**Priest:** Maybe so... Well, come to think of it...  
**Priest:** There were two of them, and they might have reminded me of you two.  
**Kanami:** Me and...  
**Hiyori:** Me?  
**Kanami:** Hiyori-chan, you think that means...?  
**Hiyori:** Probably.  
**Mihono:** Eh? Eh? It's no fair that you're the only ones who get it!  
**Mihono:** Right, Kiyoka!  
**Kiyoka:** I think you're just terrible at picking up on things, Hono-chan...  
**Mihono:** Wait, so I'm the only one who doesn't get it!?  
**Hiyori:** I'm opening the box.  
**Hiyori:** This is... Well, it isn't a map. There's something written on it.  
**Hiyori:** ..."A match at the Pirates' Cove at sundown".  
**Mihono:** So in the end, we came back here. And... what are we supposed to do now?  
**Kanami:** It said "a match", so isn't it telling us to fight off here on the beach?  
**Hiyori:** Then let's give it a shot. Get ready, Kanami.  
**Kanami:** Sure thing, Hiyori-chan!  
**Kiyoka:** Um, I think that might be wrong...  
**Kanami/Hiyori:** Huh?  
**Kiyoka:** See, doesn't this come up a lot? There's a point where the shadows reach as the sun sets, that kind of thing.  
**Kiyoka:** Those boulders there, their shadows look suspicious.  
**Mihono:** Nice going, Kiyoka! That's what you get, reading those books all the time! Umm, the sun's that way, so the shadows go... Here!  
**Hiyori:** I get it, their shadows do look like they're dueling.  
**Kanami:** Let's go check it out!  
**Kanami:** This is the spot. I'll dig it up.  
**Kanami:** ...There it is.  
**Hiyori:** ...  
**Mihono:** This one really looks like a treasure box. Hey, can I open it?  
**Kiyoka:** Don't do that, Hono-chan. Etou-san and Juujou-san have to be the ones to open this.  
**Mihono:** Huh?  
**Kanami:** I'm opening it.  
**Kanami:** ...There's two letters inside.  
**Kanami:** "To me ten years from now... Minato."  
**Hiyori:** Let me see the other one.  
**Hiyori:** This says, "To myself ten years from now, Kagari." It's my mom's.  
**Kanami:** It's a time capsule left by our mothers.  

## 4: To Us in Ten Years
**Kagari:** A time capsule?  
**Minato:** Yeah, a time capsule!  
**Minato:** See, this island has that legend about the pirates, right? So then, wouldn't it be fun to bury a time capsule? Like it's a treasure hunt.  
**Kagari:** Huh?  
**Kagari:** If it's a treasure hunt, wouldn't we also be the ones finding it after its hidden? That's only making a mystery we already know the solution to.  
**Minato:** It'll be fine. A decade from now, I bet we'll have forgotten.  
**Kagari:** A decade...  
**Minato:** Yep, a whole decade.  
**Minato:** Ten years from now, let's come back and dig this up together, Kagari.  
**Kagari:** ......  
**Minato:** Don't want to?  
**Minato:** I think it'll definitely be fun though... We could talk about how things used to be like and stuff while we look for it again.  
**Kagari:** Leaving aside whether or not it's fun, what you're saying is I'll still be together with you ten years from now, Minato-senpai.  
**Minato:** You sure will.  
**Kagari:** ...Sigh.  
**Kagari:** (But, ten years from now...)  
**Kagari:** (No. If I can dig it up in ten years... That wouldn't be so bad.)  
**Kagari:** (If that much time can have passed...)  
**Kagari:** Fine then. I'm not sure if I'll still be cleaning up after you in ten years, but I'll join you for this.  
**Minato:** Awesomeee!  
**Kagari:** Please don't get excited about this like a little kid.  
**Kagari:** So, what are we putting inside the time capsule?  
**Minato:** Let's see... We can't not put in letters; that's a must-have for time capsules.  
**Minato:** After that, we can just throw in photos or shells or something, right?  
**Kagari:** Just throw them in...  
**Minato:** Leaving letters is plenty already.  
**Minato:** For what we write on them, "To me ten years from now" is sure to do it.  
**Kagari:** Fine. Then, I'll write, "Thank you for putting up with being forced around by Minato-senpai even after ten years."  
**Minato:** Ehh, am I really forcing you around?  
**Kagari:** You force me around more than enough.  
**Kagari:** (...Now then.)  
**Kagari:** (There's no point in writing a letter to myself ten years from now. The next time you come to this island... I'm sure I won't be here.)  
**Kagari:** (So... I'll write my letter to Minato-senpai instead.)  
**Kagari:** (Minato-senpai, even after I'm gone from the world, I hope you can still stay the same as you've always been...)  
**Minato:** Kagari, if you're done writing, let me see!  
**Kagari:** You can't see it.  
**Kagari:** (...I can't even picture what she would look like depressed.)  
**Kagari:** (Ten years from now, she'll surely have that same smile on her face.)  

## 5: Our Own Time Capsule
**Kanami:** It's a time capsule left by our mothers.  
**Mihono:** Ehhh!?  
**Mihono:** Why would a time capsule from your mothers be buried here!?  
**Hiyori:** Like they said at the shrine, the toji who came here suppressing aradama twenty years ago must have been Minato-san and my mom.  
**Hiyori:** Though, a time capsule... I didn't think my mom would do something like that.  
**Kanami:** I'm just guessing, but maybe my mother's the one who suggested it? I can see her saying, "It'll be fun!"  
**Hiyori:** So Minato-san pushed my mom into doing it.  
**Kanami:** That sort of reminds me of you, Hiyori-chan.  
**Hiyori:** How so?  
**Kanami:** Because in the end, you still came along on this treasure hunt with us.  
**Hiyori:** Urgh...  
**Mihono:** Hey, besides the letters, it looks like there's other stuff in here.  
**Kiyoka:** Seashells and a photo?  
**Kiyoka:** Ah, this photo...  
**Kanami:** It's a photo of my mother and Kagari-san!  
**Hiyori:** ...  
**Hiyori:** ...Mom looks like she's in a bad mood.  
**Mihono:** Does she? To me, it looks like she's enjoying it...  
**Hiyori:** You think so?  
**Mihono:** Yeah! After all, you make that same face sometimes, Juujou-san!  
**Hiyori:** ...  
**Kiyoka:** So... what should we do with these?  
**Mihono:** Should we open up the letters?  
**Kanami/Hiyori:** ......  
**Kanami/Hiyori:** Nah./No.  
**Kanami:** I get the feeling this isn't something I should read. The next time I visit her grave, I'll bring this with me.  
**Hiyori:** I'll do the same.  
**Hiyori:** For a souvenir... This photo is more than enough.  
**Mihono:** Alright... Yeah! That's just fine!  
**Kiyoka:** It feels kind of like fate, for their daughters to find the time capsule their mothers buried...  
**Kanami:** It does...  
**Kanami:** Our mothers saw this exact same view...  
**Hiyori:** ...We won't find a better treasure than this.  
**Kiyoka:** Juujou-san, that sounded a little corny...  
**Hiyori:** What!?  
**Kanami:** Ahahaha!  
**Mihono:** I know! I came up with a good idea! We should bury a time capsule of our own too!  
**Mihono:** And then, we can get somebody to dig it up twenty years from now!  
**Kanami:** Yeah, that sounds neat!  
**Kiyoka:** It doesn't feel like a time capsule anymore, if you're having someone else dig it up...  
**Hiyori:** Then we'll just have to be the ones to come dig it up ourselves.  
**Hiyori:** Let's think about what we want to bury.  
**Mihono/Kiyoka:** Okaaay!  
**Kanami:** ...  
**Hiyori:** What's wrong, Kanami?  
**Kanami:** Nothing...  
**Kanami:** Just thinking, I'm really glad I got put on this mission.
