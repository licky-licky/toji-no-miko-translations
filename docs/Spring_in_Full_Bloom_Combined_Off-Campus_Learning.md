## 1: Off-Campus Learning!
**Kanami:** Finally, today we're doing off-campus learning! I've been waiting for this-!  
**Mihono:** Right! I've been so excited! What's off campus learning about, anyway?  
**Hiyori:** You don't even know that, and yet you were still excited...?  
**Mihono:** I really like the word "off-campus"! I'm not a fan of the word "learning" though...  
**Chie:** Putting it simply, off-campus learning is like a field trip. Twelve of us toji were let off duty to see the famous places around Yokohama.  
**Mihono:** But I counted us up and there's only eleven people here? It's past the meeting time too.  
**Ellen:** ...Sorry~! I was running late~!  
**Kanami:** Ah-! It's Ellen-chan!  
**Ellen:** I screwed up! I got so excited about the off-campus learning that I was up late last night, and then I overslept!  
**Nakano Jun:** Ufufu. You're like a kid, getting all worked up over a trip.  
**Hasui Mayumi:** Whatever the reason, you shouldn't be tardy. When moving as a group, if even one person is late, it affects everyone, you know?  
**Ellen:** Uuu... I'm ashamed...  
**Himeno Shiho:** Now, now. She was only a few minutes late, so I think we can overlook it.  
**Naruse Miki:** She's right. We're here to have a good and fun time learning off-campus, after all~.  
**Kanami:** Hey, hey! What are we doing first? Was it already decided where we're going and what we're seeing?  
**Fukuda Sawano:** Nothing's been decided yet. The rule is that all the toji gathered get to go where they see fit.  
**Kanami:** Oh, okay! Then, does anyone have any ideas--  
**Mirja:**  Before we decide on a destination, there's something that needs to be done.  
**Mirja:** If we travel as such a large group, we would inconvenience other tourists. As such, we should separate into something more suitable.  
**Mirja:** With twelve of us, two groups of six should do nicely. It doesn't matter how the teams are decided--  
**Chie:** If that's how we're doing this...  
**Chie:** Tada-! We can draw straws.  
**Mihono:** You're always ready for anything, huh, Chii-nee!  
**Chie:** I am the oldest student here, after all. Anyway, mutter mutter mutter... There. Two groups of six...  
**Chie:** And, all done. Everyone, come draw a straw. They'll all have "red" or "white" marked on them.  
**Kanami:** Okay, I'll go! Mmm... It's red!  
**Hiyori:** ...I'm red too.  
**Kanami:** Yaay! We're on the same team, Hiyori-chan!  
**Hiyori:** ...Seems like it.  
**Kanami:** You don't sound excited about it, Hiyori-chan!  
**Sawano:** Which team will I be on... It's tense, isn't it? Ah, white.  
**Chie:** I'm white as well. Let's get along.  
**Mihono:** I got red... I didn't make it on the same team as Chii-nee, huh~.  
**Chie:** Fufu, don't be like that. I'm sure it'll be fun on both teams.  
**Mirja:** Now then... Everyone appears to have found their team. We should both separate and discuss where we would like to go.  
**Fujimaki Minaki:** On it! Everyone on red team with me! Let's group up over here!  
**Ellen:** Everyone on the white team! We're going to be spending the next two days together!  

## 2: Mayumi's Guidebook
**Minaki:** So anyway, everyone from red team, let's go around and introduce ourselves a little!  
**Minaki:** I'm Fujimaki Minaki, a first year high schooler from Renpu Girls' School! I love it when everyone's getting all worked up! So let's get to it today and tomorrow~!  
**Kanami:** I'm Etou Kanami, a second year middle schooler at Minoseki Academy! I like fighting matches against all kinds of people! Let's get along!  
**Mihono:** Same here, I'm a second year middle schooler from Minoseki, Asakura Mihono! I don't usually go out with everyone like this, so I'm really excited! Please look after me!  
**Hiyori:** ...Third year middle schooler from the Heijou Institute, Juujou Hiyori.  
**Mihono:** ...Ehh? That's all?  
**Hiyori:** There's nothing more to say.  
**Kanami:** Ehehe~. Hiyori-chan's a little hard to get used to, but she's a good girl on the inside. Try to get along with her!  
**Hiyori:** I-I don't need your help!  
**Jun:** I'm a second year high schooler from Ayanokouji Martial Arts School; the name's Nakano Jun. Let's have a good one.  
**Kanami:** Kyoto dialect! That's so cool!  
**Jun:** Ufufu. I'll get a big head if you keep complimenting me like that.  
**Mayumi:** I'm last! My name is Hasui Mayumi; I'm a second year in middle school at Ayanokouji Martial Arts School!  
**Mayumi:** Onee-samas, please guide me as you see fit!  
**Jun:** So lemme see, us six in the red team would be me, Etou Kanami-san, Asakura Mihono-san, Juujou Hiyori-san, Fujimaki Minaki-san, and Hasui Mayumi-san. Is that right?  
**Minaki:** Yep, that's all of us!  
**Mayumi:** This may seem sudden, but if you don't mind, I prepared a "travel guide" for today.  
**Mayumi:** If we follow the schedule I've laid out, we could see a castle, the western style residences, Chinatown, and an amusement park. How does that sound?  
**Jun:** You studied up on all that? Hey, good on you.  
**Minaki:** If you've already figured out the places to go, then that's a huge help!  
**Mihono:** Yeah! I think the red team should just follow that schedule!  
**Mayumi:** Thank you very much! Then without delay, we should get on a train to reach our first destination, the castle!  
**Mihono:** The travel guide says we should be able to see the castle as soon as we get out of this shopping district...  
**Mihono:** Oh, look, look! You can see it from here! Wow-! It's a real castle-!  
**Jun:** Sure is. The cherry blossoms are blooming beautifully too.  
**Minaki:** It's all thanks to Mayumi-san we got to see this!  
**Mayumi:** I'm glad to see you all so satisfied by it. That reminds me, about our next stop--  
**Aradama:** GRRRRUUUUUU...!  
**Hiyori:** -!! Everyone!! There's an aradama!!  
**Jun:** Ufufu. Today's not your day, is it, Mr. Aradama? To show up just when all us toji did.  
**Mihono:** Guys! The staff at the castle said, as thanks for taking care of the aradama, they'll loan us hakama for the day!  
**Jun:** My, that's awfully nice of them.  
**Mayumi:** It's about time we left for our next destination, but we can't exactly reject their kind offer, can we...  
**Minaki:** It's a good opportunity, so let's get our photos taken wearing hakama! And we'll have to get the castle and the cherry blossoms in the background too!  
**Kanami:** I like the sound of that! That aradama surprised me, but this off-campus learning is pretty fun! I can't wait to see what's next!  

## 3: A Lifelong Memory
**Chie:** Let's see~, so the ones who drew white straws would be me and... Mirja, Kohagura Ellen-san, Fukuda Sawano-san, Himeno Shiho-san, and Naruse Miki-san... That's six.  
**Chie:** So then, since we'll be spending the next two days together, why don't we all introduce ourselves?  
**Chie:** I'm Setouchi Chie, a third year in high school at Osafune Girls' Academy. Let's get along.  
**Ellen:** I'm Kohagura Ellen! A first year high schooler at Osafune Girls' Academy! I'm looking forward to this!  
**Mirja:** My name is Kitora Mirja; I'm a second year in high school at Ayanokouji Martial Arts School. Nice to meet you.  
**Sawano:** I'm Fukuda Sawano, a second year high schooler from Minoseki Academy. My hobby is reading. It's nice to meet you.  
**Ellen:** Fukuda Sawano-san... Are you the one they call Minoseki's Lord of the Library?  
**Sawano:** ...The underclassmen started calling me that, because I'm always in the library. By the way, who did you hear about that nickname from?  
**Ellen:** From Kanamin, Etou Kanami!  
**Ellen:** She said the Lord of the Library knows what's in every book, and you helped her over and over again when she's looking up swordfighting instructions!  
**Sawano:** Every book's a bit of a stretch, but I have looked through most of them.  
**Mirja:** So that's why they call you Lord...! I'd love to be able to ask you next time I have a question about a book.  
**Sawano:** I don't mind, but could I ask you to please not spread that nickname around any further...?  
**Shiho:** My name's Himeno Shiho; I'm a middle schooler from the Heijou Institute. I'm a third year, but I transferred in mid-way so I only started learning how to use a sword last year-.  
**Shiho:** As for what I like, that'd be animals! I'm looking forward to these next two days!  
**Ellen:** You're an animal lover! So do you own any pets?  
**Shiho:** Of course. I've got loads of them. My parents take in a lot of abandoned cats and dogs.  
**Ellen:** Your parents sound great! I love animals too, so I'd love to see your house sometime!  
**Shiho:** Sure thing! You're welcome any time!  
**Miki:** Seems like I'm last. I'm Naruse Miki, a second year in high school at the Heijou Institute. I plan to make a lifelong memory with you all today~.  
**Ellen:** A lifelong memory? What a beautiful phrase! I want to enjoy this as much as I can with all of you too!  
**Chie:** Is there anywhere any of you wanted to go around Yokohama, or anything you want to do?  
**Miki:** In order to make this a lifelong memory, I'm looking for a unique experience~.  
**Miki:** I've heard of a very exotic place called the Brick District, where you seem to be able to ride horse-drawn carriages...  
**Shiho:** Horses! I want to see them-!  
**Miki:** I hear they make delicious dango there as well~.  
**Ellen:** Mmmm! I can sense the perfect plan forming! We'll go ride horse-drawn carriages in the Brick District, and then eat dango!  
**Mirja:** The purpose of this trip is off-campus learning, so I believe we should study at a museum or similar institution in the area...  
**Chie:** Now, now. There's a lot of history in horse-drawn carriages too.  
**Ellen:** Exactly! And then we can study Japanese foods in detail with the dango!  
**Chie:** That one's a little harder to justify...  
**Ellen:** Chew chew... The dango in the Brick District are so good. You can really taste the Westernization.  
**Mirja:** Westernized dango...!? What does that taste like?  
**Shiho:** Ahh! Look! There's horses over there! So cute... Let's hurry up and get in a carriage!  
**Chie:** Everyone! The locals said they'll do us a favor and rent out hakama to us! Free of charge too!  
**Ellen:** Seriously!? I've always wanted to try on a hakama!! It's our lucky day!  
**Ellen:** Come on, Mirja! Let's change into hakama and eat dango in the carriage together! It'll be like one big lesson in good old Japanese culture!  
**Mirja:** I-I understand. I'm coming, so, please don't tug me so strongly.  

## 4: Are You Having Fun, Hiyori-Chan?
**Jun:** They said we could return these hakama sometime tomorrow. Really, what kind folks they were.  
**Mihono:** But we don't know if we'll run into more aradama, and they could get ruined if we fought in them. We should change back to our uniforms and only put them on when we're taking pictures.  
**Kanami:** --Hey, Hiyori-chan? Are you actually enjoying yourself? You've been looking bored this whole time.  
**Hiyori:** Just forget about me. I'm not interested in this kind of event.  
**Kanami:** Ehh-? This is a rare opportunity, so let's have fun together!  
**Minaki:** That's right! Usually, the only time we get to see girls from other schools is when missions put us together!  
**Minaki:** And we don't get to chat freely on missions, so I think we should take advantage of vacations like this!  
**Hiyori:** ...Rather than deepening friendships, it's more important that we keep improving ourselves through training.  
**Mihono:** You're such a stoic, Juujou-san...  
**Mayumi:** Though, Juujou onee-sama is top class amongst toji, so she makes a convincing argument!  
**Minaki:** I didn't even notice, but while we were talking, we made it to our next stop!  
**Kanami:** Wow...! These buildings are beautiful! What are they, again?  
**Mayumi:** These are western style trading posts that foreigners came to live in during the Meiji period.  
**Mihono:** Whoa-! So these have been here since the Meiji period! Meiji was the one that came before Showa, right?  
**Hiyori:** ...After Meiji came Taisho. Then Showa was after that.  
**Mihono:** Ah-, it was!?  
**Jun:** You might need to do a little more studying, Asakura-chan.  
**Mihono:** Ehehe~.  
**Aradama:** KIKIKIGIGIGIGI...  
**Minaki:** -!? Everybody!! Another aradama showed up!!  
**Jun:** An aradama right in downtown... We should deal with it before folks get hurt.  
**Mayumi:** Onee-samas, it's about time we headed for the next destination.  
**Jun:** It's a shame we can't see the inside while we're here. That aradama kept us busy.  
**Mihono:** Yeah, I hear you. But, at least we managed to suppress it before anything went wrong!  
**Kanami:** Oh yeah! Before we leave, don't you want to take a commemorative photo wearing hakama?  
**Minaki:** That's a good idea!  
**Kanami:** Alright! Hear that, Hiyori-chan! Start getting changed!  
**Hiyori:** I'll pass.  
**Kanami:** Ehh-! Don't be like that! I absolutely have to see what you look like in a hakama!  
**Mihono:** I kinda want to see too.  
**Jun:** I think you'd look real good in one, Juujou-chan. I want you to try it on too.  
**Minaki:** Yeah! With her pretty black hair!  
**Mayumi:** We can spare a bit of time in the schedule to see how Juujou onee-sama looks in a hakama!  
**Kanami:** Definitely! It's fine if we're a little late!  
**Kanami:** So, Hiyori-chan! Until I get to see you in a hakama, I'm not moving an inch from this spot!  
**Mihono:** And me too!　I'll be harder to move than a mountain!  
**Hiyori:** What are you doing...  
**Kanami:** I'm not moving!  
**Mihono:** I'm not moving!  
**Hiyori:** ......Fine then. If you're making me, then I'll put it on for just a little while.  
**Kanami:** We did it-!! Our plan paid off!! I can't wait to see you in a hakama, Hiyori-chan!  

## 5: Let's Go Horseriding!
**Shiho:** Ahh...! Taking a horse-drawn carriage was awesome-! Seeing the horses like that kinda makes me want to go horse riding now!  
**Ellen:** Horse riding? That sounds fun too! Have you gone horse riding before, Shiho?  
**Shiho:** Yeah! I'm a little confident in my horse riding skills! Riding in a carriage is cool too, but when you're up on the horse you get to feel the heat of its body and the muscles moving!  
**Sawano:** Horse riding...!  
**Chie:** Come to think of it, there's a ranch a little ways away from here, isn't there? Are you interested in going horse riding too, Fukuda-san?  
**Sawano:** There's a scene in a book I read about warlords in the warring states period racing across the battlefield on horseback, and ever since then I've been greatly interested in trying it.  
**Mirja:** Very well, then that ranch will be our next destination. Is that alright with you, Naruse Miki?  
**Miki:** A ranch... Horse riding sounds scary, but that could be a lifelong memory in its own way. That's fine~.  
**Ellen:** It's settled! We're headed to the ranch to get some horse riding experience!  
**Ellen:** Good! Everything's ready! The ranch lent us a horse, so we can ride it up this track one at a time!  
**Miki:** Seeing a horse up close like this, it's huge...! What an impressive animal...!  
**Shiho:** Hey, horsey. We're all going to take turns riding you, okay?  
**Ellen:** Shiho's talking to the horse! Can it understand you!? Is that some special ability!?  
**Shiho:** Ahaha, nothing like that. It's just a one sided chat--  
**Aradama:** SHAAAAAAAA!  
**Miki:** -!? There's an aradama at the other end! Look, there!  
**Shiho:** Not good! It might go after the animals on the ranch! Horsey, I need you to get me after it quick!  
**Chiho:** Ehh-!? You're going after the aradama on horseback!?  
**Shiho:** Yeah! I'll cut it off!  
**Mirja:** Wait! It's dangerous to fight an aradama alone!  
**Shiho:** Even so, I'm not letting it get near the animals!! Giddy up!!  
**Miki:** A-Amazing...! She's handling that horse like a professional...!  
**Sawano:** It's breathtaking...!  
**Sawano:** -But now's not the time to admire her! We need to run and catch up!  
**Shiho:** Thank goodness... It doesn't seem like any of the animals were hurt.  
**Mirja:** Yes, thanks to Himeno Shiho's swift arrival, it seems none of them were harmed. However, you were lucky this time.  
**Mirja:** By operating alone, you realize were exposing yourself to needless danger? Especially with so many other toji ready to fight.  
**Shiho:** I'm sorry... It's just, when it comes to animals, I start losing sight of everything else...  
**Ellen:** Well, it all turned out for the best, didn't it! It's thanks to Shiho the animals were saved, right!  
**Sawano:** On top of that, it was incredible the way you rode that horse. Like a warlord straight from the stories.  
**Miki:** I'd love to be able to ride like that as well~. Could you show us again?  
**Shiho:** --Hehe. It's embarrassing if you keep complimenting me like that.  
**Ellen:** -! I just thought of something! While we're here, why don't we try on those hakama they lent us while we ride the horse!  
**Chie:** Good idea. It's a rare opportunity, so let's get changed!  
**Chie:** (I wonder... What's Mihono-chan up to right now? I hope she's enjoying herself...)  

## 6: The Inn's Up Ahead, But...
**Kanami:** Sigh... We're almost to the inn, aren't we...?  
**Minaki:** I-I'm beat...  
**Jun:** With all the aradama popping up, it was a real struggle sticking to the guide Hasui-chan laid out.  
**Minaki:** We didn't even get to go inside the castle or the trading post...  
**Mihono:** And even though we went to Chinatown, we didn't have enough time to go in any of the stores. We had to eat convenience store bentos on the train...  
**Kanami:** For the first time in my life, I went to an amusement park and didn't get on any of the rides...  
**Hiyori:** I thought this off-campus learning would be a waste of time, but all this walking around has been a good lower body workout. We got to suppress aradama too.  
**Kanami:** At least you're thinking positive, Hiyori-chan...  
**Mayumi:** Thanks to all your hard efforts, we've managed to safely follow through with the schedule! Thank you very much!  
**Mayumi:** But, that schedule was impractical, wasn't it. Because I didn't take into account how aradama might appear, we were forced to rush through it. I'm deeply sorry.  
**Jun:** Nah, not at all. That tidy little travel guide of yours was a huge help.  
**Minaki:** We might be worn out, but we got to see lots of landmarks, and we got rid of the aradama fast, so the trip really feels complete!  
**Mihono:** Coming up with such a precise schedule must have been tough, right? You even looked up all the train times...  
**Mayumi:** I like scheduling. So I tried my best to let you all get the most out of this.  
**Jun:** That reminds me, Hasui-chan? It's only 5 in the evening, and there's still plenty of time before dinner's served, so why'd we have to hurry on back to the inn?  
**Mayumi:** Isn't that obvious! After 5 is when the city's nightlife starts, and that's not something for students to participate in!  
**Mihono:** Nightlife after 5...?  
**Kanami:** Hey, when we get to the inn, what should we do? I want to go exploring the place!  
**Mihono:** Exploring the inn! That sounds cool!  
**Hiyori:** Are you little kids...!?  
**Mayumi:** Hang on! It's in the schedule that, before we eat dinner, we'll take baths!  
**Minaki:** We're even on the schedule in the inn!?  
**Mayumi:** Of course. After eating dinner we'll play cards for 45 minutes, and then have a pillow fight until lights out at 9pm.  
**Minaki:** Even goofing off is on the schedule!  
**Mayumi:** We'll wake up the next morning at 5am, then we'll have 15 minutes to ready ourselves, followed by 30 minutes of bathtime. It's important to provide some leisure time taking care of yourself in the morning, after all.  
**Jun:** Umm. I feel like there's nothing leisurely sounding about waking up at 5 though...  
**Minaki:** But, we did agree to follow the schedule, after all! We should see it through till the end!  
**Kanami:** You're right! And if we don't stick to it, we'll never be able to wake up at 5!  
**Mayumi:** Thank you very much! The off-campus learning doesn't end until the trip's over! Let's try to stay focused until then!  
**Kanami:** Yeah-!!  
**Mihono:** ...That means, I have to get up at 5 too, doesn't it...? Can I actually do that...?  

## 7: Nightlife
**Chie:** The sun's fully set by now, hasn't it. I lost track of time with how much fun we were having riding horses at the ranch.  
**Sawano:** We don't need to check-in at the inn until 8 o'clock. That means we still have an hour of free time, so what should we do?  
**Ellen:** I'm already hungry, but I want to stay out having a good time as long as we can!  
**Miki:** I feel the same way~. Let's take a stroll down the streets in the night lighting and make some lifelong memories!  
**Miki:** I want to get some photos taken wearing the hakama we borrowed as well~.  
**Mirja:** Exploring the nightlife isn't so commendable, but we can make an exception today.  
**Mirja:** However, as soon as we've arrived at the inn and eaten, I want everyone in the bath and then bed, understood?  
**Ellen:** Ehh-!? But I wanted to have a pillow fight! And then play cards, and do a test of courage! I heard those are unbreakable traditions for Japanese students!  
**Miki:** A pillow fight, cards, and a test of courage! That sounds like a lifelong memory in the making!  
**Mirja:** How many lifelong memories do you plan on experiencing today, Naruse Miki...?  
**Miki:** I'll take every one I can come across~.  
**Shiho:** Ahh! Everybody! There's a neat looking souvenir shop over there!  
**Chie:** Come to think of it, I was wondering when I'd be able to get souvenirs for everyone back at school.  
**Ellen:** I want to get something for Kaoru and Grandpa!  
**Shiho:** We should buy some now so we aren't in a rush getting it done tomorrow.  
**Miki:** Maybe I can find a souvenir to leave a lifelong memory on someone...~  
**Sawano:** I think your expectations for souvenirs might be a little too high...  
**Chie:** Ooh... They sell folding fans and hairpins, along with sweets here.  
**Ellen:** Oh-! This present! The Japanese design is so cute! I think Grandpa would like an ornate hairpin like this!  
**Sawano:** You mean for your grandfather? Those are usually used to do up a woman's hair, so I don't think a man would want one...  
**Miki:** It would certainly be a lifelong memory, though~.  
**Miki:** --Ah! Everyone! We should all buy these Japanese umbrellas! Then we can get our photos taken! It would look wonderful together with our hakama!  
**Ellen:** ...Umbrella and hakama! That's an awesome idea! Let's pick out umbrellas for all of us--  
**Aradama:** GURURUUUUUUU...!  
**Chie:** -!? Where did that aradama's roar come from!!  
**Mirja:** From outside the shop! Everyone! Hurry!  
**Miki:** Now, since we safely defeated it, let's all get changed to take a commemorative photo here~.  
**Mirja:** Fufufu. That's certainly a lifelong memory, isn't it.  
**Ellen:** The shop gave us some umbrellas as a present! They said it's thanks for defeating the aradama! Let's get them in the photo!  
**Sawano:** A present, huh. It makes me feel a little guilty.  
**Shiho:** Then, let's make up for it by buying tons of souvenirs before we go. That way everyone's happy.  
**Chie:** These umbrellas are so beautiful... I'm glad. I'll be sure to make good use of it.  
**Ellen:** Mmhmm, it totally suits you, Chie! Like a real "Yamato Nadeshiko"!  

## 8: Off-Campus Learning, Finished!
**Kanami:** Man, what a refreshing morning!  
**Minaki:** I know! I was still pretty tired waking up at 5, but after relaxing in the bath, I'm feeling better than ever!  
**Kanami:** And we have plenty of time to pick out souvenirs!  
**Jun:** It's pretty nice actually, following a strict schedule.  
**Mayumi:** Ehehe. I'm glad to hear you're happy with it.  
**Mayumi:** If there's ever another opportunity like this, I'll come up with an even more perfect travel guide for you!  
**Mihono:** Nnng... I should've... Slept some more... I knew it... I'm sleepy...  
**Kanami:** Come on, Mihono-chan! It's the second day of our trip! It's time to start getting excited!  
**Hiyori:** ...Anyway, are the other 6 from the white team not coming?  
**Mayumi:** Mm! They're late, aren't they. We were supposed to meet at check-out time by the gift shop, and yet...  
**Mihono:** They're late? That's weird... Chii-nee and Mirja-san are on that team, after all? Those two are never late for anything...  
**Chie:** ...Oh? Is everyone from the red team picking out souvenirs?  
**Mihono:** Huh!? It's the white team! Why don't you have your luggage with you!?  
**Miki:** Why? Well, we're getting in the baths now~.  
**Mayumi:** Now!? But we were supposed to check-out at 8!?  
**Sawano:** ? Check-out is at 10 o'clock, so there's still 2 hours of free time.  
**Mihono:** --Ehhhhh-!? Seriously!?  
**Mayumi:** ...Let's see. It seems I might have been mistaken about the check-out time when I was drawing up the schedule...  
**Mirja:** Check-in last night had to be before 8pm. I assume that's where the misunderstanding came from.  
**Mayumi:** ...It's all my fault!! I'm so sorry for everything!!  
**Jun:** There's no need for you to feel responsible, Hasui-chan. Everybody makes mistakes.  
**Minaki:** Right! None of us chcked the right time either, so it's our fault too!  
**Kanami:** In fact, I'm glad we get 2 extra hours to lounge around the inn!  
**Mayumi:** O-Onee-samas...!! Thank you so much!  
**Mihono:** I know! Since we have the time, let's get in the baths again! We can join the white team!  
**Ellen:** Sounds good! We can join forces from here! It'll be more fun that way!  
**Shiho:** You know, it really feels like our off-campus learning trip is complete.  
**Miki:** I know~. We experienced so many things. There's no problem finding a lifelong memory in all that~!  
**Ellen:** How did things go for everyone on the red team?  
**Kanami:** We found a lifelong memory too, of course! I got to see Hiyori-chan in a hakama!  
**Mihono:** Yeah! She looked so natural wearing it! The photos turned out great too~!  
**Hiyori:** Hey, when did you...!  
**Chie:** Ufufu, it sounds like you had a good time.  
**Ellen:**  That's great! I want to go around with the rest of you next time; I wish we could do this every month!
