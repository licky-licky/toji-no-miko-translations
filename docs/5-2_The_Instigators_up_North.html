Akira-san said they knew the reason why it's going rampant...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> What should I... do now? She said, "before it's too late," but...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ......<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> .........<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I can't tell anything thinking here like this~! I'll just have to ask them directly!!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Absolutely not.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ehh~!!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Mmm, I think... I'm against it too.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> I'm worried, after you lost control again. And, this... Inago-san? We can't even be sure if she's telling the truth...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> But, Kaoru-san said that Akira-san was from Mokusa too!<br><strong>Chie:</strong>　Even if she is... What we call Mokusa has lots of smaller factions to it...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> It does?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> ...Yes. I don't know them all very well myself, but, aside from the main faction which aims to enshrine and suppress aradama, there are meant to be people with lots of different ideologies.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> With all our research into Kashuu Kiyomitsu, we've found nothing but dead ends. They may say they know, but frankly I find that dubious at best.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Inago Akira... was it?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah, Akira-san was the one who said they knew, but she said the one who really knows is her childhood friend. I think her name was... Hitakami Makoto-san?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Hitakami... Makoto?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Do you know her?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Y-Yes. She's a toji from Osafune.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Hitakami Makoto is a third year in Osafune Girls' Academy's high school division. It was only for a little while, but... we were in the same unit once too.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Come to think of it, I never really heard much about what you were doing back then. Did you get along with her?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Well, I don't think we got along too badly. I was curious how she was doing... She's working hard it seems.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> You seem kind of happy about it?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Fufu, that's true.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> I wasn't expecting her name to come up here, so you caught me by surprise.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> If it's Makoto, I think it might be alright, but...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> What's Hitakami-san like, Chii-nee?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> A yamato nadeshiko. If I wanted to describe Makoto, there's no phrase that fits her better.     [Just look up yamato nadeshiko to see a list of adjectives, but it's essentially the epitome of traits that make up an ideal Japanese woman.]<br><strong>Chie:</strong> She's gentle, and ladylike, and intelligent... Though, she could be stubborn too.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> On top of that, she had real skill as a toji.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> This toji, Hitakami Makoto, she didn't participate in the tournament, did she?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Osafune has Kaoru-san and Ellen-san there. It would be a little difficult fighting those two to be selected for the tournament.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I see...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> (However, Inago Akira and Hitakami Makoto... For them to be so powerful, their names are relatively unknown...)<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> (...No, I must be reading too deeply into it.)<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Was there something that caught your attention?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ...There wasn't.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> We should go speak with them in the near future. However, please wait just a little longer first.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> A little longer?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Yes. In that time, I would like to find more on Inago Akira, Hitakami Makoto, and, the other one...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yuuki. Toribane Yuuki.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Toribane Yuuki, was it. I'm going to gather information on these three.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Information...?  I don't think you have to go that far, do you...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> You need to understand the gravity of the situation.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> For Kashuu Kiyomitsu... For an okatana's power to go rampant is nothing to take lightly.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Things are the way they are because the investigation team is working directly under the Origami Family... But we have no way of knowing when that may change.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> We need to act with caution right now.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Is the situation really that bad?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Without a doubt. You should assume that your situation is more unstable than you realize.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Alright.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> In addition, no matter what comes up, please refrain from using Kashuu Kiyomitsu's power. Do you understand?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ......I understand.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> (If I force the issue this much, she should avoid going rampant again for the time being.)<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> (If Asakura Mihono were to repeatedly lose control, her position will certainly worsen.)<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> (Though... There is now even more work to be done. I'll need to immediately find information on Hitakami Makoto, Inago Akira, and Toribane Yuuki...)<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Aradama!?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> ...It's fine for you to wait on standby today, Mihono-chan.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> No, I can fight even without using that power, and I'll feel better getting some exercise than sitting around worrying!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Very well then.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ...The investigation team will sortie as soon as we've assembled!  </p><h2 id="2-results-of-investigating-the-hitakami-faction" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>2: Results of Investigating the Hitakami Faction</h2><p>At that time--</p><p><strong>Yukari:</strong> How is the investigation into Mokusa's extremist factions going?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> We've finished compiling data on all the related individuals. Yomi.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes, here it is.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Hmm... Oh, huh?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> What is it?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I feel like, there's someone in here I've seen before.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Well now. For you to remember someone, even slightly, they must be somewhat capable.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yume, that's a toji that you once cut down.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ah... They're in here too, huh.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> That was all under Tagitsuhime's influence. Does it still bother you?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> ...It's the truth though, that I'm the one who attacked Mokusa.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Then, you'll need to prove it with your actions going forward. How the new Tsubakuro has changed from the old one.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> The old me, and the new me... I got it, Yukari-sama!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Good.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Satsuki, which of these faction requires our attention?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> There are several, but... The most important one is the Hitakami faction.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> The faction headed by the Hitakami Family, the distinguished toji family from Tohoku...<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes. Their position is to reduce harm suffered by toji while suppressing aradama. They have stated they are willing to find positive applications for aradama to make that happen.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Positive applications for aradama... Do you know what exactly they mean?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I wasn't able to find that much. However, they appear to be carrying out some experiments utilizing aradama.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> It seems they've acquired materials on the Myouga toji project as well, so we can assume they are making real advances.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Myouga toji...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Did they not join in back then because they determined Tagitsuhime wouldn't reduce toji casualties?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> They may espouse radical ideals, but they shouldn't have shown any serious movements before now.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Recently, the previous head of the family passed away. Her daughter has now inherited her position.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> The current head of the Hitakami family is... Hitakami Makoto. And, the toji closest to Hitakami Makoto would be...<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Both Inago Akira and Toribane Yuuki.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Inago Akira...?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Yomi. Hasn't this toji come to see you before?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ...She has.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Hitakami Makoto, Inago Akira, Toribane Yuuki... I come from the same town as the three of them.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Which means... They're from Akita?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes. I went to the same elementary school as the three of them... And, in particular, Inago Akira's home was in my neighborhood.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Special Raid Unit, Mashiko Kaoru, coming in-.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Itomi Sayaka, entering.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Is Origami Yukari here? I brought the report from our last mission.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Did something happen?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Asakura Mihono got overwhelmed by the power of Kashuu Kiyomitsu and went on a rampage. What's the deal with that okatana?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Mashiko Kaoru, watch your tone when talking to Yukari-sama...<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> It's fine, Shidou.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> ...Yes ma'am.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> What happened with Asakura Mihono?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Me and Sayaka managed to stop her. But, it was pretty close.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Even with you and Sayaka-chan, she came pretty close to beating you!?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm. Mihono was strong.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> She went on a rampage, hm... Yukari-sama! I want to try fighting that onee-san when she's rampaging!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> You can't.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> ...You two did well. Was there anything else that happened?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> A toji who was there said something that got my attention. That, she knew what was happening to Mihono.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> That is a rather concerning statement. ...What was this toji's name? We'll make preparations to summon her here straight away.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Inago Akira.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...! The toji from the Hitakami faction...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> There's a bad pattern forming here...<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> ...Thank you for your efforts.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Then, I made my report and all. We're leaving, Sayaka.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Okay.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yukari-sama, should we question her?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> ...Let her go for now.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Understood.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> All of you, please continue the investigation.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Yes ma'am!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ............<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ...Akira.  </p><h2 id="3-no-matter-how-many-times-i-repeat-it" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>3: No Matter How Many Times I Repeat It</h2><p><strong>Yomi:</strong> Shidou-san, do you have a moment?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> What do you need, Yomi?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> During our lunch break, I'm going to step out for a while. I should be back in an hour.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> It's up to you how you spend your breaks... But, you don't often ask things like that.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Now is a good time for me to visit.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Do you mind if I ask where you're going?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ...The hospital.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Excuse me.<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> ...Come in.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ...How is your health?<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> Fine.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I brought flowers and fruits.<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> Oh.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ......<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I'll replace the water for the flowers.　<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> ...<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ...<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> ...<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ...I need to leave soon.<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> Right.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ......<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I'm not sure if you're aware, but I was assigned to the Special Defense Team.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I plan to make use of this power there.<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> ...Don't you regret it?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I don't.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> If the same thing were to happen... I would join you again.<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> ...Oh.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I'm sorry to have bothered you.<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> ...<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I'll come again.<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> ...<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> ...Okay.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I've returned.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> How's she doing?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Her body is recovering properly. But... she seems depressed.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> I see.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I'm returning to my assignment.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> ...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Do you really not want to remove your aradama?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I don't.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> This is the power that she gave to me. With this power... I'll perform my duties.  </p><h2 id="4-training-1" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>4: Training!

But, you get exactly half, alright!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Sure!  </p><h2 id="5-training-2" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>5: Training!

The last one's going your way!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Okay!<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> AAAAAAAA!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> This is the last one... Urghh.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Mihocchi?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> U-Urgh...<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> GYAAAAAAAAAA!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> You got a stomachache!?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Alright, then just sit tight!!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Fukki, don't move!!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> !?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...You can't, come over here...! AAAAAAGGGHHHHHHHHHH!!<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> -!!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Wha!? Mihocchi just swung her okatana, and...!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> That was quite the empowered strike... It looked to be a high level of hachimanriki.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Who gives a shit about levels and whatever right now!? Oi, Mihocchi! What do you want me to do!?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> It's okay... It's okay... Letting some power out, I think it's calming down...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> [pant, pant...]<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...Did she get it under control?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> ...It looks like she did.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Mihocchi, can I come over to you now?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Yeah, it's fine. I'm sorry, for making you worry.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Have some milk.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Thanks a lot. [gulp gulp...] Phew.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Did it calm you down? It's from Shichinosato-san's special stock, so I can vouch for the taste.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Who said you could go take from that! ...Well, it's fine this time, I guess.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ahaha. This is pretty tasty.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Right? It's been my new favorite.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...So, that's that rampage thing, huh? You scared me, when that came out of nowhere.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> That was one step away from it... I think? Last time I lost consciousness, but I managed to stay awake through it this time...<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I did collect data during it, just in case, but... There was too little data to make anything out...<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> The situation was more tense than I expected. Is there any way you could safely reproduce that?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I don't... think I could. I don't want it to go rampant that many times anyway...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I don't know anything about why it's going rampant... or how I can get Kashuu Kiyomitsu under control in the first place.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...Can you actually even control that? It... looked pretty bad to me.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> To be honest... I'm not really sure.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I'm not sure how possible this is, but... One option is to try exchanging for a different okatana.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> But... I don't want to do that.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Kashuu Kiyomitsu is the okatana I inherited from my mother. I don't want to be scared of it.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Well... I'm not sure I can do much, but, if there's anything I can do to help, tell me, alright?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Thanks, Fukki. But, you don't have to worry about me that much.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (...I wasn't even trying to use Kiyomitsu's power there. Does that mean I'm running out of time?)<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (Hitakami Makoto-san... Maybe I will go talk to her.)<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Your phone's ringing, Mihocchi.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Uhh... Oh, my next assignment came in. I have to suppress aradama that appeared in the Tohoku region.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Joining in are... Akira-san, and Yuuki.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Is something wrong?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah, no, I'm just going with people I know.  </p><h2 id="6-to-tohoku-1" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>6: To Tohoku (1)</h2><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> They're supposed to be here... Oh, there they are! Heyyy! Akira-san! Yuuki!<br><strong>Akita:</strong> Oh, you made it, Mihono.<br><strong>Yuuki:</strong> It's been a while, Mihono-san. Has it gone rampant since then...?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Thanks for worrying about me, Yuuki. Yeah, it did a little...<br><strong>Yuuki:</strong> Is that so...<br><strong>Akira:</strong> ...We're all here, so why don't we get going.<br><strong>Yuuki:</strong> It's been such a long time since I rode on a train together with Akira-nee-sama. Ever since you got your license, you've always been on your bike.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Nn? Ahh, now that you mention it, you're right.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Well, nothing wrong with taking the train from time to time. Yuuki, Mihono, you want an orange?<br><strong>Yuuki:</strong> I'll have one.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah, okay... It's cold!?<br><strong>Yuuki:</strong> They're refridgerated oranges. ...Mm, it's cold and sweet.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Haha, that's for sure.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Can I ask you something, Akira-san?<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Hmm-? What's up?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> What you said to me, before... What is it that's happening to me?<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Ahh, it's about that. ...Want another orange?<br><strong>Yuuki:</strong> Ah, I'll take it. Thank you very much, Nee-sama.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Akira-san!<br><strong>Akira:</strong> O-Oi, don't go shouting. The passengers're all looking.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> You weren't lying to me, were you?<br><strong>Yuuki:</strong> Nee-sama doesn't tell lies, Mihono-san.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> That's what I believe too, but still!<br><strong>Akira:</strong> You're panicking, aren't you.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I let out a crazy strong hachimanriki... I managed to stop it before I did more than that, but...<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Next time, you might not be so lucky, right.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Right.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Sorry bout this. I wanna talk about it, but it's just something someone told me too, and it's a real long story at that.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> But, we should be able to explain the stuff you wanna know, so don't panic over it. We're getting things ready for you.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Getting things ready?<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Yeah. So, for now, just kick back and have some cooled oranges.<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> GURURU...<br><strong>Yuuki:</strong> The readings on the spectrum finder have vanished. That aradama looks to be the last of them.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> That's our job done. ...Mihono.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Y-Yes?<br><strong>Akira:</strong> You know we're with Mokusa, don't you?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yes, I know.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Our faction's base is right around here.

Let's go, Mihono-san.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Wait! If that's an aradama, I'll fight it with you!<br><strong>Akira:</strong> That's not it. This's just one of our screwups. You've gotta clean up your own mistakes.<br><strong>Yuuki:</strong> Mihono-san, we're going!!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> H-Hey, Yuuki! Don't pull me!<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Sigh...<br><strong>???:</strong> GURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!<br><strong>Akira:</strong> They totally fucked this up.

About Mokusa's Hitakami faction?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...I pretty much don't know anything. Is it... bad that I don't know anything...?<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> No, that won't be a problem at all. I'll begin my explanation from there.<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> As the name suggests, the Hitakami faction is led by the Hitakami family-- A faction based here, in the Tohoku region, out of our old home.<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> And our ideology is to make effective use of aradama, for the benefit of toji and society.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> To use aradama... Do you mean like Myouga toji...?<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> The case involving Myouga toji and Tagitsuhime was an unfortunate incident that brought about many victims...<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> Nevertheless, humans are ever-evolving creatures. Spurred on by that incident, we have been able to make progress.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Progress...?<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> Now then, this introduction has gone on rather long, hasn't it.<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> There is something I am able to tell you, in regards to your power.<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> Firstly, let us speak of your family line... Let's speak of the Asakura family.<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> There is a deep connection between the Hitakami and the Asakura. The full nature of which has been passed down through this family.<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> Yet... Before I may explain it to you, there is something I must inquire.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> What's that?<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> Your resolve.<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> After our conversation has finished, you will know the truth of Kashuu Kiyomitsu.<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> However... Once you know that, you will be unable to return to your former life.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> -!?<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> To have the truth made clear... Do you have the resolve to step over to our side?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ......<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> You say resolve, but, I'm not sure. All I know is... I don't want to be afraid of Kiyomitsu.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> This okatana... It's something I got from my mother; something important to remember her by.<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> You do have a good look in your eyes. Very well.<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> Then, there is one last thing I will check for myself. Whether you truly have the disposition for it. Whether... you are a descendant of Atago.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Atago...?<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> Please come with me.<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> This place should do well.<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> I am now going to wield my okatana with the intent of killing you. Please fight back earnestly.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Eh? Killing me... What...!?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...!?<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> If you do not fight, you will die.  </p><h2 id="9-hitakami-makoto-2" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>9: Hitakami Makoto (2)</h2><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> HAA-!!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Gh!!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (She's strong!

<strong>Mihono:</strong> If you're this strong, why weren't you in the tournament? You, and Akira-san too... You would have definitely placed high!<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> Our power isn't for fighting in tournaments. It's for protecting the people.

There's no results.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Really...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I want to hurry and find some information that will give Hono-chan peace of mind...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ...Yes. Though, I can't understand it.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Eh?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> There isn't a single account of any okatana, not just Kashuu Kiyomitsu, running rampant.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> There isn't, is there...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> But, it seems like, if someone lost control of an okatana's power, there would definitely be records of it...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Did someone conceal them, or, was this the first case of an okatana's power going rampant...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> (But, if that were the case, it contradicts Inago Akira...
