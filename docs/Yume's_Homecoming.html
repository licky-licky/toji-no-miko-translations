Only eliminate the aradama that cross the barricade line!<br><strong>Toji Platoon Captain:</strong> As soon as HQ sends us backup, we'll join forces and move in! Until they get here, don't let a single one of them through!<br><strong>Toji Vice-Captain:</strong> Backup has arrived! But, um...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Onee-sans, you can just sit back and watch~. I'll take care of allll of it from here by myself.<br><strong>Toji Platoon Captain:</strong> The Special Defense Team...? But, on your own... Ah--!<br><strong>Toji Platoon Captain:</strong> W-Wait...! There's too many of them for her to go in on her own...!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Please follow her orders.<br><strong>Toji Platoon Captain:</strong> No, but, that's multiple aradama nests combined in there!? We'll get our own entry team ready straight away--<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> There's no need. I'll support her from the back.<br><strong>Toji Platoon Captain:</strong> That's clearly not going to be enough! Are you just sending her in there to get killed!?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Once, a similar situation happened in the past. It was right after the elite guard had been formed.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Seeing her break into a swarm of aradama by herself, one team chose on their own to follow and support her.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Ultimately, they couldn't match her pace and suffered many casualties.<br><strong>Toji Platoon Captain:</strong> ......<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Please follow her orders for now.<br><strong>Toji Platoon Captain:</strong> ...Understood.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> There, I'm done. Yomi-onee-san, did you keep track of the time?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes. It took 10 minutes and 20 seconds to exterminate them.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Nnn~. If I hadn't messed around halfway, I probably could've gotten under 10 minutes. One of them even got away when I wasn't looking.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> There's no need to worry about that. I disposed of it.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Oh, thanks~.<br><strong>Toji Platoon Captain:</strong> ......<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Anyway, you can take care of the rest, onee-sans~.<br><strong>Toji Platoon Captain:</strong> R-Right.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ah-- Hey, hey. I've got a question for you.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Do you know who I am?<br><strong>Toji Platoon Captain:</strong> O-Of course. You're Tsubakuro Yume, of the Special Defense Team, aren't you?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Nihihi~. Yep, it's good you remembered! Seeya.<br><strong>Toji Vice-Captain:</strong> There's nothing on the spectrum finder. All signs of aradama are silent.<br><strong>Toji Platoon Captain:</strong> The puddles of noro... it's like you can trace them all in a line...<br><strong>Toji Vice-Captain:</strong> It's amazing. Practically none of it got splashed around. It might be weird to call it neat and tidy, but...<br><strong>Toji Platoon Captain:</strong> She must have wasted as few motions as possible finishing them off. There's no way we could replicate that.<br><strong>Toji Vice-Captain:</strong> The Special Defense Team... Wasn't the old elite guard supposed to be a bunch of experts at anti-personnel fighting the old director brought together, in case of emergency?<br><strong>Toji Platoon Captain:</strong> Normally, anti-aradama missions make up 99% of toji work. The record holder on exterminating aradama is the Special Defense Team's captain, Heijou's Shidou Maki.<br><strong>Toji Vice-Captain:</strong> And still, when they're just clearing out aradama on the side, they can show off like this... Almost makes you wonder why we're even here, doesn't it.<br><strong>Toji Vice-Captain:</strong> It sounds like the noro recovery team just showed up.<br><strong>Toji Platoon Captain:</strong> Have Irie's unit cover them, just to be safe.<br><strong>Toji Vice-Captain:</strong> Understood.<br><strong>Toji Platoon Captain:</strong> If anything... We should just be glad we can leave that much sooner and that no one was hurt.<br><strong>Toji Vice-Captain:</strong> Right.  </p><h2 id="2-its-an-order-from-the-director" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>2: It's an Order From the Director.</h2><p><strong>Maki:</strong> Good work on your mission, you two. The people back at the site just gave us their thanks.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Especially for you, Yume. They had a lot of respect for how you took charge of the situation.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> See? That proves it, right? That you can send me on even more missions now.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> If you want, I could take care of every~ last aradama out there all by myself, okay?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> That wouldn't be reasonable. Just within the main office's jurisdiction, there were several outbreaks of aradama today.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I know that. I was just joking. Are you trying to make fun of me, Yomi-onee-san?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> With how you've been recently, I thought you might have been serious.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> We're just glad to see you're doing better. But, we can't give you permission to dispatch that often.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> ...Why not? ...Is it because of my body?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> No. Though, I'm not saying we aren't worried about that...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> This time was an exception. It's rare to see an aradama nest get to that scale.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> And that platoon was mostly made up of newer toji. If they'd pushed in, they probably wouldn't have been able to avoid a few casualties.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> But that's why I went in. And nobody got hurt, so what's the problem?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> We should normally leave it to the girls in the field. Even if you do good work, is that going to let the new toji grow? The best way for them to train is by experience.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yume. You should listen to the advice of your predecessor here.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Especially considering she used to be so concerned for her subordinate's well-being that she'd repeatedly rush into battles alone.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> S-Suzuka, did you have to bring that up? That's part of why I'm telling her this.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Wait, really? Maki-onee-san, you don't really get to talk, do you?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yume, someday, you'll need to reach the point that you can stop fighting alone and start leading a team of your own.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh~? I'll pass on that. You or Maki-onee-san can do it for me.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> That's not how this goes... You're still the same as ever, Yume.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> By the way, I have news for all of you. We've been given an order from the bureau director.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> An order from the director...?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> She said that, before the end of the month, we're each to each take our vacations that we've been putting off.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> But, wait. With the way things are now...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> It's an order from the director. You know what that means.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Akane-sama sure has a different kind of intensity than Yukari-sama...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> And, I was able to decide on how to allot our vacation time.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> First will be Maki-san, followed by Yume and myself, and Yomi-san, you'll need to wait slightly longer than the rest of us.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I don't mind.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> We were also given permission to return to our families during this time. Rather, you could think of that as the main purpose of this vacation.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> To go back home...?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> However, and you should be familiar with this by now, as Myouga test subjects, the bureau has us under surveillance.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> While you're away from work and visiting home, you'll be accompanied by a supervisor.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Uwah. Somebody's gonna be watching us the whole time we're on vacation? What a pain.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> There's no way around it. It's part of what we were prepared for when we accepted this. That's just the nature of what's inside our bodies.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> But, Maki-onee-san, when I was gone, didn't you spend the whole time running around by yourself?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Th-That's different...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Of course, they were severely reprimanded for that. Maki-san and Yomi-san both.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ......<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Though, because of all the people who covered for us, we were able to come back.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> I'm just glad the four of us could be here together again.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Yeah, yeah. How many times do you have to say that-?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I'm worn out from today. If we're done talking about the important stuff, can I go back to my room?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Of course.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> You did great today, Yume. Go get some rest.  </p><h2 id="3-im-saying-its-annoying" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>3: I'm Saying It's Annoying!</h2><p><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yume.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Whaat?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> You're the only one I haven't received a home leave request from yet.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Cause I didn't turn one in.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Could you do it soon? We have to consider the schedules of those traveling with us.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I'm not going home though? So there's no point in me writing one.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...You aren't going home?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Yeah.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Maki-onee-san, you get to leave this afternoon, right? You're going back home?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> It's in Tokyo, so it won't take long. I'll just go say hi to my parents and see how my little brother and sister are doing.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Huh. You have a brother and a sister, Maki-onee-san? Do you get along with them?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> I'm not sure. I don't think we have issues; we're normal, I guess.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I don't know what normal's like for that though.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Oh yeah, you're an only child, aren't you. Did you ever wish you had a brother or sister?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Not really. If I had any, they'd probably be annoying to deal with.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> ...Yume. Why is it you don't want to go back home?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Cause it's annoying. I don't really have a reason to go back either.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> You don't need a reason to go back and see your family, do you? You'll get to see your parents.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I haven't seen Mama in a long time, but I already saw Papa a little while ago.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> That was when you came back, wasn't it.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Somebody important from the bureau went to apologize to my family one day, saying there'd been a mixup and they'd given them the wrong information. That their dead daughter was actually still alive.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> But doesn't it sound way too convenient that they just took me to the hospital and also my sickness got all better?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> ...After that, you got to meet directly with your father, didn't you?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Yeah. They called Papa to the hospital. But, I talked to him on the phone before that.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> All the details were classified, so I couldn't really talk about anything though.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> What did your father have to say?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> "Is that really you, Yume?" "Are you feeling fine now?" That's all he'd ask about.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> I think your parents were confused at the time.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> They must have been devastated about you back then. So it was probably hard for them to get their feelings together. I know it was like that for us...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> ......<br><strong>Maki:</strong> But still, you came back to us. There's no denying that.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> So right now, when things are calmed down, I think you should really go see them once and talk it all over.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Aghhh~, seriously... That's what I mean...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> That's why, I'm saying it's annoying!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Ah...! Yume...  </p><h2 id="4-could-you-try-to-talk-to-her" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>4: Could You Try to Talk to Her?</h2><p><strong>Maki:</strong> I'm counting on you while I'm gone. If anything urgent comes up, call me on the emergency line.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Alright.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> And... about Yume.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Yomi. If you could, do you think you could try talking to her?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Akane-sama was nice enough to give us this vacation. I think what she wanted most from it was for Yume to meet with her parents.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I think so too.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Though, knowing Tsubakuro-san, it won't be easy to persuade her.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> That's for sure. If she's that against it...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> By the way, have you seen Suzuka...?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> You called?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Suzuka? Why do you have luggage with you...?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Because I'll be going on a mission now. Accompanying you, as a supervisor on behalf of the Sword Administration Bureau.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> ...You're going with me? You're my supervisor?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yes. Is there something wrong with that?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> No... It's just, up till now, my supervisor was always one of the suits from the bureau.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> The bureau seems to have its hands full. It just so happens to be that I was given this job.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> In that case... I'm actually glad you're the one coming with me.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I-It's just business and nothing more.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> I get that.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Anyway, Yomi. We're leaving the rest to you.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Okay. Shidou-san, Konohana-san, have a nice vacation.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Th-This is still business for me.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh? But, doesn't that make no sense? Wouldn't they need an actual supervisor?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I'm not sure. It's not so strictly regulated. I suppose it does imply someone external though.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Then, aren't there a bunch of things we could do? Like, the four of us could go on a trip together!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> We could. Tsbuakuro-san. Should I make some tea?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I'll have some-. Also, some snacks would be great.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> ...Ith hot~. I can't handle hot tea.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I've heard that most people who think they can't drink hot tea tend to touch it first with the tip of their tongue.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Really? Actually, maybe I do do that.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Though, if you don't want to drink it hot, you should let it cool for a little and then take it slowly.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> ...Yeah.

I'm getting kinda bored. Why can't more aradama show up?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> You defeated so many of them the other day. When things are boring for us, that's good for normal people.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I guess you've got a point...<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Tsubakuro-san. I heard you won't be going home.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Yeah? What about you, Yomi-onee-san? Are you going home?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I will be.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> My family lives far away, so it's hard for me to go back without lots of time off like this.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Your family lives way out in the middle of nowhere, right, Yomi-onee-san?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ......I think you have the wrong idea. They live in a normal neighborhood.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh? But I thought for sure your family had one of those big fireplaces in the middle of the floor, like you see in old stories.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> We don't have that.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Hmmm? Yomi-onee-san, is it me, or are you a little upset?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I'm not.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ahahah. You know, we never really talk about stuff like this, do we.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Hey, hey. What's your family like, Yomi-onee-san?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> It's just a normal family out in the countryside. There's my parents and my two older brothers.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Your brothers?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes. Both of them have already left home, so only my parents and our dogs are there.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> You have dogs?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> We do. My mom loves dogs.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Huh. What're they like?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Right now, we have two small indoor dogs. A yorkshire terrier and a miniature dachshund.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> My mom sends me videos of them. Would you like to see?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Yeah!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> This one is the yorkshire terrier. This one is the miniature dachsund. Both of them are girls.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Woww...! The dachshund's just a puppy.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> We only got her half a year ago.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Fufu. She looks kinda like a little stuffed animal.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> You keep them in your house?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> With these ones we do. It was different before.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> We used to have a large white akita inu we kept in the yard. I would walk her every day.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Huh.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> But, when I was in 6th grade, she died. She was very old, so it came naturally.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Oh...<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> That might have been the most I've ever cried. Even now, I still often dream about her.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> .........<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> After that, we went a while without having a dog. But then a friend of my oldest brother's gave us a puppy.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> That's the yorkshire terrier here.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> So that's her.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> My mom has lots of free time, so she takes videos of the dogs and sends them to me. She sends me videos she finds online too.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> So that's what you're always watching. I was wondering.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Huh. So you must get along with your mom.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> My mom talks with me most of the time, but my dad and brothers usually send me messages too. They're only brief messages though.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> What do they talk about?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Lots of things. About the dogs. About relatives. About what they've eaten. About if the flowers are blooming. About whether it's hot or cold out.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> It's mostly all insignificant. We usually don't have much to say to each other.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Doesn't that get annoying to put up with? Do you have to do it?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> It's not annoying to put up with. I only do it when I have spare time after all.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> If I had to say whether or not I had to do it, maybe I don't.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> But, that's still fine. That's just how my family is.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Hmmm.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I did ask you a lot of stuff, but y'know, you're talking a lot more than usual today, Yomi-onee-san.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Am I?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Yeah. You don't really talk this much normally. And you never talked about your family before.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> That's only because I never thought it was necessary to bring it up.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Why're you talking about it now then?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I think it's necessary.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I thought it would be easier for you to talk to me if I did first.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Talk about what?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> About your family.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> ......<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Could you tell me about them, Tsubakuro-san? What your family is like.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> And, why it is that you don't want to go home.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> ......<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Sigh...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I guess I'm no good with you, Yomi-onee-san.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I don't really get why, but I kind of want to tell you about it.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Please tell me.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Okay... Then...  </p><h2 id="6-i-dont-want-to-know" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>6: I Don't Want to Know.</h2><p><strong>Yume:</strong> My mama and papa really love me.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Cause they were really proud I was their daughter. As far back as I can remember, they were always praising me.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Whatever I wanted, they'd buy it for me, and whatever I asked, they'd do it for me.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> When I said I wanted to take the okatana test, they let me, and when I said I wanted to learn to swordfight, they started taking me to the dojo.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> And then, when we found out I was a prodigy, all the adults around made a real big deal out of it. Papa and Mama were really happy too.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> But, after I got into Ayanokouji's elementary school, we found out I was sick.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> That's when the boring time I spent in the hospital started.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ......<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I was surprised at how sad Papa and Mama looked. I mean, normally you wouldn't want to let me know, so you'd pretend like nothing's wrong, right?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> But they didn't. Especially Mama; she was crying the whole time... Even though I was a kid, I could tell. That I probably didn't have a lot of time left.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ......<br><strong>Yume:</strong> At first, Papa and Mama would both come see me almost every day.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> But then they only came once a week, and then every other week...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I found out why. Mama was getting so depressed that, even though I was the one who was sick, I was more worried about her.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> My mama, she came from a really wealthy family, and she's really pretty, but she's really weak too. And she couldn't lie at all.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> It's cause Mama loved me so much. I knew that for sure; I really did.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> And, when I heard from Papa she collapsed from anxiety, I felt like, she just couldn't help it.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> After that, Mama stopped coming to see me. I think it was hard for her to look at me, with how I kept getting skinnier.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> She did try to go to the hospital a couple times, but she'd always get worse and have to leave. At some point the doctors even stopped her.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> After that I'd only see my papa. But Mama got even more depressed because she was the only who wouldn't see me.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Papa would come see me without letting Mama know, but Mama could tell, and we couldn't keep hiding it from her.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> After that, I didn't get to see Papa or Mama again. Just talk to them on the phone sometimes.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Papa would just say he's sorry, over and over. I really hated it... Cause I was the one making it so hard for them.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> All I ever heard from Mama anymore was her crying. She used to smile at me all the time, telling me how good I was.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I wanted to see Papa and Mama again, but I didn't want them crying and saying sorry anymore. So I decided I didn't need it.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Or I tried to make myself think that way at least, but I was still just a kid then...<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ......<br><strong>Yume:</strong> After that, Yukari-sama and President Souraku came, and after some stuff happened I got to leave the hospital.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> After you left, what did your parents say?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I only talked to Papa a little on the phone. It wasn't like I had been cured or anything; I just got a little extra time.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> After they let me out of the hospital, and before I came to the elite guard, President Souraku trained me really closely about swordfighting at Ayanokouji.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> She'd tell me I was already stronger than she was. Cause I was a prodigy and all~.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> And then, you know what happened after that.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I do.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> ......<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Hey, Yomi-onee-san? Can I ask you something?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Okay.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> That night, the night that I died.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Yomi-onee-san... Did you cry for me?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ......<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I did cry.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> You did?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> But, you said the most you cried was when your dog died, wasn't it?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> That's right. But, I was still just a kid then.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Heyyy, don't copy me.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Fufu.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ah, you laughed. That almost never happens.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I laugh sometimes. If I find something funny.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> ......<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Hey, Yomi-onee-san?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Do you think I'm a coward?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Why would I think that? You're brave, Tsubakuro-san. Very brave.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Yeah, I guess so.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> But, and it's just a little bit, but I'm scared...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> When I died, when Papa and Mama found out about it, what was it like...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> And I... I don't want to know...<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ......<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Even still, my opinion of you won't change.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> You're brave, Tsubakuro-san. You're someone who can challenge herself and fight for what you want.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I'm sure you'll find it this time too. Whatever it is that you want.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> ......  </p><h2 id="7-this-doesnt-feel-anything-like-a-vacation" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>7: This Doesn't Feel Anything Like a Vacation.</h2><p><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yume.

I guess that's normal for you, Suzuka.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yume's home is along the way, so I thought it worked out perfectly.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> This helps.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> But wait, why're all four of us going?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> This time, I'm Suzuka's supervisor and Yomi's your supervisor.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> It sorta doesn't feel anything like a vacation; it's like another mission.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Haha. Well, the two of us are on duty. But I'm still kind of excited.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Mmm... Well, whatever.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Tsubakuro-san. It seems like it's going to happen surprisingly quickly.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> ......<br><strong>Maki:</strong> What do you mean?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> It's nothing.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Anyway, I'm just glad she decided to go. Thanks for doing that for me, Yomi.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I didn't do anything. Tsubakuro-san decided this for herself.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> She won't admit it, but Yomi-san must have been the one behind her change of heart.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> I used to think they were total opposites. But Yomi might actually be the one who understands Yume best.  </p><h2 id="8-stop-saying-that-youre-sorry" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>8: Stop Saying That You're Sorry!</h2><p><strong>Yume:</strong> It's been a long time since I came back here.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Though, I was only here for elementary school, and I wasn't even there for a year.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> It's probably been a while for you too, huh Suzuka.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Not at all.
