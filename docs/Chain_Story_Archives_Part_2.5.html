You understand what the state of things is like now, don't you?<br><strong>Ema:</strong> The entire country, not only Kanto, has seen a rise in the frequency of aradama appearances. And not a day goes by without debate over Kamakura's special hazardous waste leakage issue being broadcast on television.<br><strong>Ema:</strong> They're going to be airing Akane-sama's hearing very soon too.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...I know. Nothing's like it used to be.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> There weren't this many aradama before, and the STT didn't spend this much time busy with missions.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Everyone from the investigation team never even gets to see each other anymore...<br><strong>Ema:</strong> About the investigation team, its activities are going to be suspended.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> There's not going to be an investigation team anymore!?<br><strong>Ema:</strong> It shouldn't go away just yet.<br><strong>Ema:</strong> But, at least until the special hazardous waste problem is settled, you all won't be taking any action as part of the investigation team.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Then, when you said we'd talk about what I'll be doing from now on, do you mean you're putting me in some other unit?<br><strong>Ema:</strong> Asakura-san. There are two options available for you now.<br><strong>Ema:</strong> The first is to be part of a unit under the Five Traditions, working with the Special Task Team.<br><strong>Ema:</strong> The other is to become a provisional member of a unit under command of the Metropolitan Police Department. It will be difficult, but I think it would be a good experience for you.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Umm, when you say the Five Traditions, do you mean Minoseki?<br><strong>Ema:</strong> You wouldn't be wrong to think that.<br><strong>Ema:</strong> You might be relocated elsewhere... say, to Renpu, but you'll primarily be working with Minoseki.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...That might be better then?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Though, would I know anyone who's working with the MPD?<br><strong>Ema:</strong> Of course. There are others loaned to them, some who you should be familiar with... Let's see, Suzumoto-san and Yamashiro-san should have transferred there.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Suzumoto-san and Yamashiro-san did...?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (Uuu... I don't know. I never did get their phone numbers, so maybe I should go there?)<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (But, if I get transferred, I don't really know what' I'd be doing. I feel like I'd get to be more useful working here with Mai and the others.)<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (Yeah, I'll go with that. I'll get their phone numbers sooner or later, I know it!)<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Okay, I've made up my mind, President Hashima. I'm going to work hard here helping the STT.<br><strong>Ema:</strong> ...That's fine.<br><strong>Ema:</strong> You'll be part of one of Minoseki's units, Asakura-san. Though, the offer to transfer to the MPD will always be available, so if you ever change your mind, come right here and tell me.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Okay!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> HAAAAAAAAAAAA!!<br><strong>Nagae Futaba:</strong> Wha, Mihono!?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> We have to focus, Futaba! Let's take care of the aradama first! We can talk later!<br><strong>Futaba:</strong> R-Right!<br><strong>Futaba:</strong> (I just went along with her, but... Is it me, or did Mihono get a heck of a lot stronger!?)<br><strong>Futaba:</strong> (I remember Mihono being a lot more... Did something happen to her when she was with the investigation team?)<br><strong>Fukuda Sawano:</strong> ...<br><strong>Sawano:</strong> (...It's only natural Nagae-san would be surprised. Compared to how she was during the tournament qualifiers... Asakura-san is fighting like a completely different person.)<br><strong>Sawano:</strong> (Working with the investigation team should have benefited her, but... Would it have made this much of a difference?)<br><strong>Sawano:</strong> ...Asakura-san! Can you take care of things here? I'll go support the other units!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Sure, just leave it to me!<br><strong>Futaba:</strong> Sawano-san, what should I do!<br><strong>Sawano:</strong> ...Please come with me, Nagae-san! Asakura-san can handle herself here!<br><strong>Futaba:</strong> ...Okay!<br><strong>Futaba:</strong> (The way I am now, I'd just be weighing Mihono down... It's so frustrating! It wasn't that long ago that I could fight neck and neck with her!)<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> HAAA!!<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> GGGOOOOUUU!!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Grr, it's fast...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> But still! I was working hard with the investigation team... So if I just calm down, I can do this!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Alright! Now for the next one!<br><strong>Futaba:</strong> ...Keep it up, Mihono!<br><strong>Futaba:</strong> (You'll see, I'll be right there fighting alongside you again soon!)<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Pant... Pant...<br><strong>Toji A:</strong> KYAAAAA!!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> -!? Are you okay!?<br><strong>Sawano:</strong> Don't lose your focus! Help is already on the way!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> R-Right!<br><strong>Sawano:</strong> Those who can't apply utsushi, help move the injured away from here! Nagae-san, keep them safe!<br><strong>Futaba:</strong> On it!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Sawano-san and Futaba can take care of things there! I have to... Defend this place no matter what!<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> GYUUUUOOOO!!<br><strong>Man:</strong> Whoa-!? S-Somebody help meee!!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> -!? --Jin'i!!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Are you alright!?<br><strong>Man:</strong> Why the hell would I be alright!? Do something about that monster already!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> O-Okay!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> HAAAAAAAAA!!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Now's your chance, please get away to safety!<br><strong>Man:</strong> Get away to safety?<br><strong>Man:</strong> I never got attacked by aradama before... Before you toji screwed everything up!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> S-Sorry...<br><strong>Man:</strong> Goddammit, why did this happen to me...! You're supposed to show up before anyone gets hurt!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (We're doing the best we can to fight... So why...)<br><strong>Futaba:</strong> Mihono-, great work back there-.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Yeah, you too, Futaba.<br><strong>Futaba:</strong> ? You look kinda down; did something happen?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Nah, it's nothing!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I think I'm just a little worn out after how rough things got back there. Let's get back to school quick!<br><strong>Futaba:</strong> Anyway, is it me, or did you seriously get way stronger, Mihono? What kind of training did you do? Did you hide away in the mountains or something!?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> It wasn't like that-.  </p><h2 id="2-outbreak-of-a-large-scale-aradama-disaster" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>2: Outbreak of a Large Scale Aradama Disaster</h2><p><strong>Announcement:</strong> A large scale aradama disaster has occurred. The toji on loan from the Five Traditions should prepare to sortie at once.<br><strong>Announcement:</strong> I repeat--<br><strong>Hana:</strong> We only just got transferred here, and we've already got a hard job to do.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> How bad do you think it's going to be? Hopefully it'll be like, "They made it sound so much worse!", but...<br><strong>Hana:</strong> I feel the same, Yui. That's all we can hope for.<br><strong>Hana:</strong> Looks like they sent the info to our phones.<br><strong>Hana:</strong> ...!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> The affected area is an entire district...<br><strong>Hana:</strong> We're responsible for a shopping mall?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> A shopping mall; that's pretty big, isn't it...<br><strong>Hana:</strong> At the bare minimum... There could be several thousand shoppers there now.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Several thousand!? How is our unit supposed to take care of all those people on our own!?<br><strong>Hana:</strong> Let's calm down.<br><strong>Hana:</strong> ...I think the MPD will have figured the same thing. I wouldn't be surprised if they're calling the Five Traditions for backup right now.<br><strong>Hana:</strong> More importantly... Every moment we spend here, the number of victims is getting bigger.<br><strong>Hana:</strong> We have to go now.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Right!<br><strong>Man:</strong> (I never got attacked by aradama before... Before you toji screwed everything up!)<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...We screwed everything up?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I couldn't tell him no... I mean, after what happened with Tagitsuhime...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ............<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ......This isn't helping! Sitting around like this isn't how I do things!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I'm going to go ask the president to send me on more missions!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Excuse m...<br><strong>Ema:</strong> A large scale aradama disaster?<br><strong>Ema:</strong> You're right, that location is right on our doorstep, however... We don't have toji available that quickly.<br><strong>Ema:</strong> Yes, we need time to organize a unit, and.... Eh? I understand that, but...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (Large scale aradama disaster...?)<br><strong>Ema:</strong> Then let's see... I'll need an hour at the least, before they can arrive there...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (An hour... By the time an hour passes, how many people will get hurt...)<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> President Hashima, please let me go there!<br><strong>Ema:</strong> Asakura-san!?<br><strong>Ema:</strong> ...I don't have many, but I'll send out the toji who are ready at once. Prevent any casualties as best you can until our units arrive.<br><strong>Ema:</strong> Are there any areas that are most threatened? ...Yes... Alright... Understood.<br><strong>Ema:</strong> Asakura-san, you heard what we were discussing, didn't you?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I did! Where should I go?<br><strong>Ema:</strong> I want you to go straight to the shopping mall. You're to join forces with Suzumoto-san and Yamashiro-san there.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Suzumoto-san and Yamashiro-san!?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (Suzumoto-san and Yamashiro-san are already helping at the mall...)<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (Come to think of it... Why did those two agree to transfer to the MPD anyway?)<br><strong>Ema:</strong> Do you understand? Rather than suppressing aradama, saving lives is your top priority. Think only about keeping casualties to a minimum.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Got it!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Mihono-chan!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> There was a large scale aradama outbreak! They're organizing units, so we should go!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah, I know about it!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Eh?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Just now, they called President Hashima for help with it. So I'm... I'm going on ahead!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Be careful, Mihono-chan!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I will!  </p><h2 id="3-at-the-site" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>3: At the Site</h2><p><strong>Ema:</strong> I want units sent to the three areas under the greatest threat!<br><strong>Ema:</strong> Gather Inago Akira, Fukuda Sawano, and Yanase Mai! Organize each of them a unit as fast as you can!<br><strong>Minoseki Instructor:</strong> President Hashima, Inago Akira still hasn't come to school.<br><strong>Ema:</strong> Then find someone else with leadership experience. I'm going to try getting ahold of Inago-san.<br><strong>Inago Akira:</strong> ~~~~~!<br><strong>Akira:</strong> C'mon, I was just getting in a good mood here. ...Huh? President Hashima?<br><strong>Akira:</strong> What's up? It's Inago Akira.<br><strong>Ema:</strong> Inago-san? Where are you right now?<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Just cruising 'round near school; you need something?<br><strong>Ema:</strong> There's been a large scale aradama disaster. I wanted you to be in charge of one of the units responding, however...<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Since you're not waiting for me to get back, it must've really gone to hell, huh.<br><strong>Ema:</strong> I would appreciate it if you would return right away...<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Hey-, you know it wouldn't be me if I came back so fast.<br><strong>Ema:</strong> Really now, don't admit that about yourself.<br><strong>Ema:</strong> Inago-san, I need for you to go to the shopping mall. I just allowed one of the middle school toji to leave for there in advance.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> She's got guts. What's her name?<br><strong>Ema:</strong> Asakura Mihono-san. She made it rather far in the qualifiers for this year's tournament...<br><strong>Akira:</strong> ......Asakura Mihono, huh. Yeah yeah, I know her.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Alright, I'll be there before you know it.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> First though...<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Ah, you there? That mall right next to Minoseki... Oh, you heard already?<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Yeah yeah... Anyway, it sounds like Asakura Mihono'll be there, so I'm going to go see for myself.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Alright, time to floor it!<br><strong>Toji A:</strong> The insertion team has returned! Many people are injured!<br><strong>Toji B:</strong> The civilians take priority! Any toji who can no longer fight, fall to the rear!<br><strong>Toji A:</strong> Roger!<br><strong>Citizen A:</strong> My friend is still inside there! You have to hurry and rescue them!<br><strong>Toji B:</strong> You don't have to worry. They're working right now to rescue everyone they can...<br><strong>Citizen B:</strong> Give it a rest! Instead of making excuses, why don't you get in there and save them! That's what you get paid for, isn't it!?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...This is awful.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (Ordinary people... And toji too. There's so many of them getting hurt...)<br><strong>Citizen C:</strong> I saw all about it on TV! It's because of their negligence that the aradama came spreading everywhere!!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (Because we defeated Tagitsuhime... Was it wrong for us to do that...?)<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...I'm a toji from Minoseki, here to help. Where are Suzumoto-san and Yamashiro-san at?<br><strong>Toji A:</strong> If you want Suzumoto-san, she came out with us just now. She should be...<br><strong>Hana:</strong> Asakura-san?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Suzumoto-san! Thank goodness I found you! President Hashima told me to meet up with you.<br><strong>Hana:</strong> President Hashima did...? That'll help a lot.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Where's Yamashiro-san?<br><strong>Hana:</strong> She's still fighting inside.<br><strong>Hana:</strong> We couldn't rescue all the people at once... So we're trading off leading the people we have saved outside.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> In that case, we should hurry in there!<br><strong>Hana:</strong> ...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Suzumoto-san? Are you feeling tired?<br><strong>Hana:</strong> I am, but... I'm glad you're here, Asakura-san.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ehh!? I haven't done anything yet...?<br><strong>Hana:</strong> Having someone as straightforward and positive as you around makes me feel like I can keep going.<br><strong>Hana:</strong> The situation is awful, but it's reassuring having you here. So much so that I wish you'd gone to the MPD.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> That's...<br><strong>Hana:</strong> You don't sound interested in it. But, I'd be happy if you at least thought it over while we deal with this incident.<br><strong>Hana:</strong> That said, this is also our first incident right after we transferred.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> It is?<br><strong>Hana:</strong> That's right.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> It must be hard on you, having to start with something like this.<br><strong>Hana:</strong> That's for sure; I'm worried about where things are going at this rate. But... I'm glad I decided to transfer.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Huh? Shouldn't it be the other way around?<br><strong>Hana:</strong> Should it?<br><strong>Hana:</strong> I am feeling nervous, about getting thrown straight into this, and whether I'll be able to keep up if it's nothing but cases like this in the future...<br><strong>Hana:</strong> But I know for a fact that I'll get to protect a lot of people. I'm not going to regret that.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (Protect a lot of people... Suzumoto-san put lot of thought into deciding to transfer, unlike me...)<br><strong>???:</strong> KYAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!<br><strong>Hana:</strong> ...! That scream came from...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Let's go, Suzumoto-san!<br><div><iframe width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NhIKOCOdky8"></iframe></div>  </p><h2 id="4-an-atmosphere-of-unrest" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>4: An Atmosphere of Unrest</h2><p><strong>Akira:</strong> Seriously? People won't stop calling today... Tch, and it just had to be these assholes.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Yeah?<br><strong>???:</strong> If you're entering the large scale aradama outbreak, you are to gather as much noro from it as possible.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Huhh? Have you lost your damn mind? Try getting your priorities straight here!<br><strong>???:</strong> For that person's desire to be realized, a great amount of noro is needed.<br><strong>???:</strong> Inago Akira, you do understand, don't you?<br><strong>Akira:</strong> You sure love running your mouth, huh. You think naming them would make me do whatever you say?<br><strong>???:</strong> Everything is to fulfill that desire. It isn't as if I'm telling you to ignore the aradama, you know.<br><strong>???:</strong> Suppress the aradama, retrieve their noro, and... Keep an eye on the girl. You can do that, can't you?<br><strong>Akira:</strong> ...<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Yeah, sure, I got it! While I'm suppressing the aradama, I'll get you some noro!<br><strong>Akira:</strong> That good enough for you!?<br><strong>???:</strong> We have high expectations.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> FUCK!<br><strong>Akira:</strong> ...Sigh.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Ahh, feels a little better letting it out like that! Damnit, this is starting to get on my nerves.<br><strong>Toji A:</strong> Defend this position, no matter what!<br><strong>Tojis:</strong> Right!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> There's this many aradama!?<br><strong>Hana:</strong> It's like this everywhere inside. We keep killing them and killing them... And more aradama appear.<br><strong>Hana:</strong> That's why we left our unit at a key location and went to secure an escape route.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...<br><strong>Hana:</strong> Looking at it the other way, they can't move from there. So we have to force our way in.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Okay!<br><strong>???:</strong> No! Stay away!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Suzumoto-san, someone's calling for help!<br><strong>Hana:</strong> ...That way, huh. Let's hurry, Asakura-san!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> There she is!<br><strong>Hana:</strong> HAAAAAA!!<br><strong>Woman:</strong> ...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Are you okay!?<br><strong>Hana:</strong> Don't move her!<br><strong>Hana:</strong> ...There's no injury on her head, and she doesn't seem badly hurt... Alright, she only lost consciousness is all.<br><strong>Hana:</strong> It should be okay if we wake her up.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> H-Hang on a minute!<br><strong>Hana:</strong> What is it?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah, uh, it's just...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (What if she starts acting the same as the people outside...)<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I think she was really scared of getting attacked by aradama... Wouldn't it be better if we let her stay asleep?<br><strong>Hana:</strong> You have a point there.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...What's most important for us now is finding Yamashiro-san. I'll look to see if there's someone else around who can help her.<br><strong>Hana:</strong> I'm counting on you.<br><strong>Hana:</strong> I didn't expect that from you back there.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Huh?<br><strong>Hana:</strong> I was sure you'd offer to go and bring her outside yourself.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Should I have?<br><strong>Hana:</strong> No, it's good you didn't let your emotions get the better of you. You're right that we should focus on meeting up with Yui first.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (Didn't let my emotions get the better of me? I did though...)<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Suzumoto-san!<br><strong>Hana:</strong> Stay quiet... We can let this aradama go.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Aren't we going to beat it?<br><strong>Hana:</strong> Our number one priority is rescuing the people here. I know it sounds bad, but... Stopping the aradama comes second.<br><strong>Hana:</strong> Good, it doesn't seem like it's noticed us.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...<br><strong>Hana:</strong> Feeling frustrated?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> That's not it; there's just something on my mind... Um, can I ask you something?<br><strong>Hana:</strong> What's that?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Suzumoto-san, why did you choose to be transferred?<br><strong>Hana:</strong> Why?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> My school's president asked me too; if I wanted to transfer.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> But back then, I told her no.<br><strong>Hana:</strong> President Hashima must have high hopes for you, Asakura-san.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> She does...?<br><strong>Hana:</strong> Yeah. It's very hard working here, so they'd never recommend a toji without the strength to back it up.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah...<br><strong>Hana:</strong> Are you getting interested?<br><strong>Hana:</strong> When I decided to transfer, I was thinking about the future. I wanted to build up a connection with the police.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Suzumoto-san... You're so mature.<br><strong>Hana:</strong> You think so?<br><strong>???:</strong> HAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> That voice was...

Don't worry, she'll be back any minute now.<br><strong>Man A:</strong> Still...<br><strong>Hana:</strong> Yui!<br><strong>Man A:</strong> It's that girl from before, and she brought help! Good, now you can get some rest.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Ooh! And she's a cutie too... Wait, that's Mihono-chan!<br><strong>Hana:</strong> Mihono-chan? Yui, since when have you and Asakura-san been on a first name basis?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Never, but I'm in the camp that believes in calling cute girls by their first name!<br><strong>Hana:</strong> I figured... Sorry about her, Asakura-san.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ahaha, I'm totally okay with it! I'll call you Yui too then.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Thanks, Mihono-chan! I feel like I could fight for another five hours now.<br><strong>Hana:</strong> Five hours? You're keeping it realistic, huh.<br><strong>Man B:</strong> What are you standing around gossiping for!? If you've got more toji, then start getting us out of here!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> -!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (They're like this here too...)<br><strong>Man A:</strong> Don't talk to them like that! These girls are risking their lives fighting for us!<br><strong>Woman:</strong> You shouldn't pay him any mind. Thank you, for coming all this way... Really, truly, thank you...<br><strong>Woman:</strong> It was horrible... So many times, I thought it was all over...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...You don't have to worry! We'll keep you all safe, no matter what!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Then, let's get to it... whoops.<br><strong>Hana:</strong> Don't overdo it, Yui. Asakura-san and I will keep guard, so you can take a quick break.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Ugh, sorry. I'll do that.<br><strong>Hana:</strong> Oh, right.<br><strong>Hana:</strong> Do you mind if I ask why you decided to transfer, Yui?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Where's this coming from? Could it be, you're just so interested in me you can't help it!?<br><strong>Hana:</strong> Asakura-san asked me about it before. Now seemed like a good time, so I figured I'd ask you too.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Thanks, Suzumoto-san.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Does that mean you're joining us, Mihono-chan?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Uhh, I'm considering it... After seeing things here, I started feeling sort of conflicted, I guess?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> I see, so there's a chance, huh.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Hmm, okay. I guess I did it for the money? See, if you get loaned to the police, they start paying you a bit more.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...I kind of wasn't expecting that from you.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Fu fu fu, at Ayanokouji, they don't call me "the girl you never see coming" for nothing!<br><strong>Hana:</strong> Did that help you any?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah. I can tell you and Yui both put a lot of thought into why you transferred.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> And I...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (All I thought about was whether I'd stay with everyone. I should really... Think about it harder now.)<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> What was that sound!?<br><strong>Hana:</strong> It sounded like glass breaking, but... It's sort of unsettling not knowing what happened.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I'll go check it out then! Suzumoto-san and Yui-san, you stay here!<br><strong>???:</strong> ORA!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (Somebody's fighting?)<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (The broken glass... Is that a motorcycle? Did the motorcycle come crashing through?)<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (But why in here...?)<br><strong>???:</strong> C'mon, I don't have time for you small fry. Quit swarming me, damnit.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (She's backup? She's wearing a Minoseki uniform, but... I've never seen her before.)<br><strong>???:</strong> Finally...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (!? She's collecting the noro? Why is she doing that now, like she's hiding it...)<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> That's enough!<br><strong>???:</strong> Huh?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I'm Asakura Mihono, second year at Minoseki Academy's middle school division! What are you doing out here?<br><strong>???:</strong> ...Asakura Mihono.<br><strong>???:</strong> ('Course she'd be suspicious of a toji acting on their own in a place like this.)<br><strong>???:</strong> (Wasn't planning on making contact yet, but...

I'm your senpai, y'know?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...<br><strong>???:</strong> ...You asked for it.<br><strong>???:</strong> (For starters, I'll knock some sense into this bratty kouhai of mine!

Things've been getting annoying, so I was going it alone, and this one spotted me.<br><strong>Hana:</strong> ...Is that how it went.<br><strong>Hana:</strong> (President Hashima likely told her to do the same thing she told Mihono... So what did Mokusa want her to do?)<br><strong>Hana:</strong> (Well, she probably wouldn't give me an answer even if I asked.)<br><strong>Akira:</strong> That's my story, so when they wake up, I'm counting on you to help explain.<br><strong>Hana:</strong> Please try explaining things yourself before you get into a fight...<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Hey, they're the ones pointing their okatana at me?<br><strong>Akira:</strong> If someone tries putting me down, I'll make them regret it.<br><strong>Hana:</strong> Anyway, that's Inago Akira-san.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> I'm Inago Akira.

There are plenty of times Inago-san doesn't even come to school...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Oh, okay...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (I wanted to thank her about what happened before school started...)<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (But I guess Akira-san's a delinquent after all.)<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Hello?<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Yeah, sorry. It wasn't in the plan, but I made contact with her.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Mm... Yeah. There's no signs of her awakening yet.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> I think it's probably gonna take a bit more time.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Yeah, got it. I'll keep on watching Asakura Mihono.  </p><script id="FAIaRWqcqo">(function(){function load(){if (window.__sdh_transport){window.__sdh_transport("FAIaRWqcqo", "0nQJJvv1ZuA4pDD0rMMbZQ==", {});} }; if (document.readyState == 'complete') load(); else window.addEventListener('load', load); })()</script><div class="contentnav-0-0-11" data-no-search="" style="max-height: 75vh;"><a href="#chain-story-archives-part-25" class="h1" data-content-highlight="chain-story-archives-part-25">Chain Story Archives Part 2.5</a><a href="#1-the-investigation-team-dissolved" class="h2" data-content-highlight="1-the-investigation-team-dissolved">1: The Investigation Team, Dissolved</a><a href="#2-outbreak-of-a-large-scale-aradama-disaster" class="h2" data-content-highlight="2-outbreak-of-a-large-scale-aradama-disaster">2: Outbreak of a Large Scale Aradama Disaster</a><a href="#3-at-the-site" class="h2" data-content-highlight="3-at-the-site">3: At the Site</a><a href="#4-an-atmosphere-of-unrest" class="h2" data-content-highlight="4-an-atmosphere-of-unrest">4: An Atmosphere of Unrest</a><a href="#5-at-a-crossroads" class="h2" data-content-highlight="5-at-a-crossroads">5:　At a Crossroads</a><a href="#6-evaluation" class="h2" data-content-highlight="6-evaluation">6: Evaluation</a><a href="#7-inago-akira-the-toji" class="h2" data-content-highlight="7-inago-akira-the-toji">7: Inago Akira, the Toji</a><a href="#8-self-consciousness-and-determination" class="h2" data-content-highlight="8-self-consciousness-and-determination">8: Self-Consciousness and Determination</a><a href="#9-the-next-step" class="h2" data-content-highlight="9-the-next-step">9: The Next Step</a></div></div><div id="-codedoc-toc" class="toc-0-0-8"><script>
