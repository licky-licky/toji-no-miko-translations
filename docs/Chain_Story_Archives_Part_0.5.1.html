Not much time left in our New Year's break, huh. I didn't get to mess around anywhere near as much as I wanted... Hey, Kagari, wanna go have some fun somewhere?<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Why would I go with you, Minato-senpai... Besides, I have my work to do for the Origami family, so no thank you.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Ehh-, then what about if I invite Yukari too? That way you'd have to come along with us. When should we go? Hey-, when do you have some free time?<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> (Sigh, she always forces things to go her way... Honestly, why does she feel the need to involve herself in others' business like this?)<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Minato, I hate to tell you this, but we won't have any time to enjoy ourselves. Starting tomorrow, at Yuzuki-senpai's proposal, we of Renpu Senior High School's Unit One will be undergoing a training camp.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> A training camp!?  
The next day.</p><p><strong>Fushimi Yuzuki:</strong> Seems like we're all here.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Huh? But Ema and Iroha-senpai aren't here yet?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> The two of them are busy with a mission and won't be attending. I thought I told you that yesterday.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Ahaha, you did? I might've been too distracted figuring out what snacks to bring to listen.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> (Sigh... She isn't showing an ounce of stress. Well, it's not as if Minato-senpai's the only one like that...)<br><strong>Sagami Yukina:</strong> Sana, will you look at this! Aren't these pajamas so cute? I bought them just for today, after I heard I would be staying the night with Yukari-onee-sama~.  
<strong>Arami Sana:</strong> Whoa-, that's super frilly... I bet it'd look great on you, Yukina-senpai.<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> Wouldn't it~? Fufu, tonight I'll be sleeping in this, holding hands with Yukari-onee-sama~. I can't wait~!<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> Hiiragi-san, just so you know, the futon next to Yukari-onee-sama belongs to me! I'm not letting you have it no matter what.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Sigh... Sorry to spoil your fun, but Yukari-sama has said she will be sleeping in her own private room.<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> What did you say!? Don't tell me, you're the one who put Yukari-onee-sama up to this...<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Yukari-sama decided upon it herself. And, I'll tell you just so you know, we aren't holding this training camp so you can amuse yourself.<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> I don't need you to tell me that. Anyway, don't you think there are others you should be lecturing instead of me?<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Others I should be lecturing...?<br><strong>Sana:</strong> Wow-, Minato-senpai. Look at all the snacks you're bringing! You think you could share some of that with me-?<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Hmm, then, how about we make a trade? You let me borrow that game you're bringing and it's a deal.<br><strong>Sana:</strong> Eh-!? But I just bought this game! I was only bringing it 'cause I thought I'd be able to 100% it during the camp-!<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> (Sigh... None of them are taking this seriously at all.)<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> (This training camp is an important step in preparing our unit to be strong enough should a great disaster happen... Do they not understand our purpose here?)<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> (No, they must understand it. It's just that, when the time comes, the weight of their duties isn't as heavy as the one I must do. That's why they can be so carefree...)<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Yukari, Yuzuki-senpai, here we go-! TAAAAAAA-!<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> (I wasn't sure how things would turn out at first, but I should have expected this from Minato-senpai. The moment we began to practice, she became so serious it was like looking at a different person.)<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> (Yukari-sama and Yuzuki-senpai too, with the way they can predict each other's movements, the upperclassman team is impressively coordinated. On the other hand...)<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> Hey, Hiiragi-san! Sana! Why are you getting out ahead of me!?  
<strong>Kagari:</strong> You're the one who's moving too slowly. If this were actual combat, that opening would absolutely come under attack.<br><strong>Sana:</strong> Yeah, when it comes down to it, I'm not gonna hold back anything either.<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> Hmph, trying to fight while working with you two is so stupid I'd rather not even try anymore.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Ahaha-! It's like this every time; the three on the underclassman team are so out of sync it's hilarious.<br><strong>Yuzuki:</strong> Yes, I've spotted the greatest issue for us to work through here.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Right. During this camp, our greatest priority should be improving the teamwork of those three.<br><strong>Yuzuki:</strong> I can think of a number of methods, but what do you think we should do for them to improve, Yukari?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> If you ask me, it would be best if we found a way to bring them closer using this camp environment during the brief time we have here...<br><strong>Minato:</strong> In that case, what if we put the underclassman team in charge of tonight's dinner? If they finish a common goal together, won't it deepen their friendship! You three feel the same, right?<br><strong>Sana:</strong> Dinner duty!? Minato-senpai, isn't it more like you just thought it'd be a pain in the butt doing it yourself?<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> The three of us, in charge of dinner? There's a limit to how inefficient you can make this. Since we went to the lengths of coming here, I believe we should spend our time doing more proper training exercises.<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> I don't want to be with these two either. I thought I would finally get to spend 24 hours together with Yukari-onee-sama...<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Yukina, Sana, Kagari, this is an order from your captain. In order to improve your teamwork, you are to carry out this training at once.<br><strong>Sana:</strong> If it's the captain's orders, I guess we don't have a choice but to go with it...<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Yes, once an order is given, we'll carry it out straight away. First, we'll need to do the shopping. Come on, Sagami-san, let's go.<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> Could you not order me around? I'm only going because Yukari-onee-sama told me to.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Can those three actually manage to get along for long enough to go shopping...?<br><strong>Yuzuki:</strong> Being able to overcome that is another part of their training.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> That's right. Now that we've ordered them out, all we can do is wait and believe in them.  </p><h2 id="2-dinner-cooking-fraught-with-trouble" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>2: Dinner Cooking Fraught with Trouble</h2><p><strong>Kagari:</strong> Before we begin buying anything, I think we should first decide on a dinner menu, but what are you two best at cooking...<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Oh? Sana and Sagami-san must have left at some point. Where could they have gone...<br><strong>Sana:</strong> Kagari-senpai, I went ahead and put what I want to eat in the shopping basket!<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Hang on, Sana, you can't only buy this many snacks. You won't be able to eat them all, will you?<br><strong>Sana:</strong> It's all good. Sweets go in a different stomach, right? Besides, if we have to, Minato-senpai and me'll take responsibility and eat all of it!<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Really now... Do you know where Sagami-san went, by the way? I haven't seen her since we came in.<br><strong>Sana:</strong> If you're looking for Yukina-senpai, she's over at the counter there.<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> Fufufu~. Fish broiled in soy sauce, chopped burdock, spinach in tofu salad with white miso dressing; since Yukari-onee-sama loves Japanese style dishes, she'll be so happy.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Wait, Sagami-san, aren't these all pre-packaged side dishes? The mission we were given was to work together, from buying the ingredients to cooking dinner. Just buying them pre-packaged is missing the point.<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> Well, if I tried to work with you two, we'd never finish even if we had all the time in the world.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> But it's our objective here to do something about that. Let's first think up a menu together... Sana, please stop buying any more snacks.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> (Sigh... As disorganized as we are, can we even reach a finished dinner without incident? I'm concerned with what's coming next...)<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> In the end, we never decided on a menu, and only bought ingredients for what each of us wanted to cook. Will this really be alright...<br><strong>Sana:</strong> Huh? Yukina-senpai, you're so good with a knife! It's sorta surprising...<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> A toji uses their okatana every day, so it's only natural.<br><strong>Sana:</strong> Oh yeah. Then, let me try cutting some stuff too.<br><strong>Sana:</strong> Wah-, that's crazy! Vegetables and fish both feel totally different when you cut them. Cooking's actually pretty fun when you give it a shot, huh, Kagari-senpai.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Yes, I know... Wait, hold on, Sana, that fish you're cutting, that's the one I bought for the nimono I was making.<br><strong>Sana:</strong> Eh-!? You should tell me that sooner-. I already chopped it down to bite size pieces.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> There's no use getting upset over what's already done. I'll have to come up with a new dinner menu... Using the ingredients I have left, I can... Eh?<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Sagami-san, right now, what you're cutting, that's the daikon radish I bought to use for making grated radish, isn't it?<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> Oh, it was? My hands were free, so I thought I'd cut it. You should be thanking me then.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> But, when it's cut into such small bits, I can't make grated radish from it...<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> So what!? If you're going to complain, then you should have put your name on it from the start.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> ...<br><strong>Sana:</strong> Kagari-senpai, I just went and cut up the stuff that was around here, but what can I make with this?<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Sana, normally you decide on a menu before you begin cutting anything. Asking me to think of what you can cook in this situation is...<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> Well now, look who's shying away. Isn't it your responsibility to bring this all together, Hiiragi-san?<br><strong>Sana:</strong> Sorry, I also thought you'd be able to pull something together from this, Kagari-senpai... I guess it's no good after all?<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Unbelievable. You two rely on me far too much to get things done.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Yikes-, it's looking even more tense in there than when the training camp started, isn't it.<br><strong>Yuzuki:</strong> I'd planned on staying quiet and seeing how things progressed, but wouldn't it be best to step in soon?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Still, if we simply help them out here, they won't have improved on anything. We should hold off a little longer...<br>    [Minato's stomach growls]</p><p><strong>Kagari:</strong> Is somebody there? Please stop hiding and come out.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Ahaha, you found me out, huh-. Sorry about that, we were just worried so we came to check up on you.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> You seem to be awfully at odds with each other, but do you think you can finish in time for dinner like we agreed on?<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> About that...<br><strong>Minato:</strong> It's growling again. My stomach's so empty I just can't wait anymore-. Kagari-, if you don't make me some food soon, my stomach's gonna growl so hard it breaks.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> You say that, but... I can't come up with anything to make from these carelessly chopped up ingredients.<br><strong>Yuzuki:</strong> You're right, I'm at a loss of what to do here. It'd be a challenge finding a menu that could make use of all these...<br><strong>Minato:</strong> You're kidding... But there's all this food in front of me-.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Ahh-, I got it! I just came up with a crazy good idea!  </p><h2 id="3-the-end-result-of-dinner-is" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>3: The End Result of Dinner is...</h2><p><strong>Yuzuki:</strong> A good idea? Minato, what did you come up with?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Did you think of some way to resolve this situation?<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Yep, yep. And here I'll show you how it's done!<br><strong>Minato:</strong> We'll take the ingredients here, every last one, and toss them in a hotpot!<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Hotpot...? I see.<br><strong>Yuzuki:</strong> That's true, with a hotpot, we can cook a variety of ingredients together into something that tastes good.<br><strong>Sana:</strong> Leave it to Minato-senpai!<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> With a strong enough appetite helping her, even Minato-senpai can come up with a good idea sometimes.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> C'mon~, it wasn't that good.<br><strong>Sana:</strong> Uh, Minato-senpai, that wasn't a compliment.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> At any rate, we don't have much time to prepare dinner, so starting now let's all work together regardless of class.<br><strong>Kagari/Yukina/Sana:</strong> Right.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Kagari, I'll be getting the broth together, so come help me.<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> Yukari-onee-samaa, if you need help, I'll do it for youu~.  
<strong>Kagari:</strong> I don't feel quite right leaving you in charge of the flavor. I know the way they make it in the Origami househould, so I'll help with this.<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> What's with you!? I just want to cook with Onee-sama too, okay!<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Yukina, if you're free, come help me out. We'll chop up the leftover veggies together.<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> Why do I have to be with Minato-senpai...<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Yukina, right now, what we need to do is cooperate to finish making dinner. Please go lend Minato a hand.<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> If you're the one asking me, Onee-sama, then I'll do my best~.  
<strong>Minato:</strong> Hey, now you're looking motivated. So then, Yukina, let's have a contest to see who can chop them up the fastest!<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> Why would we compete... Still, if that's how it is, then there's no way I'll lose.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> (Incredible, as soon as everyone decided on a goal and began to cooperate, the cooking is quickly coming along... That's the effect teamwork has...)<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Whoa-, there's a kotatsu waiting for us-!<br><strong>Yuzuki:</strong> While everyone was preparing dinner, Sana and I got one ready. It looks like the hotpot is done too, so before we begin eating, let's hear an overview of today's efforts from our captain.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> You all did well our first day of the training camp. Our objective at this camp is to improve our teamwork, and...<br>    [Minato's stomach growls]</p><p><strong>Minato:</strong> Yukari-, I can't take it anymore! Can't we talk about this while we're eating? Let's eat already-.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Minato-senpai. Honestly, you're so...<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Though, Minato may have the right idea here. Everyone, go ahead and eat up so you can be ready for tomorrow's practice.<br><strong>Kagari/Yukina/Sana:</strong> Let's eat.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Mmm~, so good~! You can't have winter without a hotpot, am I right?<br><strong>Sana:</strong> Hafu, hafu<em>... That's right!

Onomatopoeia is hard.]<br><strong>Yukina:</strong> Of course they do, because I'm the one who chopped them up. Hafu, hafu... Oh, these slices of fish are delicious too!<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Those would be the fish Sana chopped up by mistake. It turned out for the best not using it to make nimono.<br><strong>Sana:</strong> Eheheh, I guess I was right for getting it wrong then.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Wait-, the three on the underclassman team, they're acting all close out of nowhere digging into the hotpot.<br><strong>Yuzuki:</strong> It's hard to imagine the tense atmosphere they had earlier.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> As they say, those who eat out of the same pot stay close. I'm relieved to see the training camp is already producing results.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> (Oh, I'm glad that Yukari-sama is feeling relieved. I wasn't sure if we would make it for a moment, but we were saved this time thanks to Minato-senpai's idea.)<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> (Thinking on it more, even outside of battle, Minato-senpai helps us out, doesn't she.)<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> (I don't exactly wish to admit it, but, Minato-senpai might be an amazing person after all...)  </p><script id="aILMJAsOSQ">(function(){function load(){if (window.__sdh_transport){window.__sdh_transport("aILMJAsOSQ", "0nQJJvv1ZuA4pDD0rMMbZQ==", {});} }; if (document.readyState == 'complete') load(); else window.addEventListener('load', load); })()</script><div class="contentnav-0-0-11" data-no-search=""><a href="#chain-story-archives-part-051" class="h1" data-content-highlight="chain-story-archives-part-051">Chain Story Archives Part 0.5.1</a><a href="#1-unit-ones-training-camp" class="h2" data-content-highlight="1-unit-ones-training-camp">1: Unit One's Training Camp</a><a href="#2-dinner-cooking-fraught-with-trouble" class="h2" data-content-highlight="2-dinner-cooking-fraught-with-trouble">2: Dinner Cooking Fraught with Trouble</a><a href="#3-the-end-result-of-dinner-is" class="h2" data-content-highlight="3-the-end-result-of-dinner-is">3: The End Result of Dinner is...</a></div></div><div id="-codedoc-toc" class="toc-0-0-8"><div class="content-0-0-9"><p><a href="/tnm-translations/">Home</a></p><div class="collapse-0-0-4 "><script id="LLdZLHsa__">(function(){function load(){if (window.__sdh_transport){window.__sdh_transport("LLdZLHsa__", "aKxVAFZzmSrnhtZ+q9ZJ2w==", {});} }; if (document.readyState == 'complete') load(); else window.addEventListener('load', load); })()</script><div class="label" onclick="this.parentElement.classList.toggle('open')"><span class="text">Main Story</span><span class="icon-font closed">chevron_right</span></div><div class="content"><div class="collapse-0-0-4 "><script id="aqvQhHiMha">(function(){function load(){if (window.__sdh_transport){window.__sdh_transport("aqvQhHiMha", "aKxVAFZzmSrnhtZ+q9ZJ2w==", {});} }; if (document.readyState == 'complete') load(); else window.addEventListener('load', load); })()</script><div class="label" onclick="this.parentElement.classList.toggle('open')"><span class="text">Part 1: Formation</span><span class="icon-font closed">chevron_right</span></div><div class="content"><p><a href="/tnm-translations/docs/1_-_On_the_Other_Side_of_the_Tournament">1 - On the Other Side of the Tournament</a>
