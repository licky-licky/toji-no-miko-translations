Recorded by Ban Tsugumi.</p><p><strong>Today, at 13:</strong>00, Shichinosato Kofuki entered the research lab. I was running late from a lesson, and when I entered the labroom I could tell something was amiss.<br>From what I gathered from my colleagues, for an unexplained reason, Shichinosato Kofuki was in an unusually rough mood. I wasn't quite sure how to approach the situation.</p><p>My colleagues made such comments as "When grins like that, I feel like I'll be her next victim", and "If the higher-ups find out, we'll be in trouble", and "We're going to die".</p><p>But, as far as I could see, the subject wasn't behaving any different than usual.</p><p>Because of this, and because I am the one who has made the most direct contact with Shichinosato Kofuki, my colleagues requested that I attempt to pacify her.</p><p><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Now then, Shichinosato-san, today we have six A- grade aradama for processing from lab 4. Each specimen has particular characteristics involving the surface composition of their bodies.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> They've asked us to experiment with the angle you cut through them with your okatana, so please look over the order sheet for the specifics. After that, let's get to it!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...Sure.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Good work. By the way, you seem to be in an unusually good mood today... Did something nice happen?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Yeah! I had a good dream!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> A dream? That sounds nice. Were you on a date with the one you like or something?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Huh? Don't talk stupid. A good dream's more like... C'mon, you know what I mean!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Like where I get to slaughter lots of aradama-chan, of course!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Of course it was-. But I knew that already-.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> I was downtown... And it was like the world was covered in aradama. I'd cut one and keep cutting 'em and they'd just keep popping out; every time one of them died two more would take its place! More and more and more!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> It was too good! I got to kill as many as I wanted! Just me and aradama-chan!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Ahhh, man! I can't take it anymore! You know what I mean, right!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> No, you lost me right away.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> But I'm relieved to see you're your usual self. Since you're in a good mood, why not keep up this pace? Seize the day, right!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> You know it!<br>--Progress report from research lab 8, in charge of subject Shichinosato Kofuki. Recorded by Ban Tsugumi.</p><p>Today, Shichinosato Kofuki was in high spirits. When the subject was asked why, the reason given was that she had seen a very good dream.</p><p>As far as the details of the dream go, I see nothing of concern. They diverge greatly from what would be considered normal for a girl her age, but it was exceedingly typical for her disposition.</p><p>In addition, from now on, I would like to review all reports being made on subject Shichinosato Kofuki before they are submitted.</p><p>That is all.</p><h2 id="2-no-matter-what-i-love-aradama" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>2: No Matter What, I Love Aradama!</h2><p>In April--</p><p><strong>Voice:</strong> Why not study Kurama-ryu! Founded by the famous Minamoto no Yoshitsune-! Sounds cool, doesn't it! Come on over and change your image!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Tch! It's that time again when everyone's out recruiting the new students...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Year after year, they're annoying as hell. I've gotta get to the research building.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Just wanna play with aradama-chan already...<br><strong>???:</strong> H-Hey, you!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Huh?<br><strong>Tamaki Marie:</strong> I-I'm Tamaki Marie, a toji in the first year of the high school branch.　If you haven't decided on a research discipline yet, feel free to join me in learning Hokushin Itto-ryu...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Get lost...<br><strong>Marie:</strong> Huh!?<br><strong>Watanuki Kazumi:</strong> You there, you're a new student in the middle school branch, aren't you? How would you like to learn the ways of Satsuma Jigen-ryu?<br><strong>Kazumi:</strong> It requires much more dedication to training than any other style, but no other sword will be able to match your gallantry...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...I'm a third year.<br><strong>Nagasaki Sumi:</strong> U-Um...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Seriously? Another one of you?<br><strong>Sumi:</strong> Y-You're a first year too, aren't you? I just joined here, and I'm having trouble finding the dojo, so...<br><strong>Sumi:</strong> Please, could we go there together?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> ......<br><strong>Sumi:</strong> Also, I haven't made any friends yet, so... Ah, and if you like, do you want to learn Jiken Shinkage-ryu together...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Get it through your head already! I'm a third year!<br><strong>Sumi:</strong> Y-You're my senpai!? S-S-S-Sorry!<br><strong>???:</strong> Kofukicchi~!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Go to hell! I said I'm a third yea... Oh, it's you.<br><strong>Fujimaki Minaki:</strong> Hm~, what's wrong?<br><strong>Minaki:</strong> !<br><strong>Minaki:</strong> Ohh! I bet you got mistaken for a first year again, cause you're so tiny! Poor little Kofukicchi!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> And it just keeps coming.<br><strong>Minaki:</strong> Good job pulling through~. Here, I brought some milk for you.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Ooh, I'll take it. Thanks.............. (Gulp)<br><strong>Minaki:</strong> Mmmm, you're so small and cute, Kofukkichi~. (Rub rub)<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...You're as bad as the rest!<br>Inside the research building of Renpu Girls' School, in the aradama processing facility--</p><p><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Where's the next one! Why's the next aradama-chan not in here yet!?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> What's the matter? You're in a bad temper today.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Shut up! Fuck! Everyone keeps treating me like a little kid! Aradama-chan's the only one who gets what I want!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Ahhh, damnit! I love you!

Kofuki-san!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Tch, the sun's barely up and you're already bugging me. What do you want?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> S-Sorry. It's just... There's something I wanted to ask you...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Earlier, Hono-chan and I were talking about what kind of normal clothes everyone wears. So, Kofuki-san, what do you wear when you're not in your uniform?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Ahh...　Then bring me one of those fashion books you've always got piled up on your desk.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> I just pick out whatever though, so don't expect much... Let's see.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Hm? What's up? Ah! You asked about Fukki's fashion? I'm so curious!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I know, right?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Uhh... The stuff I wear is like... This, and this...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> So it really is like the hoodie you usually wear.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Stuff like this too...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> A biker jacket too...? I didn't peg you for it, but I guess you're the cool type?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It seems like it. With that matching undershirt, it'd look really good... These are all clothes I could never wear though...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Oh! These short pants look good... Geh, these are way too expensive though...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Hono-chan, Kofuki-san's fashion level is actually really high...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yep. She's really fashion-conscious...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...And I guess that's it.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I get it now. Kofuki-san's style is boyish and punk fashion. Where do you usually do your shopping?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Huh? I just buy something if it catches my eye while I'm out. Don't have any favorite shops or anything. So wait, this stuff is called punk?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Y-You didn't know that!?<br>Another day...</p><p><strong>Chie:</strong> Kofuki-chan, let's go shopping in town together. Everyone's picking out clothing today.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Huhh? Go do it yourselves!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Well, you see...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> C'mon, Fukki! Come pick out some clothes for me!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Yes! I want to pick up some of your fashion sense, Kofuki-san!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> ...That's how it is.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Ahh...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> So then, are you coming?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> You're such a pain!

Oi, Mihocchi.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ehh, what's wrong with that, Fukki? We all finally agreed to go out and eat together, and now you're acting all stubborn about it.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Look... In the end, food's just...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Oh, I know.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> "Oi, Mihocchi. Food's all the same after it's in your stomach. Doesn't matter what it's like going in. If I don't get to kill some aradama, then I don't give a crap about whatever you wanna do."<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...You were gonna say something like that, right?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Just come eat with us! The ice cream here is super tasty, you know?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> She's right. Come on, Kofuki-chan, pick a flavor!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Tch!<br><strong>Employee:</strong> If you're not sure, we'll let you do a taste test! I recommend our limited time "Cherry &amp; Vanilla Blend"! Try some!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> O-Okay...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Fukki... I don't care how much you liked it, you're not going to be able to eat all that...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I mean, they actually filled a whole bucket for you. I don't think those are meant for just one person?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...Back off! You can't have any!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Fufu, but just look how happy she is. Let's just let her enjoy it~.  
--Half a month later.</p><p><strong>Chie:</strong> Kofuki-chan! We're all going for ice cream again. Are you coming...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> I don't want any...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> But you've been so into it lately? Every day you get one of those buckets tucked in your arms while you eat it all.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Leave me alone... I said I don't want any more ice cream!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Are you sure...?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah, Chii-nee! Apparently, Fukki binges on eating something and then gets sick of it.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> I never wanna see ice cream again...  </p><h2 id="5-cut-it-out-already" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>5: Cut it out Already!</h2><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> Good teamwork, everyone! Ah, Mirja-san! Can you please do some maintenance on Kiyomitsu for me!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Asakura Mihono, I'll teach you the proper way to handle it yourself, so please try to remember. More importantly...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> When we pushed back the aradama without much effort, I was very surprised to see Shichinosato Kofuki obey orders and hang back without giving chase... She's changed, hasn't she?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> She has. It also feels like it's easier to talk to her lately. It's all thanks to Setouchi-san, I think.<br><em>Kofuki kicks a tree</em></p><p><strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...Damnit... I'm getting really pissed off! It's all Chichie's fault!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> I just wanna do my thing and play with aradama-chan, but nooo!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> I mean...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> "That's enough! Please...! You have to take better care of yourself!"<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...Cause she keeps saying stuff like that...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> "You're hurt, Kofuki-chan! None of us are going to overlook that!"<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...And that...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> "I'm so glad... You're safe, aren't you..."<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...And that! She just won't leave me alone!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> I-It's not like... Like I care if she's worried about me. I just don't like seeing her make that sad face is all...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Ahh, damnit! Shit! Chichie! It's all your fault things got so difficult!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Alright! I made up my mind! I'm just gonna do what I want to do from now on! And I'm gonna tell her off so she quits messing with me!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> OI! CHICHIE!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Kofuki-chan?<br><em>Chie pats down Kofuki</em></p><p><strong>Kofuki:</strong> W-What're you... You don't have to feel me up!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> ...Mm, thank goodness, you aren't injured. Your onee-san was just a little worried.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> So, what is it? It's rare for you to come talk to me, Kofuki-chan.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Y-You see...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Yes?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Ah, I d-don't need... D-Don't worry about...

I don't really care about rumors and whatever, y'know?<br><strong>Ruiko:</strong> Even if you aren't interested, you're still a toji at Renpu Girls' Academy, right? And also, I've heard you hang around the research labs a lot.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Well, you're not wrong, but still, human aradama...<br><strong>Ruiko:</strong> It's exciting!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Like I'd know anything.<br><strong>Ruiko:</strong> What, so it was only a rumor after all-?<br><strong>Kazari:</strong> See, that's what I was telling you. There's no way that kind of thing would be real!<br><strong>Ruiko:</strong> You say that, but, if it really was real, wouldn't you be interested, Uiharu?<br><strong>Kazari:</strong> In that case... I think I would, a little...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Then, wanna go see the research labs? I was just about to head over there actually.<br><strong>Ruiko:</strong> Can we!?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Sure, do whatever you want. Though, whatever happens when you get there, it's not my problem.<br><strong>Ruiko:</strong> W-Whatever happens...? Then, are there really human aradama!?<br><strong>Kazari:</strong> S-Saten-san, maybe we should just give up on this...<br><strong>Ruiko:</strong> It sounds interesting! Let's go, Uiharu!<br><strong>Kazari:</strong> Of course it came to this...<br><strong>Ruiko:</strong> ...Gulp. This is the lab from the rumors... Shichinosato-san... Wait, huh?

Aren't you curious, Uiharu?<br><strong>Kazari:</strong> Well, I am a little bit curious...<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> That rumor is completely made up. We don't carry out experiments fusing humans with aradama or the like here.<br><strong>Ruiko:</strong> So that's all-.<br><strong>Kazari:</strong> Then, what kind of research do you do here?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> We gather data on aradama and toji. To put it simply, we have toji fight with aradama, and we collect the resulting data.<br><strong>Ruiko:</strong> Kind of like that?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> ORAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Yes, just like that.<br><strong>Ruiko:</strong> Is it alright for us to watch on for a while?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> It's perfectly fine.

I think it's safe to say something else must have occurred.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Something that would make Fukki scream like that...?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> That's right. ...That aside, "gyaaaaaaa" is just the sort of scream you'd expect from Shichinosato-san, isn't it.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ahaha, you're not wrong. Anyway, let's go see what happened!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Fukki!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> You two're slow. Though, thanks to that, I got to take my sweet time having fun with the aradma-chan.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> This is exactly as predicted so far. So then, what was that scream earlier about?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> What, you heard that?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> When you scream that loud, of course we'd hear it.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Whoops, sorry. I couldn't help myself from shouting. Aghh, just thinking about it pisses me off.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Pisses you off? The aradama?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> You dumbass, Mihocchi! There's no way an aradama-chan'd piss me off!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> What pissed me off was that tree there!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> ...You love aradama, and you hate vegetation. You're very irritable.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Shichinosato-san, I'm slightly concerned for your future.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> I don't get what you're getting at, but I can tell you're making fun of me.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> You seem to be lacking calcium. Would you like a candy?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> I've got milk to drink! And like I'd eat that shady looking candy anyway!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ahaha! You two sure get along-. So, what happened anyway, Fukki?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> This here!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Your jacket?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Oh? It's slightly torn.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah, it is!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> It got caught on that branch.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I see, so that's why. Though, it's hardly a problem, is it? You have lots of similar jackets you can go back and get.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Doesn't matter; what pisses me off pisses me off!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Then, how about next day we have off, we go clothes shopping together?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Clothes shopping?
