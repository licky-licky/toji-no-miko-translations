Ahh, I'm beat.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Having to do makeup lessons right after class ends is just mean... That's when school's supposed to be over.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Fufu. Kanami-chan, Mihono-chan. You're working hard.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> But the harder we work on missions, that just means we spend more time in makeup classes. I'm not really okay with that...!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> They could at least give us a little bit of a break!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I think, even now, they might still be taking into account the rate of missions you're sent on for your makeup classes. Especially since you two often get assigned to suppress aradama.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Even still!?  
<strong>Mihono:</strong> That's too much~...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Maybe you're right. But, if you score well on your tests, I think there's a chance you'd have less makeup classes?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> If you two both try your best, I think you can get even better grades.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Mmm... On tests, huh...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...I think I'd rather do makeup lessons.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> But, it feels good not having to do any more for a while. After sitting down for so long, I want to get some exercise. So how about doing some swordfighting training after this?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah, if that's what you're doing, then I'm going with!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> You might not have extra classes, but we have our workplace experience trip tomorrow. Be careful not to overwork yourselves and sleep in too late, alright?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Huh? Our workplace experience was tomorrow? I totally forgot...!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> We're in the same group, Kanami-chan, so we have to meet tomorrow morning at 8 at the station. You're not allowed to oversleep.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Though, if you're not confident, I can go and wake you up tomorrow.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Then... Please, Mai-chan! I'll probably be alright, but, just in case!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Sure, I'll be there.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Where are you going for tomorrow's workplace experience?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> A Japanese style diner. They open starting at noon.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> At a place like that, Mai-chan'd be a huge help right away!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I don't think there's any way I'll be cooking or anything. I think we're only serving customers and other simple tasks.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I guess you're right.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Where are you supposed to be going, Mihono-chan?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I'll be at a kindergarten.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> A kindergarten teacher, hmm. That might be perfect for you, Mihono-chan.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Right? I bet the kids'll love her.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Eheheh. You think so? For now, my goal is to play with the kids without letting anybody get hurt!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Give it your best shot tomorrow too, Mihono-chan.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Anyway, let's keep tomorrow in mind and do a little training! C'mon, Mihono-chan!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Sure! You're not gonna beat me-.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Me neither!  </p><h2 id="hostess---kanami-end-a-little-about-our-future" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Hostess - Kanami: End]: A Little About Our Future</h2><p><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah, Mai-chan. The customers at the table in the back want another serving of rice. Big helpings for two people!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Alright. Big helpings.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Oh, there's new customers!<br><strong>Kanami/Mai:</strong> Welcome~.  
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I'll take you to your seats, so please wait a moment.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Phew... Past 2 o'clock, you finally start seeing less customers stopping by.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Mmhm. When there was no end in sight at 1:00, I wasn't sure what we'd do, but we somehow made it...<br><strong>Customer's Voice:</strong> Excuse me-. Could I make an order-?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Yes-. I'll be right there.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Kanami-chan, after you're finished serving that, the manager said we could take a break.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Got it-.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> All I was doing was taking orders and delivering food, but it still felt pretty hectic.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> It really did. I'm normally only being served, so I never considered it much, but serving customers was more work than I thought.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> And it was all so new to me, so I was a bit nervous to start.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> It was tough, but the meals they gave us were so tasty.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> After eating that, I felt like I could keep going on and on.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Me too. I can see why customers kept coming in one after another. And also, their uniforms were very cute, with their Japanese taste.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I know what you mean! Wearing something like that was so different, so it was a lot of fun putting it on.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Though, maybe I only felt like that because I was working all day today.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Maybe so.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Have you thought about ever owning a restaurant like that in the future, Mai-chan?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I'm honestly not sure if I want to try owning a restaurant, but I feel like I have to fight to make sure people working that hard every day can live their lives in peace.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Doing this made me reflect on that all over again.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Good point. It's our duty as toji, after all.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> It's still a long ways away, but, when I have to stop being a toji, what should I do?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> For you, Kanami-chan, what about teaching at a swordfighting dojo?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I love swordfighting, so that could actually work!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> But, would I really be able to teach all that well?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> It feels like I could teach more if we actually go okatana against okatana, like when my mother was teaching me.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> If you taught someone, I have a feeling they'd grow into a strong toji.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> And then, after they're strong, they can come back and fight their master! That'd be exciting!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> So, once they got strong enough, you'd fight your own pupils after all.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Of course I would!<br><a href="https://streamable.com/kftrtt">https://streamable.com/kftrtt</a></p><h2 id="hostess---kiyoka-start-im-a-little-bit-nervous-for-now" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Hostess - Kiyoka: Start]: I'm a Little Bit Nervous for Now...</h2><p><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ......<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Everyone did well on today's mission. You should all be sure to get some rest.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> It was rough, going through another day of that many of them-.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> It'd be more fun fooling around if there were always that much-.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> The more aradama there are, the higher Fukki's motivation meter goes up.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Oh yeah, we should all get something to eat after this.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> I don't see why not. We got unlucky with our timing and missed a chance to have lunch.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> We're back at Renpu now, so what next?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> It's hot out, so let's just stay at the lounge here.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I'd be fine with that. But, Kiyoka, do you know any good places to eat nearby?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ......<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ? Kiyoka, are you feeling sick maybe? ...Are you okay?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Eh.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah... I'm not feeling sick or anything. I just kind of had something on my mind.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> We were talking about, if we can't come up with anything else, let's eat a late lunch in the lounge here.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I think eating in the lounge is fine. They just added a new menu a couple days ago too.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Then, that's that! Let's get going!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Sigh...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Your chopsticks are hardly moving. If it's alright, do you want to talk about what's on your mind with me?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I probably should... Is it alright if you hear me out?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> See, next week... I have to go on the workplace experience trip. And I've been worrying and worrying about whether I can do it right...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> What... that's it? Who cares; just do whatever. It's not like messing it up'll kill you.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Honestly... You're so quick to say things like that, Kofuki-san.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> You just worry about stuff too much.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> That's enough, Kofuki-chan. Telling her that isn't going to help her.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Where will you be going for your workplace experience, Musumi Kiyoka?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It's a hotel, or, a ryokan. I'm meant to be working as a hostess... and I'm feeling a little hopeless about it now.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Wait, really? If you're going to a ryokan, you'd get to eat yummy food and stuff, so isn't that pretty lucky?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Mihocchi...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Even if it's only just for that day... If only I could turn into Hono-chan...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Even if you can't be Asakura Mihono, it's important that you take a positive outlook like she has.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Instead of setting out to do all of your work perfectly, why not just aim to do the tasks you want to do well on properly?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> I agree. I don't think they'll be asking for students getting workplace experience to be perfect at their jobs.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> So I hope, while you're working, you can find something you have fun with and that makes you want to keep at it.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I'll try thinking about how to have fun with it like Hono-chan would.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> So wait; it kinda feels like I helped?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You did, so thanks.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> You're welcome then!  </p><h2 id="hostess---kiyoka-end-hopefully-it-goes-well" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Hostess - Kiyoka: End]: Hopefully it Goes Well</h2><p><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Umm, this meal was for the room to the left of the one before--<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> H-Help me, Kiyokaaaaaaaaa!!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...Hyau!? What's the matter, Hono-chan!?  
<strong>Mihono:</strong> The food I was making turned into an aradama!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> What do I do!?  
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ehh!? Why did it do that!? First... W-W-W-We have to calm down...!?  
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...Right! We use our okatana at times like these!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Oh yeah, our okatana!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> This'll do it... in a jiffy!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Wait, Hono-chan!

It was a dream... Sighh... Thank goodness.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That weird dream was probably because I keep thinking about the workplace experience. I was even with Hono-chan, even though we're from different schools.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Maybe I shouldn't have set the AC to shut off on a timer either.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Let's turn the AC on and go back to sleep.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> So then, I thought I was in the middle of my workplace experience, but at the end... You were shooting a fire extinguisher, and everything went white. It was such a weird dream.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> And it woke me up and I couldn't get back to sleep last night. It gave me a lot of trouble.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> So that's why you were yawning before. But still, I know it's a dream, but none of that made any sense.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It's all your fault, Hono-chan-. I mean, how did you turn food into aradama?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> How am I supposed to know! That was the just me from your dream!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Fufu, sorry. By the way, where did you go for your workplace experience, Hono-chan?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> For my one, I went to a kindergarten. But it was pretty fun! I got to play around with the kids, and take a nap.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You seem like you'd be really good at working with kids, after all.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah. We got along great. They told me to come back again, but I'm too busy with missions to stop by.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...It'd be a little hard to fit in, wouldn't it.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah, with school and missions and all. Maybe if I could take time off from class, but there's no way they'd let me.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> When you do your workplace experience in 2 days, it might be hard on you, but give it your best shot. I'm sure you'll have fun with it.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Sure!

This is my first time too, so it does feel fresh.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> See~!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> There are no longer any signs of aradama in the area of the ryokan. Please rest assured.<br><strong>Ryokan Proprietress:</strong> Thank you very much. It's such a help, having you two here.<br><strong>Ryokan Proprietress:</strong> Because of you, our guests could go about within the ryokan without starting a panic.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> No matter how many times aradama like that come along, I'll beat them right away, so you don't have to worry about it-.<br><strong>Ryokan Proprietress:</strong> Fufu. Though, we would be worried, if aradama appeared that many times in the short time you're here.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ah! I guess you're right.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Oh yeah. After we put on our hostess clothes, we were going to help out, but, what should we do?<br><strong>Ryokan Proprietress:</strong> The work I'll have you do is nothing more than simple cleaning of the rooms, and a check over their furnishings.<br><strong>Ryokan Proprietress:</strong> We have people hired to take care of the full cleaning, but this is one last check before the guests come through. Whoever is in charge will show you how it's done, so please work along with them.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Okaaay~.  </p><h2 id="hostess---yume-end-for-the-special-menu" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Hostess - Yume: End]: For the Special Menu!</h2><p><strong>Yume:</strong> I thought meeting guests and showing them their rooms felt like what a real hostess would do, but I didn't think, after we did it a couple times, they'd ask us to go pick vegetables next.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> They seem to have a special menu of vegetables grown here on the mountain they own that's served to guests who request it.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> You think this is enough we've got-?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> It might be. It wouldn't be good if we gathered too many at once, so why don't we check with the ryokan for now.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Then, I'll go ask!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> --Though, now that I'm looking closer... Onee-san. Were you picking only mushrooms? ...Why? Do you like them?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> There's no special reason. I just happened to. Though, these mushrooms have grown well.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> You could make a good soup stock from these shiitake, and their thickness would make them good for use in cooking.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I don't like them all that much, but, if the guests like it, it's fine.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> That would be best, wouldn't it.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> You look like you're working hard for the ryokan, Yume.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Maki-onee-san, Suzuka-onee-san!? Why're you here!?  
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> A certain someone was worried to death over you, so we came to see you in the end.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Suzuka... You promised you wouldn't say anything.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Oh, did I?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> You're treating me like a kid again-. You didn't have to worry about me or anything. See, look. I'm doing my job juuust fine.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Yeah, I can tell. Those all look tasty.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I'll be looking forward to enjoying what you've picked for dinner.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> You're having these for dinner!?  
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> We are. We made a reservation just now.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I asked for all four of us, you and Yomi-san included, to sit for dinner together. So stick to your work until then.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Okay! Then, I'm going to get going!<br>The next day--</p><p><strong>Yume:</strong> I wasn't used to doing any of that stuff, but that was pretty fun yesterday.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> It seems like it'd be tough working as a hostess every day. There's a lot of rooms you have to clean and all.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> That was a fairly established ryokan.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Since we were all there, it would've been nice if all four of us could have slept over there together too.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> But, we were only there for that workplace experience thing, so I get that it would've been hard setting up-.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> On top of that, we have work we can't afford to leave undone.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yesterday was truly a spur of the moment arrangement, so we couldn't make preparations. Though, it would be nice if the four of us could do something like that again someday.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Someday for sure!  </p><script id="xEoUBJwUMj">(function(){function load(){if (window.__sdh_transport){window.__sdh_transport("xEoUBJwUMj", "0nQJJvv1ZuA4pDD0rMMbZQ==", {});} }; if (document.readyState == 'complete') load(); else window.addEventListener('load', load); })()</script><div class="contentnav-0-0-11" data-no-search=""><a href="#hostess-kanamikiyokayume" class="h1" data-content-highlight="hostess-kanamikiyokayume">hostess kanami/kiyoka/yume</a><a href="#hostess---kanami-start-so-long-as-my-workplace-experience-is-with-mai-chan" class="h2" data-content-highlight="hostess---kanami-start-so-long-as-my-workplace-experience-is-with-mai-chan">[Hostess - Kanami: Start]: So Long as My Workplace Experience is With Mai-chan!</a><a href="#hostess---kanami-end-a-little-about-our-future" class="h2" data-content-highlight="hostess---kanami-end-a-little-about-our-future">[Hostess - Kanami: End]: A Little About Our Future</a><a href="#hostess---kiyoka-start-im-a-little-bit-nervous-for-now" class="h2" data-content-highlight="hostess---kiyoka-start-im-a-little-bit-nervous-for-now">[Hostess - Kiyoka: Start]: I'm a Little Bit Nervous for Now...</a><a href="#hostess---kiyoka-end-hopefully-it-goes-well" class="h2" data-content-highlight="hostess---kiyoka-end-hopefully-it-goes-well">[Hostess - Kiyoka: End]: Hopefully it Goes Well</a><a href="#hostess---yume-start-yumes-work-experience" class="h2" data-content-highlight="hostess---yume-start-yumes-work-experience">[Hostess - Yume: Start]: Yume's Work Experience!</a><a href="#hostess---yume-end-for-the-special-menu" class="h2" data-content-highlight="hostess---yume-end-for-the-special-menu">[Hostess - Yume: End]: For the Special Menu!</a></div></div><div id="-codedoc-toc" class="toc-0-0-8"><div class="content-0-0-9"><p><a href="/tnm-translations/">Home</a></p><div class="collapse-0-0-4 "><script id="cZJAqOInwj">(function(){function load(){if (window.__sdh_transport){window.__sdh_transport("cZJAqOInwj", "aKxVAFZzmSrnhtZ+q9ZJ2w==", {});} }; if (document.readyState == 'complete') load(); else window.addEventListener('load', load); })()</script><div class="label" onclick="this.parentElement.classList.toggle('open')"><span class="text">Main Story</span><span class="icon-font closed">chevron_right</span></div><div class="content"><div class="collapse-0-0-4 "><script id="LywafrEunh">(function(){function load(){if (window.__sdh_transport){window.__sdh_transport("LywafrEunh", "aKxVAFZzmSrnhtZ+q9ZJ2w==", {});} }; if (document.readyState == 'complete') load(); else window.addEventListener('load', load); })()</script><div class="label" onclick="this.parentElement.classList.toggle('open')"><span class="text">Part 1: Formation</span><span class="icon-font closed">chevron_right</span></div><div class="content"><p><a href="/tnm-translations/docs/1_-_On_the_Other_Side_of_the_Tournament">1 - On the Other Side of the Tournament</a>
