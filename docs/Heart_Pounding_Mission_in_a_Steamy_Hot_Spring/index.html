It&#x27;s hard to get across, so I went with whatever works.]</p><p><strong>Chie:</strong> I&#x27;m sorry to call you out here so suddenly, Ellen-san, Yui-chan.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Don&#x27;t worry about a thing! For you, Chie-san, I&#x27;d come running through hell or high water!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> That&#x27;s right, Chie.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> I&#x27;m glad to hear that then.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> It doesn&#x27;t sound like you called us here to play around. Is this a mission?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> That&#x27;s right. Someone needs to suppress aradama that have infested a hot spring.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Oh! A hot spring?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Count me in-!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> First we can wash off the tiredness from getting there, then we can wash off the tiredness from getting rid of the aradama!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> About that, from the sound of things, the aradama have taken up in the source of the springwater.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Because of that, they can no longer maintain the spring, so no one is allowed in.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Oh no!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> No one can enter the springs...? That&#x27;s big trouble!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> It seems like it. This month is the busy season for the inn, so the aradama are stopping their business.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> ...I won&#x27;t forgive them.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> A hot springs inn without a hot spring is just an inn!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> We have to stop these aradama as soon as possible!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> It&#x27;s a bit of a long trip, so why don&#x27;t we meet back up after getting our things together? Would that be alright?<br>
<strong>Ellen/Yui:</strong> Sure-!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Let&#x27;s see... Mm, that should be everything. I&#x27;m all set.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> &quot;I&#x27;m finished here. How are things with you two?&quot; Sent.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> ...Ah, they already replied. Hmm, oh, it seems like they&#x27;ll take a little longer.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> That leaves me with some free time, but... What to do?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> I ended up coming to the meeting spot early. Well... It&#x27;s better than showing up late.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Huh, Chii-nee? What&#x27;re you doing with that suitcase?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Are you going on a trip?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Just a bit of a long distance mission that came up.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> It could end up taking the rest of the week, so I needed a few changes of clothes.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ehh!? So you won&#x27;t be here this weekend!? That&#x27;s too bad...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I wanted to go on a sweets tour with you... But I guess we can&#x27;t now?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Nnn... When you use those puppy dog eyes of yours, Mihono-chan...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> But... I&#x27;m sorry. No matter how much I hurry, I probably won&#x27;t be back before the weekend is over...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Really... Okay! Since it&#x27;s a mission, I know you can&#x27;t help it!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Who are you going with?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> That&#x27;d be me!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> And me too!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Yui and Ellen-san! Huh, I wouldn&#x27;t expected you guys to get grouped together.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Think again, Mihono-chan! You see, Ellen-san and Chie-san both have an overwhelming motherly nature in common!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Mmm, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m much of the motherly type. I&#x27;m an onee-san after all...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> No no, look, you two have such huge motherly attributes right there!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> I see, our breasts, huh. I think you&#x27;d get along with Nene, Yuiyui.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I&#x27;ve heard the rumors too. I&#x27;d like to have a nice long chat with Nene someday!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Looks like a fun team though, Chii-nee.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Fufu, I agree.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="2-neither-doctors-nor-springwater-can-cure-lovesickness"></a>2: Neither Doctors nor Springwater (Can Cure Lovesickness)<a class="hash-link" href="#2-neither-doctors-nor-springwater-can-cure-lovesickness" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> Hmm, what do I do now...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Good morning, Hono-chan.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah, morning, Kiyoka.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I heard you groaning back there. Did you forget to do your homework?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Nah, I finished all of it this time. But that&#x27;s not it, Chii-nee left on a long assignment yesterday.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Oh, I heard about that from Yui-chan.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> She said &quot;There&#x27;s a big aradama infestation, so it could take until the start of next week! Sorry, I won&#x27;t be able to play with you this weekend!&quot;<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Did you have plans to do something with Yui?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> No, we didn&#x27;t talk about anything.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ahaha, that&#x27;s Yui alright.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Actually, I was thinking of going somewhere with Chii-nee this weekend!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Oh, so that&#x27;s why you looked so disappointed.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah. What were you going to do this weekend, Kiyoka?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Have you made any plans yet?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I was planning on visiting a hot spring with a senpai from my school.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> We started talking about it a long time ago.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> A hot spring!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Sounds nice. Do I know that senpai of yours? If it&#x27;s okay with you two, I&#x27;d want to tag along!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Mmhm, you know them. It&#x27;s Juujou-san.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> If you want to go with us... It doesn&#x27;t hurt to ask, so why don&#x27;t we go talk to her together at lunchtime?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Okay!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Juujou-saaan!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Kiyoka? I was looking for you. There&#x27;s something I wanted to ask...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Hey, it&#x27;s Kaoru-san.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> I&#x27;m guessing you two wanted to talk about the same thing. You want to go to the hot spring too?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Yep, that&#x27;s right! Are you going too?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Ellen was busy and I had nothing else to do, and that&#x27;s when I heard about this trip.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Hey, we&#x27;re totally in the same boat! Hot springs are the best, aren&#x27;t they?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> You get to soak in the water, and eat great food, and play table tennis.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Table tennis... I&#x27;m pretty good at that, you know?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I&#x27;m not about to lose either!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...Umm, the hot spring we were planning on visiting doesn&#x27;t actually have table tennis there.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ehh!? There&#x27;s no table tennis...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> But I still feel like competing, so why don&#x27;t we play it now?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Pass. Listen up, Mihono. Table tennis is always fun when there&#x27;s a hot spring to get in nearby.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> But if we do it here, we&#x27;d only be working up a sweat.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Isn&#x27;t working up a sweat a good thing?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> It&#x27;s just tiring. Without a hot spring to cure that tiredness, table tennis loses half its appeal.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Isn&#x27;t that a different appeal though? But if they don&#x27;t have table tennis, we can always think up some other kind of exercise.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> A bigger workout gets another pass. Table tennis is just barely at the acceptable level of exercise. Ideally, it should be something we can do in our room.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Then... How about a pillow fight?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I think we&#x27;d need a few more people than just the four of us for a good pillow fight.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> We can think about what we&#x27;ll do later. For starters, we need to tell the inn we&#x27;re bringing more people.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Please do... Ah, what about ghost stories?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Ghost stories? I&#x27;ve never done that before, but is telling scary stories really that interesting?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It&#x27;s interesting because it&#x27;s scary! And aside from ghost stories, we can talk about love too!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Talk about love...!?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> That&#x27;s about as standard as it gets, but... Does any of us even have a partner?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Just putting this out there, but I don&#x27;t.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> A-As if I have someone like that!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I don&#x27;t think I do either. Besides, what&#x27;s more important now is our duty as toji!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> That&#x27;s right, well said, Mihono!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I don&#x27;t either... So I guess we should tell scary stories after all.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ughh... So that&#x27;s how it&#x27;ll be. I&#x27;m not great with scary stories...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Fufufu, get yourself ready, Hono-chan. I&#x27;ll have a lot of scary stories in store for everyone!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="3-a-waste-of-ones-efforts"></a>3: A Waste of One&#x27;s Efforts<a class="hash-link" href="#3-a-waste-of-ones-efforts" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> We can&#x27;t go in the spring?<br>
<strong>Landlady:</strong> I&#x27;m very sorry. Because aradama appeared in the source of the springwater, we can&#x27;t maintain it anymore...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> But we came all this way... What should we do?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> There&#x27;s nothing to think about. We should just exterminate those aradama.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I agree with Juujou-san!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> And after we beat the aradama, we can get in the hot spring. It&#x27;s two birds with one stone.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...You&#x27;re right. We came this far, so we can&#x27;t leave without getting in the water!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> You all look like you made your minds up.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Are you against this, Kaoru?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> It seems like a lot of work.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...That&#x27;s how I feel, but somebody&#x27;s got to do this. I&#x27;ll go along with you guys.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> I&#x27;ve never seen you put up that little resistance before.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> It&#x27;d be way more annoying coming out here and not even getting in a hot spring, after all.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Seems like a lot of work though.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Then that&#x27;s settled. Where is the spring&#x27;s source?<br>
<strong>Landlady:</strong> It&#x27;s up that mountain...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Ah, that way? Good, we can leave now.<br>
<strong>Mihono/Kiyoka:</strong> Yeah!<br>
<strong>Nene:</strong> Ne-!<br>
<strong>Landlady:</strong> P-Please wait. It&#x27;s dangerous if you leave right now. The sun will be setting soon, and the forecast said the snowfall tonight will be terrible.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Snow up on a mountain at night...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I&#x27;m worried that we won&#x27;t be able to stop the aradama.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> It can be dangerous up on a snowy mountain if you&#x27;re not used to it. What do you want to do?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Let&#x27;s see...<br>
<strong>Landlady:</strong> U-Um, three toji had already set out to suppress the aradama before you arrived...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> What?<br>
<strong>Landlady:</strong> I&#x27;m sorry, I should have told you right away.<br>
<strong>Landlady:</strong> They took care of the aradama in town yesterday, and today they went to the spring&#x27;s source...<br>
<strong>Karou:</strong> If there&#x27;s already toji dealing with it, why don&#x27;t we just wait here and see how things go tonight?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> They might even be suppressing the aradama right now.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> I can&#x27;t deny that, but... What do you two think?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I think we should do what Kaoru-san says and wait here tonight.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Fighting in the dark and snow... It sounds sort of scary...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> If I had to say, I think I&#x27;m with Kiyoka on this.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> It&#x27;s three against one, Hiyori.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> I-I never said I was against waiting here!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> We&#x27;ll stay here at the inn tonight! Got that!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> This is something that actually happened to my mother... It was in... That&#x27;s right, it was an inn just like this one.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Gulp.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> My mother went on a trip with some friends to a hot spring. They got in the spring, ate a good meal, and relaxed... Before they knew it, it was 10 at night.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Hey, that&#x27;s almost just like us here.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> D-Don&#x27;t make unnecessary comments in the middle of the story!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> You getting scared-?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> N-N-N-Nobody&#x27;s scared! Kiyoka! Just keep going!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> &quot;The water was so nice, wasn&#x27;t it?&quot; &quot;Want to go get back in?&quot; As they chatted like that into the night, they heard a voice from the other side of the sliding door.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> &quot;Would any of you guests like a massage?&quot;<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> That&#x27;s sexual harassment.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> No, apparently it was a woman&#x27;s voice. My mother refused, and they didn&#x27;t hear from the voice again.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> But... It was strange.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Wh-What was?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> They heard the voice from the other side of the sliding door, right? But on the other side of that... There should have been a locked door.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Eek...!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> My mother and her friends quickly realized it. &quot;Eh? What does that mean? We did lock the door, didn&#x27;t we?&quot;<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> &quot;...Should we go check?&quot;<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Oh, there&#x27;s a death flag.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...Gulp.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> They found their courage and slid open the door. But there was no one there.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Th-The lock! Did they lock the door or not!?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It still seemed to be locked. They looked out through the peephole and couldn&#x27;t see anyone in the hallway.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> W-Well then there wasn&#x27;t anyone there, was there.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> My mother and her friends thought the same thing, and started feeling safer. But, at that moment, they heard a knocking at the door.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Like...<br>
<strong>Hiyori/Mihono:</strong> GYAAAA-----!!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Who&#x27;s at the door this late? Did you attract a real ghost by telling scary stories?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> A-A-A-As if something like that could happen! Ghosts are just a silly superstition!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> If they&#x27;re not real, then you go answer the door, Hiyori.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> W-Wait! R-Rock paper scissors...! We&#x27;ll decide who answers it with rock paper scissors!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I can&#x27;t afford to lose...! Where there&#x27;s a will, there&#x27;s a way!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I don&#x27;t think you need to be so serious about this...<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Then, here we go... Rock paper scissors!<br>
<strong>Everyone:</strong> Shoot!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah, I lost. I&#x27;ll be right back.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Hello, who is i... KYAAAAAAAAAAA!!<br>

<strong>Ellen:</strong> There&#x27;s a lot more of them than I expected.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> We can handle that many no problem! Just have to wipe &#x27;em out with a BANG!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> And when we get back, the hot spring will be waiting!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> ...What do you think, Ellen-san?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> We don&#x27;t have to push our luck here. Snow, night, and the mountains would be a bad mix.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> I agree. We located the aradama, so we should head back for today.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> So we returned here, and the landlady told us more toji had arrived.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> And I was surprised to see you, Kaoru! Why did you come?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Just a coincidence. Me and Mihono joined in on the hot springs trip Hiyori and Kiyoka planned.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ehh, you didn&#x27;t tell me anything about that.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Eeep! Don&#x27;t look at me!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> But, now I have Kiyoka-chan with me, so all&#x27;s well that ends well!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Warm me up, Kiyoka-chan! Pant, pant, sniff, sniff!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I don&#x27;t want a hug-!? Just- let- go- please-!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...Is it okay to let her do that?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Kiyoka and Yui are really friendly, so it&#x27;s okay!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Anyway, I&#x27;m glad it wasn&#x27;t a ghost. Right, Juujou-san!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> A ghost?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> I-It&#x27;s not important!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Uuu, they forgot about me... Somebody, helppp...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Anyway, it&#x27;s good to see that you three were the toji they sent out.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> We&#x27;ll be joining you tomorrow.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> That&#x27;d be a big help! We were worried about what to do, since there were so many aradama!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Fufu, we can take care of them together and then all join in back at the hot spring.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Sounds nice, Chie! Nothing takes off the fatigue like a hot spring!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Hooray-! They say good things come in pairs, and I see plenty of pairs around me!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> [peaceful sleeping]...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> [heavier sleeping]...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> [homosexual sleeping]...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> They&#x27;re all asleep.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> They had to march their way through a mountain in the snow. They must be worn out.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...Yui-chan was actually tired.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Um, is there anything we can do to help them?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Besides going to eliminate the aradama together?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Yes! Like, for example... Getting a nutritious meal ready for them!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> We&#x27;re at an inn, you know? I&#x27;m sure the people here can make something better than us.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Why don&#x27;t we ask them to make their favorites for them at least?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That sounds nice too...!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Also, why don&#x27;t we take care of the aradama ourselves?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> That&#x27;s what we were going to do at first anyway, right?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> We hadn&#x27;t decided on that yet... But no, that could work.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Should we do that?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Nnn... Kaoru... That&#x27;s not a kanpyou maki... That&#x27;s chikuwa.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> What kinda dream is that. Anyway, why don&#x27;t we all just go together?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...I agree with Hono-chan and Juujou-san.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Heh, three against one, is it?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Fine then, I&#x27;ll go.<br>

They asked the landlady to make our favorite food, then went ahead to deal with the aradama!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="5-all-things-in-moderation"></a>5: All Things in Moderation<a class="hash-link" href="#5-all-things-in-moderation" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> I wonder if the landlady made their favorite foods after all.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I don&#x27;t think we have to worry about that. It was short notice, but I&#x27;m glad she was willing to hear us out.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Agreed. I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re eating their fill right about now.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Yawn... If we were back at the inn, we&#x27;d be in the middle of breakfast now, huh. Never thought I&#x27;d be getting up this early on a hot springs trip.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> You can take all the time you want in the spring after these aradama are cleared out.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Let&#x27;s keep moving.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> According to the map, this should be the source, but...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> They&#x27;re all over.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ten... Twenty... Thirty... There&#x27;s too many to count!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Way too many. Too much for us to deal with by ourselves.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ......You&#x27;re right. Instead of acting cool, we should send a message back. ...Does anyone have signal?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Just barely, but I can get through.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Good. Kiyoka and Mihono, you should move around softly so the cold doesn&#x27;t get to you.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Okay!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Uuu, it&#x27;s so cold, Hono-chan. If only we&#x27;d brought some hot tea with us.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I know, right? When it&#x27;s this cold, you... Ah... Ah...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ACHOO!!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Idiot! Why&#x27;d you have to go and sneeze at a time like this!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ughh, I&#x27;m sorry-!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Tch, they noticed us!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Wh-What do we do now!?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> We don&#x27;t have a choice... Kiyoka, stick with me!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah, o-okay!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> So that means you&#x27;re with me, Mihono.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Got it!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Come on, here we go!<br>
<strong>Nene:</strong> Ne-!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> We should have told them just how many aradama there were.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Even if it&#x27;s a little dangerous, they were only worried about us.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> I&#x27;m glad they felt that way, but... As an onee-san, there are some times you have to get angry.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> They said they&#x27;d hide out and wait for us to get there, so it&#x27;s not like you have to get mad at them, right?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> A good call! That was smart of them, wasn&#x27;t it!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> ...Did you hear something just now?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> I did. It sounded like someone was fighting...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> No no no! It didn&#x27;t sound &quot;like someone&#x27;s fighting&quot;, that is someone fighting!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> We have to hurry!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> There&#x27;s just too many aradamaaa...<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Watch your head, Mihono!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Awawa!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Damnit, where&#x27;d all that energy you had at the start go?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Sorry... I ran out of concentration...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Hyaah-!?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Tch! Hang in there, Kiyoka!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Uuu... I can&#x27;t do anything, against all of them...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Oh! Looks like a hard fight! Chie, let&#x27;s back them up!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Ellen-san, you go to Mihono-chan and Kaoru-san. Yui-chan, you come with me!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Right!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Kaoru-! I&#x27;m here to rescue you-!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Ellen? We&#x27;re saved!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> You okay, Kiyoka-chan?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Chie-san! Yui-chan!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Juujou-san, leave Kiyoka-chan to Yui-chan and I.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Alright, watch after her. HAAAH!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Guess that&#x27;s the end of them. Ahh, I&#x27;m beat.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> That&#x27;s a big win!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Thank you, Chie-san.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Fufu, I&#x27;m your onee-san after all. Don&#x27;t mention it.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Thanks... Ellen, Chie, Yui. You saved us.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Think nothing of it! Let&#x27;s just race back to the spring!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah-!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="6-greater-than-the-sum-of-its-parts"></a>6: Greater Than the Sum of Its Parts<a class="hash-link" href="#6-greater-than-the-sum-of-its-parts" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Ellen:</strong> Now for the hot spring!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> We just came in from the cold, after all. We should warm up before we get sick.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Ahh, finally, we can get in. Come on, Nene.<br>
<strong>Nene:</strong> Nene-!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Fufu, it&#x27;s been a while since we took a bath together, Mihono-chan.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I&#x27;ll wash your back for you, Chii-nee.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Okay, I&#x27;d appreciate it.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Mihono-chan, behind Chie-san... Guhe, guhehe...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Kiyoka-chan, why don&#x27;t we try that too?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I refuse!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> BWHAA-!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Blood came spewing out of Yui&#x27;s nose!?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Pant, pant... J-Just ignore that, l-let me wash your... BWHAA!!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> It did it again!?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> You might have a thin nasal membrane, Yuiyui. It&#x27;s probably best if you stay out of the hot spring.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> But that&#x27;s too cruel!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Why don&#x27;t you try calming down a little for now? Here, come here.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Chie-san&#x27;s are... This close to me... BWHAA!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Kyaa!? Ellen-san, help me get her out of here!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Got it!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I&#x27;m spent... Nothing&#x27;s coming out anymore... Gagh.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> That&#x27;s fine, then you won&#x27;t be getting your nosebleed in the water.<br>
<strong>Nene:</strong> Nene-.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Ahh... Feels like I came back to life. Some kanpyou maki would hit the spot right now.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Kanpyou maki... Should we ask the landlady for some?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Maybe later... Anyway, come on in, Mihono. The water&#x27;s great.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Okay! ...Ahhhh, it&#x27;s so warm.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Feels better because of how cold it was out on the mountain. Makes it all worth it.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ahh, sorry I messed things up for us, back there.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Eh, all&#x27;s well that ends well. No point overthinking it when we were gonna fight anyway.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Okay, thanks, Kaoru-san!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> What are you talking about now, Kaoru?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Nothing much. Anyway, what happened with Yui?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> She&#x27;ll be fine; we spoke to the landlady. When she&#x27;s feeling better she can join us.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> With that settled... Nnn-! Nothing beats an hot spring after a mission!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> I know. Swinging an okatana around like that is always so hard on your back and shoulders, isn&#x27;t it?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> What are you talking about...? Phew, I can feel the springwater soaking in.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...Um, Yui-chan was sound asleep in the dressing room... What happened?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> It sounds like Yui has thin nasal membranes and needed some rest.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Her nasal membranes...! Then I guess we should just let her sleep, right!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Anyway, you all gave me a scare this morning. I never thought you&#x27;d go and leave without us.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> I know! It&#x27;s rude of you to leave your friends behind like that, Kaoru!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Hey, you know I wanted to sleep in. But Kiyoka here wouldn&#x27;t stop until we did something to help you guys out.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Awawa! I-I didn&#x27;t mean for it to get out of hand like that, but you all looked so tired, so I just wondered if there was something we could do to help...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Well, thank you very much, Kiyoka!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You&#x27;re welcome... (bubble bubble)<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Kiyoka... Are you embarrassed?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...Just a little, maybe.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I sensed something sort of yuri happening, so Yamashiro Yui is back in action-! Everyone, come let me wash your... BWHAA!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> So much for back in action.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Honestly, someone&#x27;s going to have to keep watch over her.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Why does this have to happen to me... Just try a little harder, my nasal membranes-!!</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations/edit/docs/Heart_Pounding_Mission_in_a_Steamy_Hot_Spring.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_2_ui" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_3DPF"></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"></div></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_35-E thin-scrollbar"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#1-being-too-polite-would-be-impolite" class="table-of-contents__link">1: Being Too Polite Would be Impolite</a></li><li><a href="#2-neither-doctors-nor-springwater-can-cure-lovesickness" class="table-of-contents__link">2: Neither Doctors nor Springwater (Can Cure Lovesickness)</a></li><li><a href="#3-a-waste-of-ones-efforts" class="table-of-contents__link">3: A Waste of One&#39;s Efforts</a></li><li><a href="#4-somethings-better-than-nothing" class="table-of-contents__link">4: Something&#39;s Better than Nothing</a></li><li><a href="#5-all-things-in-moderation" class="table-of-contents__link">5: All Things in Moderation</a></li><li><a href="#6-greater-than-the-sum-of-its-parts" class="table-of-contents__link">6: Greater Than the Sum of Its Parts</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Links</div><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://pastebin.com/LdyviZ8Z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Translator anon&#x27;s pastebin<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Site source code<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Built with Docusaurus.</div></div></div></footer></div>
