I wish you would remember that, Minato-senpai.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> But I do remember!<br><strong>Minato:</strong> I never said I was here to goof off now, you know.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> ...You're right, I'm sorry. What brings you here today?<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Refreshments! I thought you two might be worn out, so I bought something sweet for you.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Something sweet... That sounds nice. What did you buy?<br><strong>Minato:</strong> You know that store that people have been talking about lately? The Japanese sweets place.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> They had so much that it was hard to pick, so I went with something simple and got you mamekan.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> ......Mamekan.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Thank you, Minato. Kagari, it's a little early, but let's take a break.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> ...<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Kagari? Is it too soon for tea?<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Oh, if I'm in the way, then I'll head home. This was really all I stopped by for.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Ah, n-no! I'll get the tea ready right away, so please, Minato-senpai, you can join us!<br><strong>Minato:</strong> ...Hey, Yukari. Is Kagari acting weird to you?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> She was working like normal until just a moment ago... I wonder why?<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Chew chew...<br><strong>Minato:</strong> I guess that's why.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Fufu, it looks very tasty.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> ...? Are you two not going to eat?<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Yeah, I was going to. Cause the way you're eating makes it look so good.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> ...That's because mamekan is delicious.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> You looked real cute while you were eating.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Wha-!? P-Please stop harassing me, Minato-senpai!<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Ehh, but you really did look cute. Right, Yukari?<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Absolutely not! I wasn't cute, was I, Yukari-sama!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> I thought you were cute.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> N-Not you too, Yukari-sama!<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> ...I've had enough! Thank you for the meal!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Oh, are you on a hunger strike now?<br><strong>Minato:</strong> I bought a whole bunch, so eat all you want, Kagari.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> I won't eat any more!!  </p><h2 id="2-a-modest-hobby" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>2: A Modest Hobby</h2><p><strong>Kagari:</strong> The assignment is portraiture...?<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> (What will I do... I don't know anyone I can ask to pose for me...)<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Sigh...<br><strong>Minato:</strong> What's up, Kagari? I heard you sighing about something.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Minato-senpai?<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> (I could ask Minato-senpai... No, could she be capable of modelling for a long stretch of time?)<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> ...It's nothing. What about you, Minato-senpai? Why are you here?<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Your class was assigned to paint portraits, right? I thought I'd let you paint me.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> ...News travels fast, I see. Who told you?<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Just Ema... Anyway, did you find a model yet?<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> No, I'm still looking...<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Then this works out perfect!<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> ...Do you understand what a model needs to do? You're going to have to hold the same pose for a very long time.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Easy peasy!<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> ...Very well, I'll take your word for it. Please help me out, Minato-senpai.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> ......<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Hey, Kagari.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Will the model please be quiet.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> So long as my body doesn't move, it's okay if my mouth moves, right?<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> I guess, but...<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Anyway, show me what it's looking like so far.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> It's a work in progress, so no.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> You're so stingy, Kagari.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> This has nothing to do with me being stingy.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Even if it's you, Minato-senpai, I don't want the model seeing a work I'm not satisfied with.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> You sure are taking this seriously. You love painting that much, huh?<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> ...It's a hobby of mine. Why did you think I love painting?<br><strong>Minato:</strong> It's just, while you're painting, you look like you're having a lot of fun.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> ...That aside, please wait until it's complete. I want to be sure it's finished.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Got it, I'll look forward to it!<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> (...I didn't have to tell her that. But...)<br><strong>Minato:</strong> ...<br><strong>Minato:</strong> (If she'll be quiet, then I don't mind.)<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> ...Phew, it's finished.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Let me see! ...This is how you see me, Kagari? I look way too cool!<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> It's not like I did anything to change your appearance. I just captured how you look...<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Who should I show this to first... I know, it's gotta be Yukari!<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> That's not something I planned on Yukari-sama seeing... She's gone!<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> I don't believe it! Please stop, Minato-senpai!  </p><h2 id="3-the-distance-between-the-two" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>3: The Distance Between the Two</h2><p><strong>Kagari:</strong> Nn... Where am I...?<br><strong>Ema:</strong> [sleeping]<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Ema-senpai?<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> (That's right, Yukari-sama told me to take the day off... And I went along with Minato-senpai and Ema-senpai on their hot springs trip...)<br><strong>Ema:</strong> Nnn...<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> She's sleeping soundly...<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> And Minato-senpai... Hm? She's not here...<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> I'm wide awake now... I may as well go look for her...<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Hup! Hup!<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> ...Minato-senpai?<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Huh... Kagari? What are you doing up this late?<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> That's what I came to ask you. What are you doing out here?<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Practice swings!<br><strong>Minato:</strong> I woke up, and when I looked outside, the moon looks so pretty, doesn't it?<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> I agree, it is pretty.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> And just looking at it makes you want to get in some practice swinging, doesn't it?<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> That I can't understand... Though I do think it's good not to neglect your training.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Ahaha. It's rare for you to compliment me.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> I didn't mean to compliment you specifically...<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Anyway, do you mind if I ask you something?<br><strong>Minato:</strong> So long as you don't mind if I keep practicing.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Why did you invite me to come with you?<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Do you wish I hadn't?<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Yes.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> No hesitation, huh...? But I wanted to go to a hot spring with you, Kagari.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> ...Is that all?<br><strong>Minato:</strong> That's all there is to it. You don't need any other reason to go to a hot spring.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Minato-senpai... You're a strange person.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> You think so? ...Achoo!<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Alright, come on, let's go back. Things would only get worse if you caught a cold.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> You worry too much, Kagari.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> I am not worried about you.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Did you have a good time?<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> ...Well, I think it made for a good break.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Is that so. Well, I'm glad to hear it!  </p><h2 id="4-likedislike" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>4: Like/Dislike</h2><p><strong>Minato:</strong> Kagari! Do you have any plans next time you have a day off? If not, let's go see a movie together!<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> I refuse.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> I have my work to do as Yukari-sama's attendant. Whether I have a day off is irrelevant.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Oh... That's too bad. I'll ask some other time then.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Hey, Kagari! You came at just the right time.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> ...For what?<br><strong>Minato:</strong> See, I was just looking for someone to practice with. Are you free for a while?<br><strong>Minato:</strong> I'm busy.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Oh, well, I'll ask again later!<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Kagari--<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> I am busy!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Fufu, I heard about you two, Kagari. Minato has been following you around, hasn't she?<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> She has. "Are you free now, are you free later", just who does she think I am?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Why not join her once in a while?<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Absolutely not! She's irritating enough as she is now; I refuse to spend any more time with her than I have to!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> ...So you don't like Minato then?<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> ...<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> If it's hard to answer, is that a yes?<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> That's right, I don't like her.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Are you sure?<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> ......<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> To be honest, I don't think I dislike her... That much.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> You here, Kagari?<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> M-Minato-senpai!?  
<strong>Yukari:</strong> At least knock before you come in, Minato. It's bad manners.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Ahaha, my bad, sorry.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> D-Did you...<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Huh?<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Did you hear... Just now?<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Did I hear what... Ah, does that mean you were talking bad about me behind my back?<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> ...Oh.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> We weren't. Right, Kagari?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Right. We were only talking about how irritating you are, Minato-senpai.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> No wait, that's definitely talking bad about me!?  
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Pfft, ahahaha!<br><strong>Minato:</strong> I don't get what's so funny about that!?  
<strong>Kagari:</strong> Neither do I, Yukari-sama!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> I'm just relieved, since you two seem to be getting along.  </p><h2 id="5-start-of-a-relationship" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>5: Start of a Relationship</h2><p>Roughly one week after Kagari began attending Renpu Middle School...</p><p><strong>Yukari:</strong> Kagari, are you getting used to things at school?<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> There haven't been any issues.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> There haven't, huh.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Because I've heard a report you had trouble cooperating with your classmates.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> You did?<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> I'm very sorry to have taken up your time. I'll make improvements so you no longer receive any reports.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Kagari? Doesn't that mean you acknowledge there's been an issue?<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> There hasn't, Yukari-sama.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> It's an issue that I've caused an inconvenience for you, however, there isn't an issue with my behavior at school.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Aren't those the same thing?<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> I'm only attending this school to serve you, Yukari-sama. I don't need to familiarize myself with the others.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> (If I told her to make a friend, I'm sure she would, but it's not the kind of thing she should be ordered to do...)<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> How exactly do you plan on improving the situation?<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> First, with a report to my homeroom teacher. "I will be fine like this."<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> That will probably be enough to resolve the issue.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> I see.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> (Kagari would do that too.)<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> (She has her duty as a Hiiragi... That must be part of why she keeps others at a distance.)<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> (For me to tell her to make friends, when I'm part of the ones responsible...)<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> (Even so, I can't leave her like this.)<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> If I can't, then surely Minato could guide her in the right direction. [mumbled]<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Yukari-sama? I didn't quite hear that?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> I only meant to say, I want you to meet with my friends shortly.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> I am informed of your friends, so there's no need for me to actually meet with them...<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Then when I meet with them, do you always plan on leaving?<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> I... You have a point. I understand.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Who should you meet first? If I called Minato, I'm sure she could be here now...<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Minato... You must mean Fujiwara Minato-senpai, from the Shikishima Bank Siege incident.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Oh, you knew that much already?<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> It's only natural, as your attendant. There are no problems with her.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Very well. I'll call her then.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Yukari, I'm here! You said there was somebody for me to meet?<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> (So this is Fujiwara Minato... She's more ordinary than I expected. I doubt I'll have much to do with her.)<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Nice to meet you, Fujiwara-senpai. My name is--<br><strong>Kagari Joins - Part 1:</strong> Even the Devil Gets Heatstroke<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Cough, cough...<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Your temperature still isn't coming down. How are you feeling, Yukari-sama?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> I told you not to come into the room, Kagari. You can stay away until I've recovered... Cough...<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> But, it's my duty to always serve at your side. I could never leave you...<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> If you come down with my cold during a critical moment, what will we do? If you understand, then leave.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> I understand...<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Sigh... Yukari-sama told me not to come near her, but it's not as if I have the day off. I don't know what I should do...<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Oh, Kagari. What's up? What're you doing standing around sighing out here for?<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> I wasn't sighing about anything...<br><strong>Minato:</strong> You totally were though. A big one, like "haaa~". Wait? Why aren't you with Yukari? She's inside, isn't she?<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> She is, though...<br><strong>Minato:</strong> I got my hands on a tasty cake, so I thought we could eat it together. Want to join us, Kagari?<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> A cake...? Yukari-sama's body is under a lot of stress right now. With her cold, she has to remain in bed...<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Ehh-!? Yukari actually got sick!? I guess it's like they say, even the devil gets heatstroke, ahaha.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> "Ahaha"...? Minato-senpai... Your good friend is in there sick right now. Do you not care at all?<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Of course I care. But, whether I laugh or get upset, it's not going to make her cold go away, is it?<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> You aren't wrong, but...<br><strong>Minato:</strong> So, I feel bad for Yukari, but we're going to have to eat this cake with just the two of us.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> No thank you. I could never take something so delicious for myself while Yukari-sama is in there suffering...<br><strong>Minato:</strong> You're looking a little pale, Kagari. Don't tell me, out of consideration for Yukari, you didn't eat anything today?<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> I wouldn't call it out of consideration... If the master won't eat her meals, then for her attendant to...<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Come on, if you don't eat, then how can you keep up your energy? Here, stop worrying about that and take a big bite. Say ahh~!<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Mmrgh-! (chew chew)...<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Hey, Minato-senpai! Please don't force things into my mouth!<br><strong>Minato:</strong> See, now you're sounding alive again. It's important making sure you eat properly. It'd be nice if Yukari's cold would go away too...<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Oh hey, I know just the thing!<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> What?<br><strong>Minato:</strong> If we cross the mountain behind here, there's a shrine way on the other side that has spring water famous for being able to cure all kinds of diseases. Want to come with me to go bring some back for her?<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Right now...?<br><strong>Minato:</strong> If we go straight away and it clears up Yukari's fever, then you and her can eat a good dinner together, right?<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> I suppose you're right...<br><strong>Minato:</strong> That cake gave you some energy to burn, didn't it? Then quit making excuses and let's go!<br><strong>Kagari Joins - Part 2:</strong> Hiking<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Look at that, Kagari! There's some crazy looking mushrooms growing here~. I bet it'd be awful if you ate one!<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Very likely...<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Ah, it looks like all the plants over there are edible though. Why don't we take some back, as a souvenir?<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Excuse me...<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Hm? What's up?<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> It feels like we have been walking for a long while. Are we really going the right way?<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Hmm, we should have been there by around now. That's weird...<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Ahhh-! There's false strawberries blooming here~! Take a look, Kagari. You can eat false strawberries. Wanna try one?<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> No thank you... Could you please stop finding distractions and lead us where we're going?<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Hey now, don't be like that. We're already out here, so why not enjoy our hiking trip?<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> It's gotten much darker. Is this really the right way?<br><strong>Minato:</strong> We're fine, we're fine. We're just in the shade of the mountain now.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Yukari and me made a sort of garden around here, so there's no way I'm lost. Oh, hey, look up in that tree!<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Up in that bird's nest, it sounds like there's chicks in there! How cute~.  
<strong>Kagari:</strong> (Sigh. I should have gotten a map ready instead of relying on Minato-senpai.)<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Ooh, back in the sun again. And with that, we're here~!<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> There really was a shrine with springwater this deep in the mountains...<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Ahh~, all that walking made me so thirsty. We should grab a drink too.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Gulp, gulp, gulp... Phwaa-, so good! Come on, Kagari, have some.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Gulp... Oh, it is good...<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Right? If we bring this to Yukari, she'll be back on her feet in no time. Here, take this canteen and fill it up for her.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Thank you very much.<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Alright, let's get back to Yukari now.<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Um, Minato-senpai... It took us over two hours to travel up and down that mountain path, didn't it?<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Ah, er, did it really...?<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> So then why did it only take us a short ten minutes to get back from the shrine? Don't tell me you took a detour so you could screw around on the mountain...<br><strong>Minato:</strong> Hey hey, don't worry about the details. What's important is we get this water back to Yukari right away!<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> I can't believe her... Wait for me, Minato-senpai.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> You two got springwater from the mountain out back? Thank you for going out of your way for me. Gulp, gulp...<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> The mountain out back? That's what Yukari-sama said, wasn't it, Minato-senpai? But you said we had to cross way on the other side of the mountain... Why did you lie about that!?  
<strong>Minato:</strong> Sorry, sorry. It's just, even though you weren't assigned to do anything, you wouldn't leave or eat anything, so I was worried...<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> That doesn't make it okay for you to lie to me like that!<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Ah...<br><strong>Minato:</strong> See, after all that walking, your stomach's growling. Better eat up now!<br><strong>Kagari:</strong> Honestly, it's always the same with you... Yukari-sama, please excuse me.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Minato, thanks for looking after Kagari. Now I can focus on resting without having to worry about her.  </p><script id="cTVALfrCnq">(function(){function load(){if (window.__sdh_transport){window.__sdh_transport("cTVALfrCnq", "RucYL8yZBrQVvW++5enLHQ==", {});} }; if (document.readyState == 'complete') load(); else window.addEventListener('load', load); })()</script><div class="contentnav-0-0-11" data-no-search=""><a href="#hiiragi-kagari-episodes" class="h1" data-content-highlight="hiiragi-kagari-episodes">Hiiragi Kagari Episodes</a><a href="#1-mamekan" class="h2" data-content-highlight="1-mamekan">1: Mamekan</a><a href="#2-a-modest-hobby" class="h2" data-content-highlight="2-a-modest-hobby">2: A Modest Hobby</a><a href="#3-the-distance-between-the-two" class="h2" data-content-highlight="3-the-distance-between-the-two">3: The Distance Between the Two</a><a href="#4-likedislike" class="h2" data-content-highlight="4-likedislike">4: Like/Dislike</a><a href="#5-start-of-a-relationship" class="h2" data-content-highlight="5-start-of-a-relationship">5: Start of a Relationship</a></div></div><div id="-codedoc-toc" class="toc-0-0-8"><script>
