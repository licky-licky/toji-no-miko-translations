6-5 One Way Trip
================

## 1: Escape
**Kohime:** [pant pant pant pant]...  
**Nene:** Nene!  
**Kohime:** Mm, the shrine's close.  
**Kohime:** ...Kagutsuchi didn't chase us.  
**Nene:** Nene, ne-!?  
**Kohime:** Yeah... I don't know why. But, right now, we have to go.  
**Nene:** Nene.  
**Kohime:** Ah-- I see the shrine...  
**Kohime:** ...  
**Nene:** Nene?  
**Kohime:** ...I don't think we can make it to the torii. We can't get out from here.  
**Kohime:** What should we do...  
**Nene:** Nenene!  
**Kohime:** You'll protect me? Thank you, Nene.  
**Kohime:** But, that's okay. I can fight a little too. Let's do our best to make it to the bottom.  
**Kohime:** And then... we can see everyone again!  
**Nene:** Ne-!  
**Nene:** NEEEEEEEEEEE-!  
**Aradama:** GUOO!?  
**Nene:** NE!  
**Kohime:** Nene, you're strong... I'll help!  
**Kohime:** YAAAAAAAAAAAA!  
**Kohime:** We couldn't beat them all, but... We should run now, Nene!  
**Kohime:** A little further... A little further to the bottom...  
**Nene:** Nene!  
**Kohime:** !?  
**Kohime:** There's so many...  
**Nene:** ...  
**Kohime:** I don't know if we can make it...  
**Kohime:** But, I wanted to see Mihono again...  
**Hiyori:** KOHIME! NENE!!  
**Kohime/Nene:** !?  
**Kanami:** Are you two okay!?  
**Kohime:** Hiyori... Kanami... and...?  
**Sayaka:** Itomi Sayaka.  
**Sayaka:** We'll stop the aradama. So... it's okay now.  

## 2: The Strongest Allies
**Mai:** ...Myougan!  
**Sayaka:** Mai, where are Kohime and Nene?  
**Mai:** ...They're being chased by aradama.  
**Mai:** They're running while fighting back, I think... I'm not sure if think if can suppress them though? More and 
more keep coming...  
**Kanami:** We have to hurry up and save them!  
**Hiyori:** Right, let's go, Kanami! Sayaka!  
**Mai:** You can't!!  
**Kanami/Hiyori:** !?  
**Sayaka:** ...Mai?  
**Mai:** I saw the results from the tests Hiyori-chan and Sayaka-chan did before.  
**Mai:** If you went now, it would take all your energy just reaching them; there's no way you could keep fighting.  
**Mai:** You wouldn't make any difference.  
**Hiyori:** Still, Mai...  
**Mai:** I'm worried for them too. I promise, I'll let you go as soon as you can save them... so please trust me.  
**Kanami:** Of course! We've always trusted you, Mai.  
**Kanami:** Right, Hiyori-chan?  
**Hiyori:** ...That's right. Just tell us when it's time.  
**Sayaka:** I'll be ready to go any time.  
**Mai:** Okay, thanks.  
**Mai:** (If I get this wrong... We wouldn't just lose Kohime-chan and Nene-chan, but you three too...)  
**Mai:** (So, stay calm... Don't panic... Find the last possible moment!)  
**Kanami:** ...We made it back, Mai-chan.  
**Sayaka:** ...We're back.  
**Mai:** Welcome back! Where are Kohime-chan and Nene-chan...?  
**Hiyori:** ...They're fine.  
**Nene:** Nene-!  
**Mai:** Ow, that's hot!  
**Nene:** Ne!?  
**Mai:** It's alright, it just surprised me a little. So it's hot enough in there to warm you up this much, Nene-chan...  
**Mai:** ...It's good you made it back safe.  
**Kohime:** ...Thank you for saving us. Um...  
**Mai:** I'm Yanase Mai, Kohime-chan.  
**Kohime:** Thank you, Mai!  
**Mai:** Mmhm, I'm just glad you two are alright.  
**Mai:** Sayaka-chan, Kanami-chan, Hiyori-chan. You did great.  
**Sayaka/Kanami/Hiyori:** ...  
**Mai:** ...You three must be exhausted.  
**Kanami:** Yeah. I never thought it'd be that hard fighting in the heat like that...  
**Sayaka:** ...Mm.  
**Hiyori:** Just breathing normally starts to burn your body up from the inside...  
**Hiyori:** It worked because of you, Mai.  
**Mai:** Eh?  
**Hiyori:** If we hadn't listened and ran in then... We wouldn't have saved Kohime and Nene.  
**Kanami:** You always know what's best, Mai-chan.  
**Mai:** Y-You don't have to go that far! Here, hurry up and have some water! And, something for you to eat...  
**Sayaka:** I want cookies.  
**Mai:** ...Okay! I really am glad you all came back safe. I mean it.  

## 3: The Eye of the Storm
**Yukari:** Tell me your report.  
**Kohime:** It didn't work.  
**Kohime:** Kagutsuchi didn't want to listen to us telling her to change her demands.  
**Mihono:** ...Oh.  
**Mihono:** Hey, Kohime. Why did Kagutsuchi... say to kill me?  
**Kohime:** I think it's because she's scared of you.  
**Mihono:** Scared of me...? Is that cause I exorcised her before...?  
**Kohime:** I don't know for sure.  
**Kohime:** I don't know if that's what made her scared, or if there's some other reason.  
**Kohime:** But, I know that Kagutsuchi is scared of toji.  
**Kohime:** Not just scared of fighting toji. She's even scared of talking to you.  
**Kohime:** I think that's why she demanded to kill you.  
**Kohime:** She wants to get Kanayamahime back, but she's too afraid of you.  
**Kiyoka:** She's scared...? I think, I can kind of understand that...  
**Mihono:** Wait; Kiyoka, you're scared of me!?  
**Kiyoka:** N-Not that part!? That's not what I meant!?  
**Mirja:** We can save this for later.  
**Mirja:** More importantly, Kohime. You say that, even with that much power, Kagutsuchi is afraid of toji?  
**Kohime:** Yeah.  
**Kohime:** I'm not scared of Mihono. I'm not scared of Kiyoka, or Mirja, or Chie, or Kofuki either.  
**Kohime:** But, it's not strange for an aradama to be afraid of Mihono. It wouldn't be strange if an aradama was afraid
 of any of you.  
**Kohime:** Because toji kill lots of aradama.  
**Mirja:** ...That's true.  
**Kohime:** I told Kagutsuchi, Mihono's not scary. But...  
**Kanami:** She didn't listen and attacked you...  
**Kohime:** Yeah...  
**Kohime:** She thinks I'm her enemy... because I'm helping Mihono.  
**Yukari:** I see...  
**Yukari:** What were things like at Mt. Choukai?  
**Kohime:** There's a lot of aradama. And, it was very hot. Humans can't be in that heat.  
**Yukari:** Etou, Juujou, Itomi. How did it feel to fight in abnormal temperature conditions?  
**Hiyori:** The heat's definitely a bigger bottleneck than the enemy strength. It wouldn't be possible to fight for long
 in there.  
**Yukari:** ...Alright.  
**Kohime:** Ah, but, it wasn't that hot around Kagutsuchi.  
**Yukari:** Was it?  
**Kohime:** Yeah. I don't know exactly how hot it was, but... I think humans can handle it.  
**Tsugumi:** That's likely out of consideration for Hitakami-san's body, while Kagutsuchi possesses her.  
**Tsugumi:** Even if it wouldn't affect Kagutsuchi herself, Hitakami-san's body is still human after all.  
**Tsugumi:** I suppose Kagutsuchi is keeping a small area around herself hospitable for humans.  
**Yui:** But like, in manga and stuff, isn't it always that your own fire can't burn you?  
**Tsugumi:** There's likely a reason for that. Kagutsuchi is currently incomplete.  
**Tsugumi:** Most of Kagutsuchi's power was exorcised by Asakura-san.  
**Hirona:** ...Basically, you're saying it's more efficient for Kagutsuchi to keep the temperature around her lower.  
**Yukari:** Then if we could only reach Kagutsuchi, fighting would be possible...  
**Kanami:** Well, what if we tried using those things?  
**Mai:** You don't mean...  
**Hiyori:** That again...  
**Sayaka:** The storm armor launch unit.  
**Yukari:** ...That would be possible. If we were to use it, the ones who would go are...  
**Mihono:** ...Please let me go!  

## 4: Ceremonial Attire
**Mirja:** The members of this operation have been decided. To start, our investigation team will be joining.  
**Mihono:** I'll do my best!  
**Kofuki:** If there's aradama-chan to play with, I'm not complaining.  
**Kofuki:** But like, are you coming?  
**Tsugumi:** No, I'll be staying here. We have enough storm armor launch units ready, but it doesn't seem there'll be 
enough ceremonial attire in time.  
**Yui:** Ceremonial attire? Was that something else we'll need for this besides the storm armor launchers?  
**Mirja:** I'm told it's equipment to ward off Kagutsuchi's heat.  
**Tsugumi:** It's not wrong to think about it that way, but... To be more precise, it's equipment that blocks off power 
from the netherworld.  
**Tsugumi:** It's an approach not dealing with the physics of the heat, but the impurity.  
**Kiyoka:** But if we have that, do we still need the launch units...?  
**Tsugumi:** Unfortunately, our testing is still incomplete. In a lot of ways, this is a trial by fire.  
**Kofuki:** So what, it's basically suntan lotion?  
**Chie:** We can't rely on it too much then. But still... It's nice to have something to fall back on.  
**Mirja:** Let's get back to the main topic.  
**Mirja:** Joining us will be Inago Akira and Nitta Hirona.  
**Kiyoka:** What about Toribane-san?  
**Mirja:** Toribane Yuuki is still recovering from her previous injury and will not be joining.  
**Kiyoka:** Oh...  
**Kiyoka:** I'll work even harder to make up for Toribane-san then.  
**Mirja:** I hope so.  
**Kofuki:** Is that everybody?  
**Mirja:** No, in place of Toribane Yuuki, Satsuki Yomi will be joining. That makes everyone.  
**Kofuki:** Huh? Why the hell's Yomi-senpai coming?  
**Mirja:** It seems that Satsuki Yomi grew up with Hitakami Makoto, Inago Akira, and Toribane Yuuki, and has volunteered
 herself for the position.  
**Kofuki:** Grew up with them? Can't even imagine what that was like!  
**Mirja:** ...  
**Mirja:** Are you all aware?  
**Mirja:** By using storm armor launch units in this operation, we don't have a means of retreat.  
**Mirja:** Essentially...  
**Chie:** If we aren't able to destroy Kagutsuchi... In the high temperatures, we wouldn't be able to escape, and we'd 
all lose our lives.  
**Mihono:** That's wrong, Chii-nee.  
**Mihono:** We're not going there to destroy anything. We're going there to talk to a scared and afraid aradama.  
**Yui:** When you put it like that, it's weird, it kinda gets me in the mood for it.  
**Kiyoka:** Will we actually be able to talk to her? Even Kohime-chan couldn't do it.  
**Mihono:** I'm sure it'll work out!  
**Kofuki:** Whatever, so long as I get to have some fun.  
**Mirja:** Honestly, just as we're about to stake our lives on this mission... It really is a relief.  
**Chie:** Fufu, she is.  

## 5: Wait for Us
**Chie:** Is everyone ready to go?  
**Mihono:** when you say it like that, it makes me feel like I forgot something.  
**Yui:** I know what you mean! I think I'll check one more time if there's anybody I forgot to call.  
**Yui:** There's Miku, there's Hana-san...  
**Kiyoka:** ...Are you making your last requests?  
**Yui:** Isn't that a little dark to be joking about, Kiyoka-chan!?  
**Mirja:** You certainly don't seem nervous.  
**Kofuki:** Not like we were nervous from the start.  
**Mihono:** Ah, Kohime!  
**Kohime:** ...  
**Mihono:** ? What's wrong, Kohime?  
**Kohime:** Take me with you.  
**Mihono:** But...  
**Kohime:** I might not be able to help much... But I want to go with you, Mihono.  
**Kohime:** I don't want to have to wait!  
**Mihono:** ...Sorry, Kohime. I can't take you with me.  
**Kohime:** Please, Mihono! I won't get in the way! I'm worried about you!  
**Mihono:** Uhh... But, see, the storm armor launchers?  
**Kohime:** I'm an aradama, so I'll be fine even without those!!  
**Kohime:** I'll go the same way I went before!  
**Mirja:** No, it's unlikely you'll be able to reach the summit that way again.  
**Mirja:** You know that too, don't you, Kohime?  
**Kohime:** I...  
**Mirja:** Kagutsuchi not recognizing you as an enemy played a large part in allowing you to reach the summit last time.  
**Mirja:** Now that she has though, the aradama across the mountain would attack the moment they saw you.  
**Mirja:** In fact, it's highly likely the shrine you used before will have aradama stationed there.  
**Kohime:** ......  
**Mihono:** Thanks for worrying about us, Kohime. But, we're gonna be just fine.  
**Mihono:** So, could you still wait here for us?  
**Kohime:** Fine... But, I want to do something to help Mihono...  
**Yui:** Haa, haa, Kohime-chan's so cute...! Kohime-chan just existing is enough to fill me with energy!  
**Kiyoka:** ...  
**Kofuki:** Do something about that, Mihocchi.  
**Mihono:** Ehh!? What am I supposed to do!?  
**Kofuki:** Like, wasn't there something you wanted to ask Kohime?  
**Kohime:** You wanted to ask me something?  
**Mihono:** Eh? Ahh! Oh yeah, I did! I was wondering if you could talk to Kanayamahime for me!  
**Kohime:** I know about Kanayamahime. That's the aradama inside Mihono, isn't it?  
**Mihono:** Yeah! I want to know what she's feeling right now. Do you think you could tell?  
**Kohime:** I'll try it.  
**Kohime:** .........  
**Mihono:** Did it work?  
**Kohime:** She's not responding.  
**Mihono:** Maybe she's sleeping?  
**Kohime:** I'm not sure... But, I could feel her power there.  
**Mihono:** ...So she's still there. Then, I'm sure it's fine.  
**Mihono:** Mmhm, now I'm not worried anymore! Thanks, Kohime!  
**Mihono:** We gotta go now!  
**Kohime:** Okay, have a safe trip!  

## 6: Come Right Back
**Yume:** It's no fair only Yomi-onee-san gets to go!! I wanted to go too!!  
**Yomi:** I'm sorry.  
**Maki:** ...I know how she feels. I won't say it's unfair, but I wish you had at least consulted us first.  
**Maki:** I never thought you'd offer yourself for this...  
**Yomi:** I'll do that next time.  
**Suzuka:** I'd prefer if there wouldn't be a next time.  
**Yomi:** Alright.  
**Yume:** Hey, can't you trade with me? Yomi-onee-san!  
**Yomi:** I won't do that.  
**Suzuka:** ...Though, aren't your abilities a bad match for Kagutsuchi's flames, Yomi-san?  
**Yomi:** I'm not sure how useful my powers will be, but please let me do this.  
**Yomi:** ...Akira is a close friend. Hitakami-san isn't a stranger to me either.  
**Yomi:** I want to be there for them.  
**Maki:** ...This operation is a last stand. You know if you fail, you're not coming back alive?  
**Yomi:** I know that.  
**Yume:** You really don't know when to give up, Yomi-onee-san.  
**Yume:** Well fine. But you're going there representing the special defense team, so you better do your best.  
**Maki:** Representing the special defense team...?  
**Maki:** That's right, it'd disrespect you to worry about you any more. Take care of Kagutsuchi for us.  
**Suzuka:** Our faith is in you, Yomi-san. Please be sure to keep the others safe.  
**Yomi:** I will.  
**Yomi:** Excuse me.  
**Yukina:** ...  
**Yomi:** How are you feeling?  
**Yukina:** ...  
**Yomi:** I'll change out the water for the flowe--  
**Yukina:** Yomi.  
**Yomi:** Yes?  
**Yukina:** Your face is stiffer than usual; what's bothering you?  
**Yomi:** !?  
**Yukina:** Are you really that surprised? You come here almost every day; of course I can tell.  
**Yomi:** ...  
**Yomi:** ...This might be the last time I can come to see you.  
**Yukina:** The operation to suppress Kagutsuchi is starting, isn't it.  
**Yomi:** It is.  
**Yukina:** ...Origami Akane approached me, asking me to return to my position after I'm discharged.  
**Yomi:** Congratulations.  
**Yukina:** When that happens, I'll have trouble without you there. That's why, you need to come back alive.  
**Yomi:** .........I will.  

## 7: I'm Not Hesitating Anymore
**Yuuki:** We're finally going to save Makoto-nee-sama! Akira-nee-sama! Hirona-san!  
**Yuuki:** I feel terrible that I can't go with you though...  
**Hirona:** There's no other way, since your injury still hasn't fully healed. I'll work even harder for you, Yuuki-san.  
**Akira:** ......  
**Hirona:** ...What's wrong?  
**Akira:** I'm just gonna let you know.  
**Akira:** If it comes down to it... I'll kill Makocchan if I have to.  
**Yuuki:** Nee-sama!? What are you saying all of a sudden!?  
**Akira:** We were gonna do the same thing with Mihono, weren't we.  
**Akira:** I'm not about to... say I can't do the same for Makocchan or anything.  
**Yuuki:** But...  
**Akira:** Makocchan's family to me.  
**Akira:** That's exactly why... I gotta be the one to do it... I gotta be ready if that's what it comes to.  
**Yuuki:** ......  
**Hirona:** ...I've thought this for a long time, but you really are an awkward person, Akira-sann.  
**Hirona:** Well, not just Akira-san, but Makoto-san and Yuuki-san too.  
**Akira:**  ...Can't really deny that. But, this is the only way I know how to do things.  
**Hirona:** ......  
**Hirona:** Are you an idiot?  
**Akira:** Huh?  
**Hirona:** I know Yuuki-san won't say it, so I'll say one more time.  
**Hirona:** Are you an idiot?  
**Yuuki:** Hirona-san...  
**Hirona:** I know you've been feeling responsible the whole time this has been going on.  
**Hirona:** That's just who you are.  
**Hirona:** You were probably thinking it's wrong for you to not take the blame for anything, weren't you?  
**Hirona:** That's why you at least want to take responsibility at the end... Why you want to handle Makoto-san 
yourself, isn't it?  
**Akira:** ...Yeah, you got it.  
**Yuuki:** ...It does sound like Nee-sama. Staying quiet and keeping all the responsibility for herself... Not letting 
me do anything...  
**Yuuki:** You are an idiot, Akira-nee-sama. Why do you try to do everything by yourself?  
**Yuuki:** I'm here... Hirona-san is here.  
**Akira:** ...Would ya shut up already.  
**Akira:** Getting called an idiot by my kouhai really stings.  
**Hirona:** ...I think Asakura-san would be upset if she knew you were using her as an excuse.  
**Hirona:** All we need to think about is saving Makoto-san.  
**Hirona:** Thinking about anything else is inefficient.  
**Akira:** You know I... can't do that...  
**Yuuki:** Why can't you want to save somebody important to you?  
**Yuuki:** I want to save Makoto-nee-sama! I want to sit around and eat with all of us again!  
**Hirona:** Responsibility is something for other people to tell you to take. Don't go taking it for yourself.  
**Hirona:** After all... You are our leader.  
**Akira:** ......I'm not really the leader type.  
**Hirona:** Well you are the type who's much better at using her body than her brain.  
**Akira:** Alright, Hirona. When this's all over I'm putting you in your own hospital bed.  
**Hirona:** Ehh-.  
**Akira:** Though... I'm feelin' way better now!  
**Akira:** For now, I'm gonna try like hell to get Makocchan back!! That's all I'm thinkin' about!  
**Akira:** Is that good enough!  
**Yuuki/Hirona:** Sure!
