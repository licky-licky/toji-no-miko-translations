## 1: Discord
**Kofuki:** Huh\!? Kill Mihocchi and hand her over\!? Is she serious? Kanayamahime's the one she wants, right? What the hell's she asking for that for?  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.  
**Kanami:** It's going to be fine, Mihono-chan\. There's no way we're letting Kagutsuchi get you\.  
**Hiyori:** Kanami's right\. Apparently even Origami Yukari made it clear she wouldn't when they were negotiating\.  
**Hiyori:** So long as we bring down Kagutsuchi, there's nothing to worry about\.  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.Yeah\. Thanks, both of you\.  
**Mihono:** It's just\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** Just what?  
**Mihono:** I feel like, from what I know about Kagutsuchi, she wouldn't say that\. She'd just come take Kanayamahime herself\.  
**Akira:** \.\.\.It's cause of Genzan\. There's no way he didn't teach Kagutsuchi some of his messed up tricks\.  
**Mihono:** Genzan\.\.\. san?  
**Yuuki:** He's an older relative of ours\. "Don't slay aradama\! Aradama are gods\!" He'd tell us that kind of stuff\. He was a little weird\.  
slay  
**Kaoru:** It's not like we've got any proof you still aren't working for that guy\.  
**Yuuki:** We wouldn't lie about that\!  
**Akira:** Give it up, Yuuki\. Nothing we say's gonna convince anybody\.  
**Akira:** We're just gonna have to show them\.  
**Yuuki:** Nee-sama\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** Come on, Kaoru\. Don't be mean to them\. You really do trust them deep down, don't you?  
**Kaoru:** Honestly, it's half and half\. That Genzan guy, Kagutsuchi killed him, right? I heard nobody put up with him besides his followers\.  
**Akira:** \.\.\.You got that right\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.Could I bring something up? We were thinking Genzan-san was manipulating Kagutsuchi, but doesn't this mean that's wrong?  
**Sayaka:** Because she killed him?  
**Mai:** I'm not sure\.\.\. We don't know what kind of aradama Kagutsuchi is, so I can't say either way\.  
**Mai:** But, I think it's clear Kagutsuchi decided Hitakami Genzan wasn't necessary anymore\.  
**Yui:** Hey hey, we don't have to talk about this stuff here\! With all these strong, pretty toji around, we'll take care of Kagutsuchi one way or another\!  
**Chie:** \.\.\.Right\. We'll suppress Kagutsuchi and rescue Makoto\.  
**Kiyoka:** Hang on a minute\. I think we should work separately from those three\.  
**Mirja:** Considering the risks posed to Asakura Mihono, that is one way around it\.  
**Mirja:** However, if it meant losing their support against Kagutsuchi, I can't deny it would put us in trouble\.  
**Akira:** \.\.\.If it makes it any better, just think of me as Mihono's meatshield\.  
**Akira:** Anything that'd happen to Mihono\.\.\. I'll make sure it won't\. I owe you that much\.  
**Mihono:** Akira-san\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** \.\.\.If you mean that, then you have to put Hono-chan before anything else\. Can you do that?  
**Akira:** You don't even have to tell me\.  
**Akira:** (If it came down to it\.\.\. Even if I had to kill Makocchan myself, I'd keep you safe\.\)  
**Akira:** (I know Makocchan'd tell me to do the same thing\.\)  

## 2: Kagutsuchi's Domain
**Maki:** It's\.\.\.  
**Suzuka:** I saw the reports on the elevated heat in the area, but\.\.\. I'd never expected it to be to this degree\.  
**Yume:** Even the trees are on fire\. There's no way we can get in there\.\.\.  
**Maki:** Yomi, do you think you could check things out inside?  
**Yomi:** I can\.  
**Yomi:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Yomi:** I've located several aradama\. I'd imagine they were created by Kagutsuchi\.  
**Yomi:** \!?  
**Maki:** What's wrong?  
**Yomi:** My aradama disappeared\. I don't think they could withstand the heat\.  
**Suzuka:** What should we do now, Maki-san?  
**Maki:** \.\.\.I want to hear what all of you think\.  
**Suzuka:** In my opinion, our only option is to retreat\. We should acquire as much information as possible, of course, but we can't do anything more than that\.  
**Yume:** I think that's all we've got too\. Even if we wait here, it's not like that's doing anything\.  
**Yume:** Plus, it's crazy hot here\. Can't we leave already?  
**Yomi:** Shidou-san, Konohana-san, Tsubakuro-san, please go on ahead\. I'll handle the information gathering\.  
**Maki:** \.\.\.We're counting on you, Yomi\.  
**Yomi:** Right\.  
**Yume:** I wanna have ice cream-\.  
**Suzuka:** We're on a mission now, Yume\.  
**Suzuka:** And besides, this power of Kagutsuchi's\.\.\. It's going to be more trouble than we thought\.  

## 3: A Chain of Concerns
**Kanami:** The Special Defense Team went up first to Mt\. Choukai\.\.\. Did you hear?  
**Mihono:** Yeah, they said it'd be really tough to send people up there\.  
**Kanami:** Y'know, I've been thinking a little\.\.\. Maybe we could get Kagutsuchi to come to an understanding with us?  
**Kanami:** Like with Kanayamahime, and Kohime-chan\.\.\. We managed to get along\.  
**Mihono:** That's just like you, Kanami\.  
**Mihono:** But me\.\.\. I don't think it's going to work with Kagutsuchi\. When I felt Kagutsuchi's strength right up close\.\.\. I could tell, this is different from with Kohime or Kanayamahime\.  
**Kanami:** But, does it really have to be\.\.\.?  
**Kanami:** Though, if we can't even make it to her in the first place, there's not much point talking about it I guess\.  
**Mihono:** That's for sure\.  
**Mihono:** Is there even anything we could be doing now\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** Want to spar or something?  
**Mihono:** Sorry, I'm just not feeling like it\. I think I'll watch some TV\.  
**Announcer:** Now for our next topic\.  
**Announcer:** Miss Origami Akane, Director of the Sword Administration Bureau, has announced the abnormal weather conditions at Mt\. Choukai are being caused by the great aradama Kagutsuchi\.  
**Announcer:** Along with an evacuation order, government officials have stated--  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.  
**Evacuee:** The sky went all red\.\.\. It's a real calamity\. I'm not sure even even the toji are going to be able to do anything about that\.  
**Expert A:** If we can't send toji to reach Kagutsuchi, there's not going to be any way to resolve this situation\. Would there be any way for them to come in  from the air?  
**Expert B:** That wouldn't be easy to pull off\. If the heat caused any kind of trouble, the whole crew would be in danger\.  
**Expert A:** In that case, how about a heat-armored rescue truck?  
**Expert B:** No vehicle that could make it is currently in operation\.  
**Mihono:** How to get toji to reach Kagutsuchi\.\.\. Can we even really do it\.  
**Kanami:** We'll do it; count on it\. Hiyori-chan even told me she got put on a mission to help with that\.  
**Mihono:** She did?  
**Kanami:** Yep\.  
**Kanami:** They'll start by getting as close as they can by car\. After that, they're testing to see if they can reach Kagutsuchi using Storm Armor with a built in heat-resistance\.  

## 4: South With North (1\)
**Hiyori:** Starting our test approach with jin'i\. Let's go, Sayaka\.  
**Sayaka:** Mm\.  
**Suu:** Please do the best you can-\!  
**Hokuto:** Suu, we have to start getting ready too\.  
**Suu:** Hokuto-san\.  
**Hokuto:** What?  
**Suu:** I've been thinking\.\.\. Since Juujou-san and Sayaka-san are here, I don't need to be here, do I?  
**Hokuto:** \.\.\.Suu\.  
**Suu:** I mean, didn't they say it's all a bunch of tough aradama in there\!  
**Suu:** So, wouldn't it make sense to leave that to Juujou-san and Sayaka-san\!? Right\!?  
**Hokuto:** We're not doing that, Suu\.  
**Hokuto:** Now's the time to test every method we can\. Juujou-san and Itomi-san are trying jin'i, and you're here to test how close you can get using utsushi\.  
**Hokuto:** Remember?  
**Suu:** I remember, but\.\.\. When I look at this\.\.\.  
**Suu:** I know I can use utsushi a lot more than most\.\.\. but, just because I can use it a lot doesn't mean it's going to make any difference\.\.\.  
**Hokuto:** Didn't you say you would help with the mission so long as I could be with you? That's why I was assigned to support you\.  
**Suu:** That's because\.\.\. you said this was putting all of Japan in danger\.\.\. I was scared, but I felt like, if there's something I can do to help\.\.\.  
**Hokuto:** I know, and I'm proud of you for feeling that way\. So let's do everything we can until we're done here, alright?  
**Suu:** \.\.\.Okay\.  

## 5: South With North (2\)
**Hiyori:** Asahina-san got in touch\. She says Inami Suu went in\.  
**Hiyori:** But\.\.\.  
**Sayaka:** \.\.\.I know even Suu won't be able to get through\. It's only been a few minutes since we entered Mt\. Choukai, and still\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** Do you think we'll be able to fight in the middle of this?  
**Sayaka:** \.\.\.We can't\.  
**Hiyori:** Jin'i, utsushi, and even the combat gear; it makes you realize none of it was meant for moving long distances\.  
**Sayaka:** Mm\.  
**Sayaka:** And\.\.\. the heat makes it hard to breathe\.  
**Hiyori:** Yeah\. Ever since we came up the mountain, it feels like I'm suffocating\.  
**Hiyori:** Sayaka, let's take a path back where aradama won't find us\. We'll meet up with Inami Suu on the way\.  
**Hiyori:** This test is a failure\.  
**Sayaka:** Understood\.  

## 6: Unstoppable
**Mirja:** The situation isn't in our favor, is it\.  
**Tsugumi:** We're testing lots of things in order to suppress Kagutsuchi, but none of them seem promising yet\.  
**Yui:** Hana-san said they're getting sent around doing all kinds of things; it seems really busy\.  
**Yui:** She also says there's a bunch of hate building up for the Sword Administration Bureau right now too\.  
**Kiyoka:** You heard from her\.\.\.? Where did you get to see Hana-san?  
**Yui:** Nowhere; I called her\! I felt like hearing her voice, so I didn't stop calling until she picked up\!  
**Kiyoka:** O-Oh, that's why\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** We should really do something\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** Mmhm, she's definitely bothering Hana-san\.  
**Mihono:** Ah; I didn't mean that, I meant with Kagutsuchi\.  
**Kofuki:** Like do what? It's not like we can even get to Kagutsuchi, so what the hell're we supposed to do?  
**Mihono:** I know, but that's not the point\! If there's a bunch of people not happy with the Bureau, it's cause everybody's feeling worried, right?  
**Chie:** They must be\.\.\.  
**Chie:** We know just how hard everyone is working towards this\. But, everyday people, they can't tell\.\.\.  
**Chie:** I'm sure they're feeling anxious because it looks to them like the Bureau isn't doing anything\.  
**Mihono:** Couldn't we do something to make them feel just a little bit less worried?  
**Kiyoka:** Hmm, I think that might be easier said than done though\.  
**Kiyoka:** Defeating Kagutsuchi would be the best way\.\.\. but if we can't even get close to her, that'll never work\.  
**Tsugumi:** Worse than not being able to get close, the area affected by Kagutsuchi seems to be growing gradually\.  
**Chie:** Does that mean Kagutsuchi is getting stronger?  
**Tsugumi:** More than likely\.  
**Kofuki:** Aghh; this is going nowhere\!  
**Kofuki:** I'm gonna have some fun with some aradama\! Oi, you're coming with\!  
**Tsugumi:** If I have to\.  
**Mirja:** Acting on our own isn't going to\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** I'm sure that Kofuki-san is feeling anxious too, not being able to do anything\.  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.That might be the case\.  
**Yui:** I do love Kofuki-san when she gets like that too\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** Don't go saying that with a straight face\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.Hmmm, there has to be something we can do\.\.\.  

## 7: Strategy Meeting
**Mai:** Something we can do?  
**Mihono:** Yeah\!  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Hirona:** They say good things come to those who wait, so wouldn't the most efficient method be to save our energy for the right time?  
**Yuuki:** Hirona-san, don't tell me you're feeling sleepy?  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.I'm not sleepy at all\. I'm feeling verry motivated\.  
**Akira:** Coming up with plans was never really our strong suit\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** Are you all a bunch of muscleheads, Inagon?  
**Akira:** Shut up\. This stuff was always Makocchan's job\.  
**Akira:** If you're gonna talk, you better have a plan too\.  
**Ellen:** Sure thing I do-\! Let's put out our own news story and show how hard we're working to clean all this up\!  
**Ellen:** If that makes those who're worried about how things'll turn out just a little bit relieved\.\.\. Everybody'll be happy\!  
**Mai:** First off, we'll need to get permission from the presidents\. Then, I'd like to go take our own photos from up front where everything's happening\.  
**Mai:** Though, it's awfully difficult getting pictures of fighting aradama\.\.\. Hmm, where should we go then?  
**Ellen:** You're right\.\.\. It's not like we could go do a photoshoot attacking Kagutsuchi anyway either\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.We're supposed to stay at school on stadby for beating Kagutsuchi, but I heard it's really busy out there\. Yui said Hana told her all about it\.  
**Mihono:** We'd only need a couple days, so could we go be there?  
**Yuuki:** In that case, I want to go lend a hand at the shelters\! I'm sure they could use more help, and they're probably worried about whether more aradama will come\.  
**Mihono:** \!\! That's it, Yuuki\! Nice idea\!  
**Akira:** Then how about me, Yuuki, and Hirona go\.  
**Mihono:** Wait, hold on\! I'll go too\!  
**Mihono:** I was the first one to bring this up\.\.\. and, I want to do something too\!  
**Akira:** \.\.\.Fine\. Then, it's the four of us\.  
**Mihono/Yuuki:** OKAY\!  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.Understoood\.  

## 8: Not as Things Are (1\)
**Yuuki:** We've arrived\!  
**Yui:** Ooh; I like that look you're giving me\! I'll take it\!  
**Yuuki:** Uwah\!?  
**Chie:** Yui, I know you know better\. You can't startle people by taking their pictures out of nowhere\.  
**Yui:** Ehehe, sorry about that\. But, getting scolded by Chie-san is the best\!  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.Yamashiro-san never changes, does shee\.  
**Mihono:** Yui's always going to be Yui\.  
**Akira:** \.\.\.So, why're Yui and Chie here anyway? What's the deal, Mihono?  
**Mihono:** I told them I was going with you to the shelter, and they said they wanted to come too\.  
**Yui:** Boss\! Mai-chan and Ellen-san made me their cameraman\!  
**Akira:** Yeah, we'd probably need one of those\. So, what about you?  
**Chie:** It would be better to have a chaperone, wouldn't it?  
**Akira:** (\.\.\.Hmph, so basically, you don't trust us\. Well, that figures\.\)  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.What's on your mind, Boss?  
**Akira:** None of your business\. And also, don't you start calling me 'Boss'\. It just feels like you're making fun of me\.  
**Hirona:** Fiine\.  
**Mihono:** Alright then, let's go in there, guys\!  
**Chie:** Ah, hang on a minute\.  
**Chie:** There's one thing I want you to keep in mind\.\.\. I don't think these people are going to be happy to see us\.  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.Yeah, I know\.  
**Child:** Ah-- The tojis are here\!  
**Woman:** Oh, they really are\. Thank you so much, for all your hard work\.  
**Yuuki:** H-Huh? I thought they wouldn't be happy\.\.\.?  
**Man:** The toji are always helping around the shelter, with guarding it and whatever we need\.  
**Man:** What would we have to complain about?  
**Child:** Um\.\.\.  
**Akira:** Nn? What's up? Want some candy?  
**Child:** Were you on TV, Onee-san?  
**Akira:** \!?  
**Woman:** Ah, you're the tamayori toji, Inago Akira-san, aren't you\! And you must be Toribane Yuuki-chan\!  
**Woman:** That's amazing\! With such famous toji here, you could take care of that great aradama in no time\!  
**Akira:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Akira:** (After all that showing off we did\.\.\. sure there'd be people out there thinking tamayori'll take care of it\.\)  
**Akira:** (But, we're not using tamayori anymore\.\.\. There's no way we can give them what they want\.\.\.\)  
**Yuuki:** Nee-sama\.\.\. Are you doing okay?  
**Akira:** You got ten billion years to go before you get to be the one worrying about me\!  
**Akira:** \.\.\.Yeah, just leave this to us\! That great aradama'll be gone before you know it\!  
**Chie:** \.\.\.  
**Chie:** We're going to go patrol the area now and take care of any aradama\! So, everyone, please keep hanging in there\!  

## 9: Not as Things Are (2\)
**Chie:** \.\.\.Mm, you look better now\.  
**Akira:** Huh? What'd you mean, better?  
**Chie:** I mean you, Inago-san\.  
**Chie:** You were acting a little strange before\. I thought maybe getting a breath of fresh air would help\.  
**Akira:** Why would you\.\.\.  
**Akira:** Couldn't you just leave me alone?  
**Chie:** Eh?  
**Akira:** Don't play dumb\!\!  
**Akira:** Those people back there, whose fault you think it is they're stuck in some shelter now? That's all on us Hitakamis\.  
**Akira:** \.\.\.So I figured, they'll hate us for it, but that's what we get\. You're right, they weren't gonna be happy to see us, but I was fine with that\!  
**Akira:** Instead, they loved it\.\.\. Honestly, it made me want to throw up\. But hey, what could I do but swallow it down\!  
**Chie:** \.\.\.  
**Akira:** Why even bother caring about me?  
**Akira:** You don't even trust me, Chie\.\.\. do you? Wasn't that the whole reason you came here with Mihono?  
**Akira:** So just go ahead stop giving a damn about whatever happens to us\.  
**Chie:** You're right\. I was worried about Mihono-chan\. But, as for whether or not I trust you\.\.\. Mmm, I can't even tell myself\.  
**Chie:** I just know that\.\.\. You're all doing everything you can now\.  
**Chie:** Is it really that strange to want to help someone who's trying their hardest?  
**Akira:** \.\.\.You're way too soft, every single one of you\.  
**Chie:** You think so?  
**Akira:** Yeah\.\.\. It's pretty cool\.  
**Akira:** (And that's why\.\.\. Mihono decided she was better off with you than us\.\)  

## 10: The Way the Wind Blows
**Mirja:** It looks like helping with the evacuees went well\.  
**Mihono:** Yeah\! We got to talk to so many of them; it was really fun\.  
**Mihono:** You should come with us next time, Mirja-san\!  
**Mirja:** I'll consider it\.  
**Kiyoka:** By the way, Hono-chan\. Where's Yui-chan?  
**Mihono:** Yui went to go give the pictures she took to Mai\. She was taking a whole bunch, so they'll probably have a hard time picking which ones\.  
**Kiyoka:** Knowing Yui-chan\.\.\. How many pictures did she take that had nothing to do with anything?  
**Mihono:** Yeah, she took way too many\.  
**Mirja:** It's still nice to have good news for a change\.  
**Mihono:** But\.\.\. How's everything going with Kagutsuchi?  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.We haven't made any noteworthy progress\. Right now, we need to be perfectly ready for when the time comes to fight her\.  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.It's really frustrating not being able to do anything else though\.  
**Kiyoka:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** (They're all trying so hard\.\.\. But, what can I do\.\.\.\)  
**Ellen:** There's so many good shots in here\! Thank you, Yui\!  
**Mai:** It's hard narrowing down which ones to use\. Though that's a good thing\. I'm glad we asked you, Yui-chan\.  
**Yui:** Ehehe, I get all warm and fuzzy when you praise me\.  
**Yui:** I tried to take as many pictures and videos as I could\.\.\. Do you think they'll help everybody?  
**Mai:** Mmhm, more than I'd even expected\!\!  
**Mai:** I only planned on using photos at first, bu with this much to work with, it'd be better if we made a video\.  
**Ellen:** Yes\!  
**Ellen:** I'll do my best editing it together-\! Let's make a video for everyone to see\!  
**Yui:** Is there anything else you need help with?  
**Mai:** You've already done so much, Yui-chan\.  
**Ellen:** That's right\! Just let us handle the rest\!\!  
**Akane:** Thank you all for making arrangements with the media\. With your help, this should greatly reduce the criticism of the Sword Administration Bureau\.  
**Konohana Family Representative:** Think nothing of it\. Footage from your toji came in at just the right time\.  
**Konohana Family Representative:** Was that your doing, Akane-sama?  
**Akane:** That was something the students carried out on their own\.  
**Mashiko Family Representative:** Seems like you're bringing up a capable bunch\.  
**Akane:** \.\.\.I'm very proud of them all\.  
**Konohana Family Representative:** Wasn't Yanase Mai-san involved in this as well?  
**Yanase Family Representative:** She's told me she only went as far as preparing the video itself\.  
**Mashiko Family Representative:** It's promising of them to be able to put out something so influential\.  
**Akane:** (The media should be satisfied with this for the time being\. Now if we could only find some way of getting close to Kagutsuchi\.\.\.\)
