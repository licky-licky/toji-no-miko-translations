## 1: Hitakami Genzan
**Akane:** Please begin your report\.  
**Maki:** Yes ma'am\.  
**Maki:** We've finished identifying the ones who pressured Asakura Mihono into awakening Kanayamahime\.\.\. or, Kagutsuchi\.  
**Akane:** You have?  
**Akane:** Thank you for your covert investigation of the Hitakami faction, Yomi-san\.  
**Yomi:** Right\.  
**Maki:** The ringleader is Hitakami Genzan\.\.\. The brother of Hitakami Makoto's grandmother\.  
**Maki:** From the sound of it, even among the rest of the Hitakami faction, Hitakami Genzan's group had a unique ideology\.  
**Akane:** Unique?  
**Akane:** If I'm not mistaken, the Hitakami faction's philosophy is to reduce toji casualties by aradama, even going so far as to make active use of aradama themselves  
**Maki:** Yes\. But, Hitakami Genzan is different\. His philosophy is that\.\.\. aradama should be worshiped\.  
**Akane:** Worshiping aradama\.\.\.? Isn't that completely opposed to the ideals Hitakami Makoto-san advocates?  
**Suzuka:** It was only after the disaster at Sagami Bay\.\.\. after joining Mokusa, that the Hitakami faction became radicalized to the point of pursuing their current policy of making practical use of aradama\.  
**Suzuka:** Originally, they seemed to be more of a Tohoku religious group that worshiped aradama as part of the many Shinto deities\.  
**Akane:** That in and of itself isn't so uncommon\.  
**Suzuka:** That's true\.  
**Suzuka:** They would suppress any aradama that caused harm to people\. Other than that, it seems they wouldn't proactively target aradama, but instead work around them within the bounds of reason\.  
**Suzuka:** Of course, within the group, I'm sure there where those who took their ideology as far as Hitakami Genzan\. But those beliefs never came to the forefront of the Hitakami faction\.  
**Akane:** Was it because of that lack of biased thinking that, as the generations changed, they were able to convert into a toji organization?  
**Akane:** Though, even still, those skewed ideals remained in the faction\.\.\.  
**Akane:** And this Hitakami Genzan has helped them to survive to modern times\.\.\.  
**Akane:** Someone who ordinarily shouldn't have had this kind of influence\.\.\. Perhaps it was due to the untimely passing of the former head of the Hitakami family\.  
**Suzuka:** I believe so\. It doesn't seem the current head was able to keep the faction under control\.  
**Suzuka:** Though, it may be somewhat cruel to condemn her for that\.  
**Akane:** \.\.\.I agree\.  
**Akane:** Were the toji responsible for this also members of Hitakami Genzan's group?  
**Maki:** No, their parents were the ones who were part of it\.  
**Maki:** It looks like they were forcing their own daughters into obedience to Genzan\.  
**Akane:** \.\.\.How could they\.  
**Maki:** Hitakami Gezan, along with those who made up his organization, should be punished severely\.  
**Maki:** But\.\.\.  
**Akane:** You don't need to say the rest\. The toji responsible will be given the benefit of extenuating circumstances\.  
**Maki:** \.\.\.Thank you\.  
**Maki:** The majority of the group has already been taken into custody\.  
**Maki:** Only Hitakami Genzan has gone into hiding, but it won't be long before he's arrested too\.  

## 2: Clear and Clouded
**Hitakami Genzan:** These dogs of the Origami\! Why am I the one put on trial\! Why can they not comprehend the gravity of their sins, exorcising aradama\!?  
**Genzan:** Oi, how much longer before I can meet with Makoto\!\!  
**Bodyguard:** \.\.\.The grounds of the estate are being monitored by the Sword Administration Bureau\. I believe it'd be best not to approach any closer\.  
**Genzan:** And what do you think I pay you for\!\! Do something about this\!\!  
**Genzan:** I need to pass on the teachings of the Hitakami, at any cost\!  
**Genzan:** That is what Makoto is for\! I must see Makoto now\!\!  
**Genzan:** Before the Sword Administration Bureau catches hold of me\!\!  
**Bodyguard:** \.\.\.  
**Genzan:** Why couldn't Makoto or that dead mother of hers understand\.\.\. The great disaster was our retribution for the exorcism of aradama\!  
**Genzan:** Aradama require our due respect\.\.\. Why is it so hard to grasp\!  
**Bodyguard:** What? Understood\.  
**Bodyguard:** Genzan-sama\.  
**Genzan:** What now\!  
**Bodyguard:** I'm told Hitakami Makoto has left the manor by herself\.  
**Makoto:** \.\.\.I\.\.\.  
**Makoto:** \.\.\.Split apart\.\.\.  
**Makoto:** Kanayamahime\.\.\.  
**Genzan:** Makoto\!\!  
**Genzan:** Any minute now, the Sword Administration Bureau will have me\! You are all I have left\!  
**Genzan:** You must correct the Hitakami\.\.\. Right the relationship between humanity and aradama\!   
**Makoto:** \.\.\.Kanayamahime\.\.\.  
**Genzan:** Makoto? What's that you said, Makoto?  
**Makoto:** Take back\.\.\.  
**Genzan:** Will you listen to me\! Why can you not understand the seriousness of our predicament\!\!  
**Makoto:** \.\.\.?  
**Genzan:** Hm? Have you finally felt like hearing me out?  
**Makoto:** \.\.\.\!  
**Genzan:** Nuoh\!?  
**Makoto:** \.\.\.Kanayamahime\.\.\. take back\.\.\.  
**Genzan:** Wh-What did you do\! What was that power\!?  
**Makoto:** \.\.\.What split, from me\.\.\. Kanayamahime\.\.\. take you back\.\.\.  
**Genzan:** Kanayamahime\.\.\. Split from you\.\.\. Those flames\.\.\.\!? It couldn't be\.\.\. The great god Kagutsuchi\!\!  
**Genzan:** But, did Asakura Mihono not destroy Kagutsuchi-sama\.\.\.?  
**Genzan:** Still, that power is proof\.\.\. None besides Kagutsuchi-sama could so freely turn those flames\.\.\.  
**Genzan:** \.\.\.  
**Genzan:** Would you\.\.\. Could you be, Kagutsuchi-sama\.\.\.?  
**Kagutsuchi:** \.\.\.I\.\.\. Kagutsuchi\.\.\.  
**Genzan:** Ohh\! Ohhh\!  
**Genzan:** After so much time\.\.\. At last, my desire can be fulfilled\.\.\.\!  
**Genzan:** Kagutsuchi-sama\! Allow me to serve you\! It's Kanayamahime you want, isn't it?  
**Kagutsuchi:** \.\.\.It is\.  
**Genzan:** If so, please avoid going to the Sword Administration Bureau\. The Hiiragi's\.\.\. Juujou's Hitotsu no Tachi is your natural enemy\.  
**Genzan:** Please entrust it to me\! I will go in your place, and take Kanayamahime from them for you\!  

## 3: A Return to Everyday Life
**Mirja:** Pardon us, Origami Akane-sama\.  
**Akane:** Come on in, investigation team\. \.\.\.I'll report to you the government's ruling on this incident\.  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.Okay\.  
**Akane:** Taking into account the considerable impact the great disaster has had on the world, the government has decided that Kanayamahime and Kagutsuchi's existence will remain secret to all but a select group of toji\.  
**Mihono:** But then\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** What does that mean though?  
**Chie:** Mihono-chan\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** S-Sorry\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** I just kind of want to make sure\.\.\. Can I\.\.\. go back to how things used to be\.\.\.?  
**Yui:** That's right, Mihono-chan\!  
**Kiyoka:** It doesn't have to be like that again, does it\.\.\.?  
**Akane:** Yes\. Asakura-san will not be forced to live under any inconvenience\.  
**Kiyoka:** \.\.\.\!\! That's great, Hono-chan\!  
**Mihono:** I kept thinking, I'd have to go back to that place\.\.\. I mean, Hitakami-san, she told me, I couldn't go back to my old life\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** So I\.\.\. I\.\.\.  
**Akane:** \.\.\.You may feel somewhat constrained, but please return to your normal life\.  
**Mihono:** Thanks so much\!  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.Origami Akane-sama\.  
**Mirja:** What's going to happen to the toji that worked against Hitakami Makoto's orders? So long as they're out there, Asakura Mihono would\.\.\.  
**Akane:** Rest assured\. Nearly all members of that group have already been apprehended\. They no longer have the power to harm Asakura-san in any way\.  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.Why did they ignore what Hitakami-san told them in the first place?  
**Akane:** They had a different way of thinking from Hitakami Makoto-san's\.  
**Akane:** The group being apprehended was led by her granduncle\.\.\. Even among the Hitakami-faction, they had a unique belief: to treat aradama as gods\.  
**Mihono:** They treat aradama like gods?  
**Mihono:** Then, those people, they were trying to get me\.\.\. so they could make Kanayamahime their god\.\.\.?  
**Mirja:** The belief that protection of toji should be most important, and the belief that aradama should be worshiped as gods\.\.\. Surely those two would be incompatible\.  
**Chie:** It seems like they would be\.\.\.  
**Kofuki:** That's great and all, but\.\.\. So? What're you gonna do to Hitakami Makoto and them?  
**Akane:** That all depends on Asakura-san\. Asakura-san, do you intend to press charges against Hitakami Makoto, Inago Akira, and Toribane Yuuki?  
**Mihono:** P-Press charges\!?  
**Kofuki:** Why not; sue the hell outta 'em\! The charges are\.\.\. Uh, what would they be?  
**Mirja:** The attempted kidnapping and abduction of Asakura Mihono\.  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.  
**Mihono:** If it's up to me\.\.\. let's not\.  
**Kofuki:** Huh\!? Don't go soft on them\! What's wrong with letting 'em have it?  
**Mihono:** Is that really being too soft\.\.\.?  
**Mihono:** Back then, I was really freaked out\.\.\. I felt like I'd never forgive them after they tricked me, but\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Akira-san and them\.\.\. When I think about it, they were just trying to make it so less toji got hurt, and I think they were really trying their best\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** If somebody else made them take it too far, and those people are gone now\.\.\. I don't think I should press charges\.  
**Akane:** Very well\. They'll only be punished with a strict warning then\.  
**Mihono:** Thanks for that\!  
**Mihono:** They won't be doing any more tamayori toji research either, right? So I'm fine with this\.  
**Akane:** Research on tamayori toji will be continued under the Sword Administration Bureau's jurisdiction\.  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.You're going to keep it going?  
**Akane:** There are toji unable to return from their tamayori state, in need of medical treatment\. We can't simply stop all the research right away\.  
**Mihono:** \!? \.\.\.I guess you're right\.  
**Akane:** It could even come to the point we'll need to ask for your help, Asakura-san\. Please keep it in mind\.  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.Okay\.  

## 4: Yuuki and Hirona
**Hirona:** \.\.\.Hellooo\. How are you feeling, Yuuki-san?  
**Yuuki:** Hirona-san\!?  
**Hirona:** That's meee, Hirona-sann\.  
**Yuuki:** But, what are you doing here\.\.\.? Weren't you on a mission in Okinawa\.\.\.  
**Hirona:** When I heard that you were in the hospital, I took time off to come here\.  
**Hirona:** Ah, here's your souvenir\.  
**Yuuki:** Even if I'm in the hospital, it's not as if I'm sick or anything\.\.\. But\.\.\. thank you for coming to see me\.  
**Yuuki:** Of course I would\. I didn't get to be here fighting with you when everything involving Kanayamahime was going on\.  
**Yuuki:** \.\.\.It's not like I got to do much of anything either\.  
**Hiyori:** You were working hard enough, Yuuki-san\. You only got hospitalized because of side effects from tamayori\.\.\. right?  
**Yuuki:** I think that's what happened\. But, if I can help out my nee-samas, this is absolutely no sweat\!  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.So you haven't heard\. The Sword Administration Bureau took control of tamayori toji research away from the Hitakami faction\.  
**Yuuki:** \.\.\.They did\.\.\.?  
**Hirona:** Also, Genzan-san's group is being arrested by the bureau\.  
**Hirona:** They're basically done for\.  
**Yuuki:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Yuuki:** That's kind of\.\.\. a relief\. Ever since she became the head of the family, Makoto-nee-sama and Akira-nee-sama always seemed like they were forcing themselves\.\.\.  
**Yuuki:** Because of that man\.\.\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.I know what you mean\.  
**Hirona:** Makoto-san was fighting very hard to unify the Hitakami faction\. Thinking back on it, it must have been stressful\.\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.No, I think we were all stressed by it\.  
**Yuuki:** That's true\.\.\.  
**Yuuki:** Are you going to go see them now?  
**Hirona:** No, I'll be flying right back to Okinawa\.  
**Yuuki:** Akira-nee-sama's calling me?  
**Hirona:** Akira-san\.\.\.? She's going to tell you to do something irresponsible; I'm sure of it\.  
**Yuuki:** She'd never do that; Akira-nee-sama's too nice\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.Akira-san is nice? That doesn't compute\.  
**Yuuki:** Ahaha\.  
**Yuuki:** \.\.\.Hi, it's Yuuki\. What did you need, Akira-nee-sama?  
**Akira:** \.\.\.Something's wrong with Makocchan\. I need you back here as fast as you can\.  

## 5: Makoto's Strangeness
**Akira:** Sorry for calling you back out of nowhere\. You doing better?  
**Yuuki:** I'm doing just fine\! More importantly, what do you mean, something's wrong with Makoto-nee-sama\!?  
**Yuuki:** She doesn't have to worry about that man anymore, right\!?  
**Akira:** I'm gonna explain, so just take it easy, Yuuki\.  
**Akira:** But first, I gotta check something\. Hirona\.\.\. What the hell're you doing here? Remember Okinawa? What happened there?  
**Hirona:** I'm taking a break right noww\.  
**Akira:** \.\.\.You're always doing this\. Though, I'm honestly glad you're here now\.  
**Hirona:** I'm just glad this works out efficiently\.  
**Akira:** Whatever\.\.\. And? Shidou Maki\. What're you doing here?  
**Maki:** It's my mission\.  
**Maki:** You understand your situation, right? With all that's happening, Hitakami Makoto's most trusted friends decide to meet up?  
**Maki:** Don't be surprised when someone gets assigned to keep an eye on you\.  
**Akira:** \.\.\.I get that much\. Doesn't mean they had to send the top of the damn Special Defense Team\.  
**Maki:** Just consider that to show how high priority you are\.  
**Akira:** Is that right\. But y'know, we really don't have anything to do with that old bastard\.  
**Akira:** That guy\.\.\. he gave us our own share of shit to deal with\.  
**Maki:** Then, will you work together with me?  
**Akira:** \.\.\.Fine\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.If that's settled, can we get back to the conversation\.  
**Hirona:** What happened with Makoto-san?  
**Akira:** \.\.\.She shut herself in her room\. I can't even get her to take a step outside\.  
**Yuuki/Hirona:** \.\.\.  
**Maki:** \.\.\.Is that really that serious?  
**Yuuki:** Nee-sama, who always takes Akira-nee-sama and me to all kinds of places for fun turned into a shut-in\.\.\.  
**Hirona:** Makoto-san, who always works so energetically you can never tell if she's even taking breaks, won't leave her room\.\.\.  
**Akira:** Yeah\. She locked herself in; won't even talk to anybody\. It's seriously messed up\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.When you say anybody, does you mean you too, Akira-sann?  
**Akira:** Yeah, I didn't get to see her either\. But\.\.\. somebody who brought her food said they got to see her for a minute\.\.\.  
**Akira:** They said, it's like she was all spaced out, or lifeless or something\.\.\. Like she was a totally different person\.  
**Hirona:** Makoto-san was usually always smiling\.\.\. But now\.\.\.  
**Yuuki:** Knowing Nee-sama, maybe she has something incredibly important on her mind?  
**Akira:** Still, she's not the type who'd go shutting herself off like that\.  
**Yuuki:** You're right\.\.\. I can never think of her doing anything like this before\.  
**Maki:** This maybe isn't my place to say anything, but\.\.\. Why don't we go take a look at her first?  
**Akira:** I've tried over and over\. But it never works; I always get sent off\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.Ummm\. Can I ask something?  
**Hiyori:** I have a feeling, whatever's making Makoto-san act like that, Genzan-san might have something to do with it\.\.\.  
**Akira:** Huhh? Why'd you think that?  
**Hirona:** When Makoto-san stopped seeing anyone, it was around the time Genzan-san went missing\.\.\. wasn't it?  
**Hirona:** I was thinking, maybe her locking herself in her room is a signal to us\. Like, "Genzan-san is threatening me and forcing me to hide him\."  
**Hirona:** If that's the case, I can understand why she'd go through such a sudden change\.  
**Yuuki:** I don't think Makoto-nee-sama would be threatened by him like that\.\.\.  
**Hirona:** He could be blackmailing her, or using some other method\.\.\. There are all kinds of ways to force someone to do what you tell them\.  
**Yuuki:** Akira-nee-sama\! We have to go save Makoto-nee-sama\!  
**Akira:** If there's a chance that's what's going on, there's no reason for us to be standing out here\.\.\. C'mon with me, Yuuki, Hirona\!  
**Maki:** Wait\.  
**Akira:** What for\!? Don't get in the middle of this\!\!  
**Maki:** Don't start attacking me\. I don't want to stop you\.  
**Maki:** Let me lend a hand\.  
**Maki:** If there's a chance Hitakami Genzan is involved, this is my job too\.  

## 6: Blue Flames (1\)
**Maki:** I put in a call for backup to the bureau\. There's people here watching the place already, but it's not going to be enough\.  
**Akira:** How long's it gonna take for them to get here?  
**Maki:** They have to assemble the unit, then the time it would take to move out\.\.\.  
**Akira:** Fine, I get it\! Basically, it's gonna be a while, right?  
**Akira:** Oi, Hirona\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.We have two options: we can wait for backup to arrive and find out when we can get in touch with Makoto-san\. Or we can break into her room right noww\.  
**Akira:** 'lright, we're busting in\. You're cool with that, right Maki?  
**Maki:** "Swift and decisive should be a soldier's ideal\." I'm ready\.  
**Yuuki:** Just you wait for us, Makoto-nee-sama\!\!  
**Hirona:** (\.\.\.\.\.\.They're all perfectly impulsive, I see\.\)  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.Stop\. Please give me a minute\. I'll talk to the workers and have them step out of the manor\.  
**Akira:** Makocchan\!\!  
**Maki:** You're suspsected of harboring Hitakami Genzan\. You'd better tell us the truth\.  
**Makoto:** \.\.\.Who?  
**Akira:** Makocchan? Oi, Makocchan\! Did that old piece of shit do something to you\!?  
**Yuuki:** Makoto-nee-sama hardly even looks like herself\.\.\. If that man's responsible, he's never getting away with it\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.Akira-san, Yuuki-san\. Right now we should prioritize getting Makoto-san out of here\.  
**Akira:** \.\.\.Good idea\.  
**Akira:** Still don't know if that old bastard's got something to do with this\.\.\. But Makocchan's acting weird for sure\.  
**Akira:** Makocchan, we're getting out of here\. We'll have the bureau keep you safe\.  
**Makoto:** \.\.\.Nay\.  
**Akira:** \.\.\.Uh, Makocchan?  
**Makoto:** \.\.\.\!  
**Akira:** \!?  
**Yuuki:** Uwah\!? A fire\!? We have to put it out\!\!  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.It looked to me like Makoto-san made it\. You saw that, didn't you\.\.\.?  
**Maki:** I saw the same thing\. \.\.\.Is that something to do with tamayori?  
**Akira:** Hell no it's not\! Everybody, get utsushi up\!\! That's not Makocchan\!  
**Yuuki:** What do you mean, Nee-sama\!?  
**Akira:** That freaky looking fire\.\.\. That's Kagutsuchi's fire\!\!  
**Yuuki/Hirona/Maki:** \!?  
**Makoto:** \.\.\.How\!?  
**Akira:** \.\.\.Oh yeah\. You wouldn't remember me, huh\. Back then, I was in tamayori and all\.\.\.  
**Akira:** But I bet if I smack the shit outta you again, you'll remember it this time\!\!  
**Akira:** I don't got a goddamn clue why you're still alive, but\.\.\. You're gonna give us Makocchan back, Kagutsuchiii\!\!  

## 7: Blue Flames (2\)
**Akira:** (\.\.\.What's even goin' on here? If that's Kagutsuchi\.\.\. Why was she just sitting around? Wasn't she supposed to be all about destroying everything?\)  
**Makoto:** \.\.\.\!  
**Akira:** GAH\!\!  
**Maki:** Rrgh\!?  
**Yuuki:** Nee-sama\! Maki-san\!  
**Hirona:** Yuuki-san, look ou--\!?  
**Yuuki:** KYAAAAAAAA\!  
**Everyone:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Makoto:** \.\.\.  
**Suzuka:** \.\.\.That's strange\. I can't reach Maki-san\.  
**Yume:** Ehhh? And she made us come all the way out here too\. What the heck's Maki-onee-san doing?  
**Suzuka:** I'll try calling her one more time\.  
**Yume:** I mean, we haven't even seen anybody around\. Is this really the right place?  
**Suzuka:** It should be\.  
**Suzuka:** \.\.\.She isn't picking up\. Yume, we're searching the interior\.  
**Suzuka:** The rest of you, guard the perimiter\.  
**Toji:** Understood\!  
**Suzuka:** This is the only room left\. Something smells like it's burning\.\.\.\!?  
**Suzuka:** Maki-san\!?  
**Maki:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Yume:** Looks like Maki-onee-san and those other three passed out\.  
**Suzuka:** \.\.\.Yes, they don't seem to be seriously injured\.  
**Yume:** Anyway, I'm gonna go call someone to get them\. They all look pretty heavy\.  
**Suzuka:** Please do\.  
**Suzuka:** And no sign of Hitakami Makoto\.\.\. She couldn't have done all this, could she\.\.\.?  

## 8: A Dream of Lingering Flames
**Mihono:** Ah\.\.\. This is, that one dream\.\.\. Why am I seeing it again\.\.\.?  
**Kanayamahime:** Mihono\.  
**Mihono:** Kanayamahime?  
**Kanayamahime:** Yes\.  
**Mihono:** It's been a while\! \.\.\.Actually, I guess that's weird to say\. Cause you've been with me this whole time\.  
**Mihono:** Are you feeling better now?  
**Kanayamahime:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Kanayamahime?  
**Kanaymahime:** Please beware of Kagutsuchi\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Eh, Kagutsuchi\.\.\.? But, we took care of Kagutsuchi back then, didn't we?  
**Kanayamahime:** Yes, at that time, we did destroy Kagutsuchi\.  
**Kanayamahime:** However\.\.\. Even now, I can clearly feel Kagutsuchi's power\.  
**Kanayamahime:** Please be careful, Mihono\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** But, wait\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** What's that mean, Kanayamahime\!?  
**Mihono:** Ah-- A dream\!\!  
**Mihono:** Or, not\! It was a dream, but that dream\.\.\. It wasn't a dream\!  
**Chie:** Kagutsuchi is still alive\!?  
**Kiyoka:** Didn't you all defeat it, Hono-chan?  
**Mihono:** I thought we did, but\.\.\. Kanayamahime came into my dream and told me\.  
**Kofuki:** Works for me; Kagutsuchi\! I bet that'll give me some fun\!  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.This is more serious than that\.  
**Yui:** What should we do?  
**Mirja:** I'll make an appointment with Origami Akane-sama\.
