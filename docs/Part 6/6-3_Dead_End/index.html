Kill Mihocchi and hand her over!? Is she serious? Kanayamahime&#x27;s the one she wants, right? What the hell&#x27;s she asking for that for?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> It&#x27;s going to be fine, Mihono-chan. There&#x27;s no way we&#x27;re letting Kagutsuchi get you.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Kanami&#x27;s right. Apparently even Origami Yukari made it clear she wouldn&#x27;t when they were negotiating.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> So long as we bring down Kagutsuchi, there&#x27;s nothing to worry about.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Yeah. Thanks, both of you.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> It&#x27;s just...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Just what?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I feel like, from what I know about Kagutsuchi, she wouldn&#x27;t say that. She&#x27;d just come take Kanayamahime herself.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> ...It&#x27;s cause of Genzan. There&#x27;s no way he didn&#x27;t teach Kagutsuchi some of his messed up tricks.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Genzan... san?<br>
<strong>Yuuki:</strong> He&#x27;s an older relative of ours. &quot;Don&#x27;t slay aradama! Aradama are gods!&quot; He&#x27;d tell us that kind of stuff. He was a little weird.<br>
slay</p><p><strong>Kaoru:</strong> It&#x27;s not like we&#x27;ve got any proof you still aren&#x27;t working for that guy.<br>
<strong>Yuuki:</strong> We wouldn&#x27;t lie about that!<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Give it up, Yuuki. Nothing we say&#x27;s gonna convince anybody.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> We&#x27;re just gonna have to show them.<br>
<strong>Yuuki:</strong> Nee-sama...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Come on, Kaoru. Don&#x27;t be mean to them. You really do trust them deep down, don&#x27;t you?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Honestly, it&#x27;s half and half. That Genzan guy, Kagutsuchi killed him, right? I heard nobody put up with him besides his followers.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> ...You got that right.<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> ...Could I bring something up? We were thinking Genzan-san was manipulating Kagutsuchi, but doesn&#x27;t this mean that&#x27;s wrong?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Because she killed him?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I&#x27;m not sure... We don&#x27;t know what kind of aradama Kagutsuchi is, so I can&#x27;t say either way.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> But, I think it&#x27;s clear Kagutsuchi decided Hitakami Genzan wasn&#x27;t necessary anymore.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Hey hey, we don&#x27;t have to talk about this stuff here! With all these strong, pretty toji around, we&#x27;ll take care of Kagutsuchi one way or another!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> ...Right. We&#x27;ll suppress Kagutsuchi and rescue Makoto.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Hang on a minute. I think we should work separately from those three.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Considering the risks posed to Asakura Mihono, that is one way around it.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> However, if it meant losing their support against Kagutsuchi, I can&#x27;t deny it would put us in trouble.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> ...If it makes it any better, just think of me as Mihono&#x27;s meatshield.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Anything that&#x27;d happen to Mihono... I&#x27;ll make sure it won&#x27;t. I owe you that much.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Akira-san...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...If you mean that, then you have to put Hono-chan before anything else. Can you do that?<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> You don&#x27;t even have to tell me.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> (If it came down to it... Even if I had to kill Makocchan myself, I&#x27;d keep you safe.)<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> (I know Makocchan&#x27;d tell me to do the same thing.)  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="2-kagutsuchis-domain"></a>2: Kagutsuchi&#x27;s Domain<a class="hash-link" href="#2-kagutsuchis-domain" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Maki:</strong> It&#x27;s...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I saw the reports on the elevated heat in the area, but... I&#x27;d never expected it to be to this degree.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Even the trees are on fire. There&#x27;s no way we can get in there...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Yomi, do you think you could check things out inside?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I can.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I&#x27;ve located several aradama. I&#x27;d imagine they were created by Kagutsuchi.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> !?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> What&#x27;s wrong?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> My aradama disappeared. I don&#x27;t think they could withstand the heat.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> What should we do now, Maki-san?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ...I want to hear what all of you think.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> In my opinion, our only option is to retreat. We should acquire as much information as possible, of course, but we can&#x27;t do anything more than that.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I think that&#x27;s all we&#x27;ve got too. Even if we wait here, it&#x27;s not like that&#x27;s doing anything.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Plus, it&#x27;s crazy hot here. Can&#x27;t we leave already?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Shidou-san, Konohana-san, Tsubakuro-san, please go on ahead. I&#x27;ll handle the information gathering.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ...We&#x27;re counting on you, Yomi.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Right.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I wanna have ice cream-.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> We&#x27;re on a mission now, Yume.<br>

Choukai... Did you hear?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah, they said it&#x27;d be really tough to send people up there.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Y&#x27;know, I&#x27;ve been thinking a little... Maybe we could get Kagutsuchi to come to an understanding with us?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Like with Kanayamahime, and Kohime-chan... We managed to get along.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> That&#x27;s just like you, Kanami.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> But me... I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s going to work with Kagutsuchi. When I felt Kagutsuchi&#x27;s strength right up close... I could tell, this is different from with Kohime or Kanayamahime.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> But, does it really have to be...?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Though, if we can&#x27;t even make it to her in the first place, there&#x27;s not much point talking about it I guess.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> That&#x27;s for sure.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Is there even anything we could be doing now...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Want to spar or something?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Sorry, I&#x27;m just not feeling like it. I think I&#x27;ll watch some TV.<br>
<strong>Announcer:</strong> Now for our next topic.<br>
<strong>Announcer:</strong> Miss Origami Akane, Director of the Sword Administration Bureau, has announced the abnormal weather conditions at Mt. Choukai are being caused by the great aradama Kagutsuchi.<br>
<strong>Announcer:</strong> Along with an evacuation order, government officials have stated--<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Evacuee:</strong> The sky went all red... It&#x27;s a real calamity. I&#x27;m not sure even even the toji are going to be able to do anything about that.<br>
<strong>Expert A:</strong> If we can&#x27;t send toji to reach Kagutsuchi, there&#x27;s not going to be any way to resolve this situation. Would there be any way for them to come in  from the air?<br>
<strong>Expert B:</strong> That wouldn&#x27;t be easy to pull off. If the heat caused any kind of trouble, the whole crew would be in danger.<br>
<strong>Expert A:</strong> In that case, how about a heat-armored rescue truck?<br>
<strong>Expert B:</strong> No vehicle that could make it is currently in operation.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> How to get toji to reach Kagutsuchi... Can we even really do it.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> We&#x27;ll do it; count on it. Hiyori-chan even told me she got put on a mission to help with that.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> She did?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Yep.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> They&#x27;ll start by getting as close as they can by car. After that, they&#x27;re testing to see if they can reach Kagutsuchi using Storm Armor with a built in heat-resistance.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="4-south-with-north-1"></a>4: South With North (1)<a class="hash-link" href="#4-south-with-north-1" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Starting our test approach with jin&#x27;i.

<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Please do the best you can-!<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> Suu, we have to start getting ready too.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Hokuto-san.<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> What?<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> I&#x27;ve been thinking... Since Juujou-san and Sayaka-san are here, I don&#x27;t need to be here, do I?<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> ...Suu.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> I mean, didn&#x27;t they say it&#x27;s all a bunch of tough aradama in there!<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> So, wouldn&#x27;t it make sense to leave that to Juujou-san and Sayaka-san!? Right!?<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> We&#x27;re not doing that, Suu.<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> Now&#x27;s the time to test every method we can. Juujou-san and Itomi-san are trying jin&#x27;i, and you&#x27;re here to test how close you can get using utsushi.<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> Remember?<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> I remember, but... When I look at this...<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> I know I can use utsushi a lot more than most... but, just because I can use it a lot doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s going to make any difference...<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> Didn&#x27;t you say you would help with the mission so long as I could be with you? That&#x27;s why I was assigned to support you.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> That&#x27;s because... you said this was putting all of Japan in danger... I was scared, but I felt like, if there&#x27;s something I can do to help...<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> I know, and I&#x27;m proud of you for feeling that way. So let&#x27;s do everything we can until we&#x27;re done here, alright?<br>

She says Inami Suu went in.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> But...<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...I know even Suu won&#x27;t be able to get through. It&#x27;s only been a few minutes since we entered Mt. Choukai, and still...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Do you think we&#x27;ll be able to fight in the middle of this?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...We can&#x27;t.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Jin&#x27;i, utsushi, and even the combat gear; it makes you realize none of it was meant for moving long distances.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> And... the heat makes it hard to breathe.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Yeah. Ever since we came up the mountain, it feels like I&#x27;m suffocating.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Sayaka, let&#x27;s take a path back where aradama won&#x27;t find us. We&#x27;ll meet up with Inami Suu on the way.<br>

<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> We&#x27;re testing lots of things in order to suppress Kagutsuchi, but none of them seem promising yet.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Hana-san said they&#x27;re getting sent around doing all kinds of things; it seems really busy.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> She also says there&#x27;s a bunch of hate building up for the Sword Administration Bureau right now too.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You heard from her...? Where did you get to see Hana-san?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Nowhere; I called her! I felt like hearing her voice, so I didn&#x27;t stop calling until she picked up!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> O-Oh, that&#x27;s why...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> We should really do something...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Mmhm, she&#x27;s definitely bothering Hana-san.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah; I didn&#x27;t mean that, I meant with Kagutsuchi.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Like do what? It&#x27;s not like we can even get to Kagutsuchi, so what the hell&#x27;re we supposed to do?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I know, but that&#x27;s not the point! If there&#x27;s a bunch of people not happy with the Bureau, it&#x27;s cause everybody&#x27;s feeling worried, right?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> They must be...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> We know just how hard everyone is working towards this. But, everyday people, they can&#x27;t tell...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re feeling anxious because it looks to them like the Bureau isn&#x27;t doing anything.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Couldn&#x27;t we do something to make them feel just a little bit less worried?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Hmm, I think that might be easier said than done though.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Defeating Kagutsuchi would be the best way... but if we can&#x27;t even get close to her, that&#x27;ll never work.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Worse than not being able to get close, the area affected by Kagutsuchi seems to be growing gradually.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Does that mean Kagutsuchi is getting stronger?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> More than likely.<br>

<strong>Ellen:</strong> Are you all a bunch of muscleheads, Inagon?<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Shut up. This stuff was always Makocchan&#x27;s job.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> If you&#x27;re gonna talk, you better have a plan too.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Sure thing I do-! Let&#x27;s put out our own news story and show how hard we&#x27;re working to clean all this up!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> If that makes those who&#x27;re worried about how things&#x27;ll turn out just a little bit relieved... Everybody&#x27;ll be happy!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> First off, we&#x27;ll need to get permission from the presidents. Then, I&#x27;d like to go take our own photos from up front where everything&#x27;s happening.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Though, it&#x27;s awfully difficult getting pictures of fighting aradama... Hmm, where should we go then?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> You&#x27;re right... It&#x27;s not like we could go do a photoshoot attacking Kagutsuchi anyway either...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...We&#x27;re supposed to stay at school on stadby for beating Kagutsuchi, but I heard it&#x27;s really busy out there. Yui said Hana told her all about it.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> We&#x27;d only need a couple days, so could we go be there?<br>
<strong>Yuuki:</strong> In that case, I want to go lend a hand at the shelters! I&#x27;m sure they could use more help, and they&#x27;re probably worried about whether more aradama will come.<br>

<strong>Akira:</strong> ...Fine. Then, it&#x27;s the four of us.<br>
<strong>Mihono/Yuuki:</strong> OKAY!<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> ......Understoood.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="8-not-as-things-are-1"></a>8: Not as Things Are (1)<a class="hash-link" href="#8-not-as-things-are-1" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Yuuki:</strong> We&#x27;ve arrived!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ooh; I like that look you&#x27;re giving me! I&#x27;ll take it!<br>
<strong>Yuuki:</strong> Uwah!?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Yui, I know you know better. You can&#x27;t startle people by taking their pictures out of nowhere.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ehehe, sorry about that. But, getting scolded by Chie-san is the best!<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> ......Yamashiro-san never changes, does shee.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Yui&#x27;s always going to be Yui.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> ...So, why&#x27;re Yui and Chie here anyway? What&#x27;s the deal, Mihono?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I told them I was going with you to the shelter, and they said they wanted to come too.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Boss! Mai-chan and Ellen-san made me their cameraman!<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Yeah, we&#x27;d probably need one of those. So, what about you?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> It would be better to have a chaperone, wouldn&#x27;t it?<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> (...Hmph, so basically, you don&#x27;t trust us. Well, that figures.)<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> ......What&#x27;s on your mind, Boss?<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> None of your business. And also, don&#x27;t you start calling me &#x27;Boss&#x27;. It just feels like you&#x27;re making fun of me.<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> Fiine.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Alright then, let&#x27;s go in there, guys!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Ah, hang on a minute.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> There&#x27;s one thing I want you to keep in mind... I don&#x27;t think these people are going to be happy to see us.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Yeah, I know.<br>
<strong>Child:</strong> Ah-- The tojis are here!<br>
<strong>Woman:</strong> Oh, they really are. Thank you so much, for all your hard work.<br>
<strong>Yuuki:</strong> H-Huh? I thought they wouldn&#x27;t be happy...?<br>
<strong>Man:</strong> The toji are always helping around the shelter, with guarding it and whatever we need.<br>
<strong>Man:</strong> What would we have to complain about?<br>
<strong>Child:</strong> Um...<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Nn? What&#x27;s up? Want some candy?<br>
<strong>Child:</strong> Were you on TV, Onee-san?<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> !?<br>
<strong>Woman:</strong> Ah, you&#x27;re the tamayori toji, Inago Akira-san, aren&#x27;t you! And you must be Toribane Yuuki-chan!<br>
<strong>Woman:</strong> That&#x27;s amazing! With such famous toji here, you could take care of that great aradama in no time!<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> (After all that showing off we did... sure there&#x27;d be people out there thinking tamayori&#x27;ll take care of it.)<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> (But, we&#x27;re not using tamayori anymore... There&#x27;s no way we can give them what they want...)<br>
<strong>Yuuki:</strong> Nee-sama... Are you doing okay?<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> You got ten billion years to go before you get to be the one worrying about me!<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> ...Yeah, just leave this to us! That great aradama&#x27;ll be gone before you know it!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> We&#x27;re going to go patrol the area now and take care of any aradama! So, everyone, please keep hanging in there!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="9-not-as-things-are-2"></a>9: Not as Things Are (2)<a class="hash-link" href="#9-not-as-things-are-2" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Chie:</strong> ...Mm, you look better now.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Huh? What&#x27;d you mean, better?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> I mean you, Inago-san.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> You were acting a little strange before. I thought maybe getting a breath of fresh air would help.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Why would you...<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Couldn&#x27;t you just leave me alone?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Eh?<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Don&#x27;t play dumb!!<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Those people back there, whose fault you think it is they&#x27;re stuck in some shelter now? That&#x27;s all on us Hitakamis.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> ...So I figured, they&#x27;ll hate us for it, but that&#x27;s what we get. You&#x27;re right, they weren&#x27;t gonna be happy to see us, but I was fine with that!<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Instead, they loved it... Honestly, it made me want to throw up. But hey, what could I do but swallow it down!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Why even bother caring about me?<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> You don&#x27;t even trust me, Chie... do you? Wasn&#x27;t that the whole reason you came here with Mihono?<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> So just go ahead stop giving a damn about whatever happens to us.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> You&#x27;re right. I was worried about Mihono-chan. But, as for whether or not I trust you... Mmm, I can&#x27;t even tell myself.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> I just know that... You&#x27;re all doing everything you can now.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Is it really that strange to want to help someone who&#x27;s trying their hardest?<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> ...You&#x27;re way too soft, every single one of you.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> You think so?<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> Yeah... It&#x27;s pretty cool.<br>
<strong>Akira:</strong> (And that&#x27;s why... Mihono decided she was better off with you than us.)  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="10-the-way-the-wind-blows"></a>10: The Way the Wind Blows<a class="hash-link" href="#10-the-way-the-wind-blows" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Mirja:</strong> It looks like helping with the evacuees went well.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah! We got to talk to so many of them; it was really fun.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> You should come with us next time, Mirja-san!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I&#x27;ll consider it.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> By the way, Hono-chan. Where&#x27;s Yui-chan?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Yui went to go give the pictures she took to Mai. She was taking a whole bunch, so they&#x27;ll probably have a hard time picking which ones.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Knowing Yui-chan... How many pictures did she take that had nothing to do with anything?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah, she took way too many.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> It&#x27;s still nice to have good news for a change.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> But... How&#x27;s everything going with Kagutsuchi?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> ...We haven&#x27;t made any noteworthy progress. Right now, we need to be perfectly ready for when the time comes to fight her.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...It&#x27;s really frustrating not being able to do anything else though.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> (They&#x27;re all trying so hard... But, what can I do...)<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> There&#x27;s so many good shots in here! Thank you, Yui!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> It&#x27;s hard narrowing down which ones to use. Though that&#x27;s a good thing. I&#x27;m glad we asked you, Yui-chan.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ehehe, I get all warm and fuzzy when you praise me.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I tried to take as many pictures and videos as I could... Do you think they&#x27;ll help everybody?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Mmhm, more than I&#x27;d even expected!!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I only planned on using photos at first, bu with this much to work with, it&#x27;d be better if we made a video.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Yes!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> I&#x27;ll do my best editing it together-! Let&#x27;s make a video for everyone to see!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Is there anything else you need help with?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> You&#x27;ve already done so much, Yui-chan.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> That&#x27;s right! Just let us handle the rest!!<br>
<strong>Akane:</strong> Thank you all for making arrangements with the media. With your help, this should greatly reduce the criticism of the Sword Administration Bureau.<br>
<strong>Konohana Family Representative:</strong> Think nothing of it. Footage from your toji came in at just the right time.<br>
<strong>Konohana Family Representative:</strong> Was that your doing, Akane-sama?<br>
<strong>Akane:</strong> That was something the students carried out on their own.<br>
<strong>Mashiko Family Representative:</strong> Seems like you&#x27;re bringing up a capable bunch.<br>
<strong>Akane:</strong> ...I&#x27;m very proud of them all.<br>
<strong>Konohana Family Representative:</strong> Wasn&#x27;t Yanase Mai-san involved in this as well?<br>
<strong>Yanase Family Representative:</strong> She&#x27;s told me she only went as far as preparing the video itself.<br>
<strong>Mashiko Family Representative:</strong> It&#x27;s promising of them to be able to put out something so influential.<br>
<strong>Akane:</strong> (The media should be satisfied with this for the time being. Now if we could only find some way of getting close to Kagutsuchi...)</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations/edit/docs/Part 6/6-3_Dead_End.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_2_ui" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_3DPF"></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/tnm-translations/docs/Part 6/6-2_Live_Fire/"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Â« 6-2 Live Fire</div></a></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"></div></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_35-E thin-scrollbar"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#1-discord" class="table-of-contents__link">1: Discord</a></li><li><a href="#2-kagutsuchis-domain" class="table-of-contents__link">2: Kagutsuchi&#39;s Domain</a></li><li><a href="#3-a-chain-of-concerns" class="table-of-contents__link">3: A Chain of Concerns</a></li><li><a href="#4-south-with-north-1" class="table-of-contents__link">4: South With North (1)</a></li><li><a href="#5-south-with-north-2" class="table-of-contents__link">5: South With North (2)</a></li><li><a href="#6-unstoppable" class="table-of-contents__link">6: Unstoppable</a></li><li><a href="#7-strategy-meeting" class="table-of-contents__link">7: Strategy Meeting</a></li><li><a href="#8-not-as-things-are-1" class="table-of-contents__link">8: Not as Things Are (1)</a></li><li><a href="#9-not-as-things-are-2" class="table-of-contents__link">9: Not as Things Are (2)</a></li><li><a href="#10-the-way-the-wind-blows" class="table-of-contents__link">10: The Way the Wind Blows</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Links</div><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://pastebin.com/LdyviZ8Z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Translator anon&#x27;s pastebin<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Site source code<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Built with Docusaurus.</div></div></div></footer></div>
