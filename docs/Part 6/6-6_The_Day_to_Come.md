6-6 The Day to Come
===================

## 1: Mihono and Kagutsuchi (1)
**Tsugumi:** Then, the operation will commence. I'm starting the countdown-.  
**Mirja:** Investigation team, are you ready?  
**Mihono:** I'm ready whenever!  
**Chie:** No issues here.  
**Kofuki:** Let's just do this already.  
**Kiyoka:** I-I'm starting to get nervous.  
**Yui:** Don't worry, I'll be right with you, Kiyoka-chan!  
**Mirja:** ...It doesn't seem there's any problems. What about you three, Satsuki Yomi, Inago Akira, Nitta Hirona?  
**Yomi:** I'm ready.  
**Akira:** All good here too.  
**Hirona:** Riiight, I'm readyy.  
**Mirja:** All members report no issues. Please begin the countdown.  
**Tsugumi:** I'll start then. Three, two, one...  
**Tsugumi:** Launch.  
**Tsugumi:** ...Please make it back safe.  
**Chie:** Is everyone okay!?  
**Mirja:** Everyone seems to have landed safely!  
**Kiyoka:** Look out, Mirja-san!  
**Kiyoka:** YAHH!!  
**Mirja:** Thank you, Musumi Kiyoka!  
**Kagutsuchi:** ...  
**Mihono:** That's...  
**Kagutsuchi:** ...Kanaymahime...  
**Mihono:** --!? Kanayamahime? She's reacting to Kagutsuchi...!?  
**Mihono:** This is...  
**Kagutsuchi:** ...Give her back...!  
**Mihono:** Listen to me, Kagutsuchi! We didn't come here to fight you!  
**Kagutsuchi:** ...Give her back...  
**Akira:** ORAH!  
**Akira:** What now, Mihono! Kagutsuchi's not about to start letting us talk!  
**Kagutsuchi:** ...Kanayamahime... Give her back.  
**Mihono:** Kagutsuchi...  
**Kofuki:** Quit just standing there, Mihocchi!  
**Kofuki:** Let's show her a good time first! Otherwise we're never getting this talk started!  
**Mihono:** Talking with our swords... That's the Kanami way of doing things.  
**Kofuki:** Am I supposed to care!  
**Mihono:** Still... Yeah. Here I come, Kagutsuchi!!  
**Mihono:** Tell me how you're feeling!!  

## 2: Mihono and Kagutsuchi (2)
**Mihono:** ...I guess I can't really do it like Kanami can.  
**Mihono:** But... I can tell from where you're looking and how you're moving, you're scared of us.  
**Mihono:** Can't we just stop this?  
**Kagutsuchi:** ...  
**Yui:** She ran off!?  
**Mirja:** What's she after?  
**Yui:** Maybe she thought she couldn't beat Mihono-chan...?  
**Kiyoka:** I don't think she can fix that by running though...  
**Kofuki:** Besides that, it's friggin' hot... Let's just get after her.  
**Chie:** ...The heat?  
**Yomi:** ...The surrounding temperature is rising.  
**Akira:** Oh yeah!? That jackass Kagutsuchi's tryin' to boil us alive!!  
**Makoto:** Please listen to me, Kagutsuchi! Akira-chan and the others only want to talk!!  
**Kagutsuchi:** ...No.  
**Makoto:** The toji aren't going to exorcise you!  
**Kagutsuchi:** ...No.  
**Makoto:** If you keep doing this, Akira-chan will die... Please... Stop this, Kagutsuchi!!  

## 3: Time Limit
**Yui:** [pant pant].... Nngh, this's rough!  
**Mirja:** Don't lose speed! If you get too far from Kagutsuchi, you'll be engulfed in the heat!  
**Aradama:** GYAOOOOO!  
**Kofuki:** Shit! If we weren't in this oven, I could get all the aradama-chan I wanted!  
**Kofuki:** Sorry, aradama-chan! I'll play with you next time! So outta the way!!  
**Chie:** I don't know how long we can keep running like this... This could be bad if we don't reach Kagutsuchi soon.  
**Kiyoka:** There's even more aradama coming after us too...  
**Kofuki:** Tch, they're bringin' out all the cheap tricks.  
**Chie:** What should we do, Mirja? At this rate...  
**Mirja:** I do have a plan, but...  
**Akira:** Just say it! No matter how bad it is, we gotta do something here!!  
**Mirja:** ...  
**Mirja:** We need to ensure Mihono reaches Kagutsuchi untouched by the aradama.  
**Mihono:** Eh!?  
**Mirja:** Whether we exorcise her or persuade her... Asakura Mihono is the only one who can stand a chance.  
**Akira:** The hell, what's so bad about that! I'm in!  
**Mihono:** H-Hang on a minute!  
**Mihono:** If I mess up... You're all going to die!? Are you really okay with that!?  
**Akira:** Then just don't screw up then.  
**Akira:** I mean, we came here on a one way ride in the first place. We all put our lives on the line.  
**Akira:** I'm bettin' my life on you. ...Take care of Makocchan for me.  
**Hirona:** ......I guess that's all there is to it.  
**Mihono:** Hirona!?  
**Yomi:** Then, Akira, Nitta-san, and I will take the rear.  
**Mihono:** Even Satsuki-san...  
**Yomi:** I think this strategy has the highest chance of success.  
**Yomi:** We have the ceremonial attire too. We shouldn't succumb to the heat that quickly.  
**Akira:** So that's that. Let's go.  
**Mirja:** ...We're countin on you!  
**Akira:** You guys are real dumbasses, goin' out of your way to draw the short straw. This's the most likely place to 
die, y'know?  
**Yomi:** Did you come here planning to die, Akira? In that case, feel free to die on your own.  
**Yomi:** I'll be returning alive.  
**Akira:** Who said anything about tryin' to die? I'm makin' it outta here, and I'm bringing Makocchan with me!  
**Hirona:** ......  
**Hiyori:** You two sure get alongg.  
**Akira/Yomi:** Hell no we don't!/We're just normal.  
**Akira:** ...Don't go makin' me shout. It's hard enough keepin' breathing as it is.  
**Yomi:** They're here.  
**Akira:** Bring it on! I'm countin' on both of you, so don't go dyin' on me!!  

## 4: Because it's You
**Mihono:** Why are they doing this... Couldn't we have talked something better out!!  
**Kofuki:** This's the problem with you, Ahocchi. You think we got time for that?  
**Mihono:** But...  
**Kiyoka:** You were the one who said we should talk to Kagutsuchi first, Hono-chan. So you'd better take responsibility
 and talk.  
**Mirja:** Asakura Mihono. Just do as you wish.  
**Yui:** After we finish up here, we can all hop in the bath, Mihono-chan!  
**Mihono:** Fukki, Kiyoka, Mirja-san, Yui...  
**Chie:** Mihono-chan.  
**Mihono:** Chii-nee...  
**Chie:** You get the big role.  
**Mihono:** ...Okay.  
**Chie:** ...Mihono-chan. If it were anyone else, even if they had Kanayamahime with them, I would never stake my life 
for them. Only for you.  
**Mihono:** Eh?  
**Chie:** After all the worrying and suffering you've been through... after how hard you worked to get here, I know 
you'll do it, Mihono-chan.  
**Chie:** I'm sure we all feel the same.  
**Mihono:** ...Yeah.  
**Mihono:**  I'll do it, Chii-nee. I'll talk Kagutsuchi out of it no matter what!  
**Kofuki:** Look at Chichie, tryin' to act all cool for her.  
**Chie:** I-I wasn't trying to act cool...  
**Yui:** No way, she was super precious!  
**Mihono:** Yeah, I actually felt a little embarrassed too.  
**Chie:** Mihono-chan!?  
**Mirja:** We can't afford any more chit chat. Thanks to our rear guard, there are less aradama attacking.  
**Mirja:** ...Asakura Mihono. Don't think about anything; just race to Kagutsuchi!  
**Mirja:** We'll keep your way clear!  
**Mihono:** Okay!!  
**Kiyoka:** I wonder if Hono-chan made it to Kagutsuchi...  
**Chie:** I'm sure Mihono-chan will be fine.  
**Kofuki:** This sucks... It's like fighting in a damn sauna.  
**Yui:** Haha, I want us all in a bath when we get back, but a sauna could work too...  
**Mirja:** ...Live so we can make it back! Endure it until Asakura Mihono persuades Kagutsuchi, Investigation team!  

## 5: Three Intents
**Mihono:** I made it, Kagutsuchi!  
**Kagutsuchi:** ...  
**Mihono:** Don't be scared... I just came so we could talk, okay!  
**Kagutsuchi:** ...No.  
**Mihono:** Kgh!  
**Mihono:** Please, just stop, Kagutsuchi! Just cause I'm a toji doesn't mean I want to hurt aradama!  
**Mihono:** I know we can talk to each other!!  
**Kagutsuchi:** ...No!  
**Mihono:** Kagutsuchi!!  
**Mihono:** It's no good; she's not listening... What do I do? Every second I take, everyone's...  
**Mihono:** (Do I kill her...? No; I can't do that!)  
**Mihono:** Killing a scared aradama's definitely the wrong thing to do!  
**Mihono:** Ngh, huh, my chest feels hot... Is that... you, Kanayamahime?  
**Kanayamahime:** Please leave the rest to me, Mihono.  
**Mihono:** Kanayamahime?  
**Kanayamahime:** The aradama, Kagutsuchi, was fearful from the beginning.  
**Mihono:** She was?  
**Kanayamahime:** Do you not believe me?  
**Mihono:** ...No, I do. Seeing Kagutsuchi now... I get it.  
**Mihono:** She's kinda like... a scared kitty.  
**Kanayamahime:** ...Inside of Kagutsuchi, three intents resided.  
**Kanayamahime:** There was I, who sought to understand and if possible form friendly relations with toji to overcome 
that fear of toji.  
**Kanayamahime:** There was the intent to destroy all toji that would threaten it.  
**Mihono:** That's the Kagutsuchi who took me over, right...  
**Kanayamahime:** Yes.  
**Kanayamahime:** And the last remaining... The intent to reject and avoid all connection to toji.  
**Mihono:** To reject everyone...  
**Kanayamahime:** It has no intention of communicating with toji. It will reject everyone and everything toji, seeking 
the farthest from mutual understanding.  
**Mihono:** ...Then what're we supposed to do? Use your power to exorcise it?  
**Mihono:** I don't want to do that!  
**Kanayamahime:** Please leave it to me.  
**Kanayamahime:** I want to understand and form friendly relations with toji. It falls to me to convince that 
Kagutsuchi.  
**Mihono:** ...Alright, Kanayamahime. What should I do?  
**Kanayamahime:** Please touch Kagutsuchi.  
**Mihono:** I just have to touch her...? Okay, here goes, Kagutsuchi!!  
**Kagutsuchi:** !!  

## 6: The Fearful and Timid Aradama
**Kagutsuchi:** Kanayamahime... Become one with me...  
**Kanayamahime:** Yes. Let's return to one. I will offer everything to you.  
**Kanayamahime:** And then... please come to know. All the things I have seen alongside Mihono...  
**Kagutsuchi:** ...!?  
**Kanayamahime:** These girls are an answer. They are the potential for humanity and aradama to coexist.  
**Kagutsuchi:** This is...  
**Kanayamahime:** It is another possibility. The form of coexistence that is being fostered at this very moment.  
**Kagutsuchi:** Kanayamahime...  
**Kanayamahime:** Yes.  
**Kanayamahime:** These are... My memories together with Mihono. My very precious memories...  
**Kanayamahime:** Please look on and see, Kagutsuchi. This is the toji I have watched over for so very long.  
**Kagutsuchi:** ...  
**Kanayamahime:** Do you fear toji?  
**Kagutsuchi:** ...I do...  
**Kanayamahime:** I have learned. Toji are not something only to be feared.  
**Kanayamahime:** That is what Mihono has taught me.  
**Kagutsuchi:** ...No. I cannot...  
**Kanayamahime:** It can happen. In five hundred years I am certain.  
**Kagutsuchi:** ?  
**Kanayamahime:** It is the time I have spent with the Atago.  
**Kagutsuchi:** ...  
**Kanayamahime:** I have spent that much time myself. So you can take that same amount of time.  
**Kanayamahime:** And then, one day...  

## 7: Mihono and Kanayamahime
**Kanayamahime:** ...  
**Mihono:** Kanayamahime...?  
**Kanayamahime:** Yes, Mihono.  
**Mihono:** What happened with Kagutsuchi?  
**Kanayamahime:** She is within me.  
**Mihono:** So she didn't just go away.  
**Kanayamahime:** Yes.  
**Mihono:** Wait, hang on! What about everybody else!? We have to go save them!  
**Kanayamahime:** Please calm down, Mihono. None of their lives are in any danger.  
**Mihono:** Thank goodness! So then... then this can finally all go back to normal!  
**Kanayamahime:** Mihono.  
**Mihono:** First off, you've gotta meet Kohime! I bet you'll be really good friends!  
**Kanayamahime:** Mihono.  
**Mihono:** Hm? What?  
**Kanayamahime:** I will be going to the netherworld with Kagutsuchi.  
**Mihono:** ...Huh?  
**Mihono:** W-Wait, but why!? Kagutsuchi's not dangerous anymore, right!? So, just stay with me!  
**Kanayamahime:** Kagutsuchi's urges have not subsided. Even now, Kagutsuchi fears you.  
**Mihono:** ...  
**Kanayamahime:** One day, when Kagutsuchi's fear has gone... On that day, I will come for you again.  
**Mihono:** ...That's no fair. When you tell me that, I can't just say no.  
**Kanayamahime:** Thank you, Mihono.  
**Mihono:** I'll get to see you again, right?  
**Kanayamahime:** ...One day, I promise.  
**Mihono:** ...Okay. Then, I'll see you again someday, Kanayamahime!!  
**Kanayamahime:** Yes.  
**Kanayamahime:** Goodbye, Mihono.  

## 8: Visitation
**Mihono:** Hello-!  
**Makoto:** Come on in, Asakura-san.  
**Akira:** Yo, Mihono. You came to see how she's doing?  
**Yuuki:** Hi, Mihono-san.  
**Hirona:** Hellooo.  
**Mihono:** Good, you're all here!  
**Mihono:** I got you a gift: a cake Ellen-san told me about! We should all have it together!  
**Makoto:** Thank you, Asakura-san.  
**Makoto:** If Kohagura-san recommended it, it must be delicious. Aren't you lucky, Akira-chan.  
**Akira:** Oi, Makocchan!? Not in front of Mihono!!  
**Mihono:** What do you mean?  
**Yuuki:** You probably didn't know, but Akira-nee-sama loves cakes.  
**Mihono:** Ehh!? Really, Akira-san!? I always thought you were into senbei or something!!  
**Akira:** Why!? I mean, I don't hate 'em, but... Well so what!? I like cake, okay!!  
**Makoto:** Fufu.  
**Mihono:** So that's what you're like when you're with Hitakami-san and them, Akira-san...  
**Hirona:** You have no idea; she's pretty much always like this.  
**Mihono:** Hmm~.  
**Akira:** What! Quit smilin' at me like that!  
**Mihono:** Anybody'd be smiling hearing them talk about you!  
**Akira:** Then we're talkin' about something else now!  
**Mihono:** That's tyranny!  
**Mihono:** Umm, uhh... Then, what were you talking about before I got here?  
**Makoto:** ...  
**Makoto:** It was about tamayori toji. We were told the Sword Administration Bureau has started their re-inspection of 
it, along with looking into the side-effects.  
**Mihono:** ...Yeah, I heard. They want me to help where I can too.  
**Makoto:** ...I'm sorry, Asakura-san. Because of what we did... you were forced through so many terrible experiences...  
**Makoto:** And also... Thank you, for saving Kagutsuchi.  
**Mihono:** You were with Kagutsuchi the whole time, weren't you, Hitakami-san?  
**Makoto:** I was.  
**Makoto:** Though...  it isn't as if I could understand all of what Kagutsuchi was thinking either.  
**Makoto:** Even still... I could always feel how afraid she was of toji. Because of that... I started strongly hoping 
Kagutsuchi would be saved from it...  
**Makoto:** I couldn't bring myself to hate or want her destroyed anymore.  
**Mihono:** I'm sure it'll happen eventually.  
**Mihono:** Eh?  
**Mihono:** I'm sure someday Kagutsuchi won't be scared of toji anymore. After all, Kanayamahime's with her!  
**Makoto:** ...You're right.  
**Makoto:** Before that day comes, we have so much to do.  
**Mihono:** What are you doing?  
**Akira:** We're joining in the inspection of tamayori toji. We gotta do all we can for the ones who're victims of it, 
y'know?  
**Yuuki:** And there's no tamayori toji besides Onee-sama and I, after all!  
**Hirona:** ...I'll do what I can to help too.  
**Hirona:** I can't keep letting it be just Akira-san and Yuuki-san while Akira-san gets all full of herself about it.  
**Akira:** I'm not gettin' full of myself!  
**Mihono:** Ahahaha!  
**Mihono:** (I thought Hitakami-san was a scarier kind of person... I guess she's more like this.)  
**Mihono:** (I get the feeling we could all get along!)  

## 9: Admiration
**Aradama:** OOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!  
**Kofuki:** C'mon! I love you, aradama-chan!!  
**Mirja:** We've finished suppressing the aradama.  
**Mirja:** Even here, there's still no sign of aradama affected by Kagutsuchi.  
**Mihono:** I told you, everything's fine now! Kanayamahime talked Kagutsuchi out of it!  
**Chie:** It's not like we're doubting you, Mihono-chan. But still, we have to do our investigation.  
**Mihono:** I guess, but...  
**Chie:** Though, our investigation is done for now, so do you want to check back at the shelter?  
**Mihono:** Ah, sure! Let's go! I wonder how everyone's doing.  
**Kofuki:** Ugh, I'll pass! It's a waste of time.  
**Kofuki:** Oi, you listening? Tell me where some aradama-chan is around here!  
**Tsugumi:** You just can't work in a group, can you Shichinosato-san.  
**Tsugumi:** I'll keep an eye on Shichinosato-san, so the rest of you go on ahead to the shelter.  
**Kid A:** The tojis are back!  
**Kid B:** Thank you for beating the aradama!  
**Kid C:** Did you fight aradama too, onee-sans?  
**Yui:** Fu fu fu, would you believe it? Mihono-onee-san here beat Kagutsuchi herself!  
**Mihono:** Yui!?  
**Kid A:** Wowww!  
**Kid B:** Did you really?  
**Kiyoka:** She sure did. Hono-chan's an amazing toji.  
**Mihono:** You too, Kiyoka~!?  
**Kid C:** ......Um!  
**Kiyoka:** Mmhm, what is it?  
**Kid C:** I'm learning swordfighting! When I grow up, I want to be a toji too!  
**Yui:** Ohh, that's awesome! You're our kouhai then-!  
**Kid C:** Do you think I can be one?  
**Mihono:** Yeah, if you keep on trying, you'll definitely be one! Where there's a will, there's a way!  
**Kid C:** Where there's a will, there's a way... Thank you very much!!  
**Kid C:** Ah-- Could I show you my swordfighting?  
**Kiyoka:** Sure, go ahead.  
**Yui:** Wow, you're so good! You've got the hang of it!  
**Kid C:** You think so!?  
**Mihono:** (I wonder if I was just like her a few years ago.)  
**Mihono:** Fufu.  
**Kiyoka:** What are you laughing about, Hono-chan?  
**Mihono:** Oh, it's nothing!  
**Mihono:** We'd better keep doing our best so she never stops looking up to us, huh! Kiyoka, Yui!  

## 10: The Day to Come
**Teacher:** That's all for today's supplementary lessons. Be sure to review what you've learned.  
**Mihono/Kanami:** Okaaayyy...  
**Mihono:** Uugh, my head won't stop spinning...  
**Kanami:** Just when I thought the stuff with Kagutsuchi was calming down, makeup classes came back and made everything
 hard again...  
**Mihono:** Mmm... I hate studying...  
**Mihono:** Oh yeah, actually, what were you doing when we were fighting Kagutsuchi, Kanami?  
**Kanami:** I was on aradama suppression missions. They were sending me all over Japan; it was rough...  
**Kanami:** How'd it go for you, Mihono-chan?  
**Mihono:** I guess I realized, there's all kinds of different aradama, aren't there.  
**Kanami:** ...Huh?  
**Mihono:** I don't really know how to put it... Kagutsuchi had three different things she wanted.  
**Mihono:** See, there was Kanayamahime, who saved me, right?  
**Mihono:** And there was the scary Kagutsuchi you fought.  
**Mihono:** And then there was the scared Kagutsuchi that possessed Hitakami-san.  
**Mihono:** Aradama are weird, aren't they.  
**Kanami:** ...I know what you mean. It was the same with Tagitsuhime.  
**Mihono:** I made a promise with Kanayamahime. That, when Kagutsuchi stops being scared of toji, we'll see each other 
again.  
**Mihono:** But I mean, it took her 500 years to understand toji.  
**Mihono:** That's five hundred whole years. I can't live that long...  
**Kanami:** I hope Kagutsuchi starts to understand toji like Kanayamahime did.  
**Mihono:** Yeah!  
**Mihono:** If Kagutsuchi turned out like Nene or Kohime, we'd have even more aradama friends!  
**Kanami:** ...Mihono-chan, you're a genius.  
**Mihono:** Eh?  
**Kanami:** If more people could think like you do, we could get along a lot better with aradama!  
**Mihono:** Y-You think so?  
**Mihono:** Everybody in the investigation team calls me Ahocchi and stuff all the time though...  
**Mihono:** But maybe I was really smart all along!?  
**Kanami:** Yeah, you're smart, Mihono-chan!  
**Kanami:** Let's keep going for it together! And then we'll make a bunch more aradama friends!  
**Mihono:** That sounds good! We should make it a contest to see who can make the most aradama friends!  
**Kanami:** You're on!  
**Mihono:** Mmnn!  
**Mihono:** I used my brain too much, so now I feel like moving my body. Kanami, wanna spar with me right now?  
**Kanami:** You took the words out of my mouth!  
**Mihono:** Okayyy, today's the day I win a match with you!
