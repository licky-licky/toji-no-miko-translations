## 1: Two Okatana (1)
**Academy Intercom:** Academy Intercom: Aradama have been sighted in the area of this academy. Toji, please prepare to 
sortie at once. I repeat, aradama have been sighted--  
**Mirja:** On hand, we have Asakura Mihono, Musumi Kiyoka, and Shichinosato Kofuki.  
**Kofuki:** Hell yeah! Less of us around means I can take 'em all! Don't go anywhere, aradama-chan!  
**Mirja:** You know I won't allow that!  
**Yuuki:** Wait, before you go! Please let the both of us come help!  
**Hirona:** ......If you'll let uss.  
**Kofuki:** Huhh!? Who needs them! Right, Mirja!?  
**Mirja:** The extra hands would be appreciated, but... You won't be using tamayori, understood?  
**Yuuki:** I know that!  
**Yuuki:** And Akira-nee-sama's not here either... but still, I want to fight!  
**Mirja:** ...You'll be operating under my command; I trust that won't be an issue either?  
**Yuuki:** Of course!  
**Mirja:** Very well then. Prepare yourselves as quickly as you can.  
**Mirja:** As soon as they're done, we move out!  
**Kiyoka:** YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!  
**Aradama:** OOOOOOOOOOOOOO!  
**Kiyoka:** Ghh!?  
**Mirja:** What's the matter, Musumi Kiyoka! Your swings are losing focus!  
**Kiyoka:** I-I can handle this!  
**Kofuki:** Hey, if you don't want it, go ahead and give 'em to me! Let's go, aradama-chan!  
**Kofuki:** I've been real stressed out lately! So show me some fun here!!  

## 2: Two Okatana (2)
**Kiyoka:** [pant pant]...  
**Kiyoka:** Eh?  
**Kiyoka:** Nitta-san...  
**Hirona:** ......Did you get hurt? I don't think I've seen you spacing out like that before, Musumi-san.  
**Hirona:** Your swordfighting used to be a lot sharper. You're acting so inefficient today.  
**Kiyoka:** ...Was I really moving that badly?  
**Hirona:** You were. Did something happen?  
**Kiyoka:** ......  
**Hirona:** That okatana... it's different from your normal one, isn't it.  
**Hirona:** ...Why did you bring two okatana?  
**Kiyoka:** This is Koryuu Kagemitsu... It was my first okatana.  
**Kiyoka:** I got permission to bring it out with me.  
**Hirona:** ...Can I ask why?  
**Kiyoka:** I guess... to do whatever I can.  
**Kiyoka:** I used to be so scared of fighting, all I ever did was run away... I was so pathetic that Koryuu Kagemitsu 
gave up on me.  
**Hirona:** So you want to make it approve of you again?  
**Kiyoka:** ...Yeah.  
**Hirona:** ......I don't want to sound rude, but even if you can use that okatana again, it doesn't guarantee you'll be
 stronger.  
**Kiyoka:** Mm, I know that. You're exactly right.  
**Kiyoka:** But still... Even if you're right...  
**Kiyoka:** This is something that means a lot to me.  

## 3: Arm in Arm (1)
**Kiyoka:** This is something that means a lot to me.  
**Hirona:** ...Alright thenn. I know some things are worth doing.  
**Hirona:** So, I'll help you a little.  
**Kiyoka:** Eh?  
**Hirona:** Yuuki-san.  
**Yuuki:** What is it, Hirona-san?  
**Hirona:** It seems like Musumi-san wants to try something, so could we back her up?  
**Yuuki:** Got it!  
**Kiyoka:** ...Would that be okay?  
**Kiyoka:** Toribane-san, we...  
**Yuuki:** We haven't spoken all that much, have we? But that doesn't bother me!  
**Kiyoka:** (It's not that we haven't talked much, it's that I was avoiding you...)  
**Yuuki:** Ah, but, I heard you're very strong, Kiyoka-san! I'd be glad if you'll spar with me after we're done!  
**Kiyoka:** ......  
**Kiyoka:** Toribane-san...  
**Yuuki:** Hm?  
**Kiyoka:** That straightforwardness... It kind of reminds me of Hono-chan.  
**Yuuki:** You mean it? I'm happy you think so!  
**Kiyoka:** ...Nitta-san, Toribane-san! Please give me support!  
**Hirona/Yuuki:** Understoood./Leave it to me!  

## 4: Arm in Arm (2)
**Kofuki:** What, c'mon, is that all you got! Let's keep the fun going, aradama-chan!  
**Aradama:** GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!  
**Kofuki:** Whoa!? Th-This one's shooting fire!?  
**Mirja:** !? Back down, Shichinosato Kofuki! Asakura Mihono! Clear the aradama for Shichinosato Kofuki's retreat!  
**Mihono:** Okay!  
**Kofuki:** We're really playing with fire now, huh!  
**Mihono:** Fukki! Quit saying stupid stuff and get back here!  
**Kofuki:** Sh-Shut up!  
**Kiyoka:** A fire breathing aradama...  
**Hirona:** It's probably an aradama Kagtsuchi made.  
**Yuuki:** One of Kagutsuchi's aradama made it this far...  
**Mirja:** Nitta Hirona, Toribane Yuuki.  
**Mirja:** The both of you have fought with Kagutsuchi, haven't you. What were her flames like compared to this?  
**Yuuki:** Kagutsuchi's flames were a lot hotter.  
**Mirja:** That's perfect then!  
**Mirja:** If we can't manage these flames, we can't fight against Kagutsuchi!  
**Mirja:** We can't allow an aradama like this to give us a struggle! BRING IT DOWN, INVESTIGATION TEAM!  

## 5: Koryuu Kagemitsu (1)
**Aradama:** GYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!  
**Mihono:** HAAHH!  
**Mihono:** Alright! I think I'm getting the hang of it!  
**Mihono:** Fukki!!  
**Kofuki:** I'm all over it!  
**Aradama:** OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!  
**Kofuki:** Tch! That's so annoying!  
**Mirja:** ...They're growing used to dealing with the flames, though their offense is lacking.  
**Kiyoka:** ......  
**Mirja:** (Musumi Kiyoka's movements are off key... It looks as if she wants to try something.)  
**Mirja:** (I suppose I'll let her keep at it a little longer.)  
**Kiyoka:** (Koryuu Kagemitsu... Why aren't you responding...?)  
**Kiyoka:** (I can't keep being a burden on the others... Maybe I should just give up while I can...)  
**Mihono:** I'm getting the hang of what it's gonna do... Fukki, you give it another shot!  
**Kofuki:** Sure thing! I'll do this as many times as you want!  
**Kiyoka:** ...  
**Kiyoka:** (No, I can't give up on this! Hono-chan and Kofuki-san aren't giving up either!)  
**Kiyoka:** (If I'm acting this weak, I'm no better than I used to be! Koryuu Kagemitsu would be sickened by me!)  
**Kiyoka:** See who I am now, Koryuu Kagemitsu!  
**Kiyoka:** YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHH!!  

## 6: Koryuu Kagemitsu (2)
**Yuuki:** [pant pant]...  
**Kiyoka:** Are you okay, Toribane-san?  
**Yuuki:** You shouldn't worry about me...! Compared to training with Akira-nee-sama, this is...  
**Aradama:** GYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!  
**Yuuki:** --!?  
**Hirona:** Yuuki-san!?  
**Yuuki:** ...  
**Hirona:** Yuuki-san! Get back up, Yuuki-san!!  
**Kiyoka:** (I'm scared...)  
**Mihono:** Yuuki!  
**Mirja:** Move to cover for Toribane Yuuki! Musumi Kiyoka--  
**Kiyoka:** (I'm scared... Koryuu Kagemitsu...)  
**Mirja:** (...It's no use!)  
**Mirja:** Asakura Mihono! Shichinosato Kofuki! Cut the aradama off!!  
**Kofuki/Mihono:** On it!/Right!  
**Kiyoka:** (I'm scared of my friends getting hurt... I'm scared of not being able to protect them...)  
**Kiyoka:** If it has to be one or the other...  
**Kiyoka:** I'm not scared of fighting at all! MIRJA-SAN!  
**Mirja:** --!? What is it!  
**Kiyoka:** Watch after Toribane-san! I'll stop the aradama...!  
**Mirja:** ...Understood; I'm leaving it to you!  
**Kiyoka:** RIGHT!  
**Kiyoka:** (I had fun swordfighting, but actually doing it scared me.)  
**Kiyoka:** (I was so afraid of getting hurt. Of having tooth and nail and blade pointed at me.)  
**Kiyoka:** (I hated anything scary or painful.)  
**Kiyoka:** (I didn't want to get hurt, I didn't want to die out on some mission.)  
**Kiyoka:** (But... Now I know, there's something that hurts more... something that scares me even more than that!)  
**Kiyoka:** (I hate having to fight!)  
**Kiyoka:** (I really hate hurting anybody, or getting hurt!)  
**Kiyoka:** (But still...!)  
**Kiyoka:** (Being useless... Not being able to do anything for my friends, that hurts the most; I HATE THAT THE MOST!)  
**Kiyoka:** THAT'S WHY!  
**Kiyoka:** This aradama... It's nothing to Koryuu Kagemitsu and I!  
**Aradama:** oooo...  
**Kiyoka:** I did it... I did it, Koryuu Kagemitsu!  
**Kofuki:** You're using two swords now...? C'mon, what're you, copying me?  
**Mihono:** Kiyoka! You looked super cool back there!!  
**Kiyoka:** It's all thanks to you, Hono-chan!  
**Mihono:** Ehhh!? But, I didn't do anything!?  
**Kiyoka:** That's not true. You're the one who taught me something so important, Hono-chan!  
**Kiyoka:** (Hono-chan has been through so much worse... She was crying so hard, and all I could do was watch...)  
**Kiyoka:** (Being like that is what I hate more than anything.)  
**Mirja:** I had a feeling you were trying something... You had Koryuu Kagemitsu? Well done, Musumi Kiyoka.  
**Kiyoka:** Thanks a lot. But, is Yuuki-san okay...?  
**Hirona:** She's only lost consciousness. ...Musumi-san, thank you.  
**Kiyoka:** ...! Don't mention it!  

## 7: Mihono's Worries
**Yuuki:** Kiyoka-san, congratulations! I wish I could have seen you using Koryuu Kagemitsu too.  
**Kiyoka:** ...I could only do it because of you, Toribane-san. Because you were trying your best...  
**Kiyoka:** Since everyone was working so hard, I felt like I had to do the best I could too.  
**Yuuki:** It wasn't like that! It's just, the most I can do is put myself on the line!  
**Hirona:** ...It was very bad for my heart.  
**Hirona:** I mean it.  
**Kofuki:** Never thought I'd hear you shouting like that.  
**Hirona:** Was I that loud?  
**Akira:** ......  
**Yuuki:** What's the matter, Akira-nee-sama?  
**Akira:** What am I even good for... I was saying I'd keep Mihono safe, but wasn't even there when it mattered... How 
goddamn lame is that...  
**Yuuki:** It's not your fault; the mission suddenly came up. Didn't it, Mihono-san?  
**Mihono:** ...  
**Yuuki:** Mihono-san?  
**Mihono:** Huh? Ah, y-yeah. She's right. And anyway, we got to see Kiyoka being really cool too!  
**Mihono:** You were awesome, Kiyoka!  
**Kiyoka:** Th-That's enough, Hono-chan!!  
**Akira:** ......  
**Akira:** (Mihono... She's got something bothering her? Don't tell me...)  
**Akira:** Sorry for calling you out here.  
**Ellen:** We don't mind! Don't we, Kaoru?  
**Kaoru:** Yeah, don't worry about it. You probably don't have that many friends to turn to after all-.  
**Akira:** Dumbass, it's not like that. I've got plenty back home I could talk to if I wanted.  
**Akira:** But this; you're about the only people I could think of I can tell about it.  
**Ellen:** Oh, is this about something serious?  
**Akira:** ...Mihono's acting weird.  
**Kaoru:** Isn't that the best part about her?  
**Ellen:** For sure. Being funny and cute is Mihomiho's appeal!  
**Akira:** Is that really all you two think of Mihono...?  
**Kaoru:** We're just kidding.  
**Akira:** ...I'm trying to be serious here; could you cut it out?  
**Akira:** On that mission before, you heard Yuuki got hurt, right? When we went to see her in the hospital, something 
was wrong about how Mihono was acting.  
**Akira:** Like something was tearing her up, like something's on her mind...  
**Akira:** I saw people get that look before. The girls who volunteered for tamayori... they all looked like that.  
**Kaoru:** ...You're saying Mihono'd try and sacrifice herself?  
**Ellen:** Mihomiho has a big heart, after all...  
**Ellen:** Back when she was put in confinement too... apparently she said she was okay with it if it'd fix everything.  
**Akira:** But nobody wants to fix anything if that's what it takes...  
**Kaoru:** I thought that's just what they teach you at Minoseki. I mean, didn't you do the exact same thing?  
**Akira:** Me? ...? No way, I've never done anything like that.  
**Ellen:** What are you talking about? You're the one who became a tamayori toji when you knew all about the risks. And 
there were side-effects, weren't there?  
**Akira:** The hell, even you guys heard about that?  
**Kaoru:** So there really were side-effects?  
**Akira:** Nn? Wait-- You just baited me!  
**Kaoru:** You're the one who spilled the beans. But anyway, did you tell the investigation team Mihono might be 
thinking something bad?  
**Akira:** Haven't talked to them.  
**Akira:** It always feels like they're way too guarded with Mihono... I mean, I guess that's our fault though.  
**Kaoru:** I guess so. Though, just talking to us isn't going to make anything happen.  
**Kaoru:** Let's go ask Mihono about it.  

## 8: Mihono's Feelings
**Kanami:** Mihono-chan, no matter what, you can't go thinking it's okay to sacrifice yourself!  
**Mihono:** Wh-Where'd that come from, Kanami? Why're you so worked up...?  
**Mihono:** And also... Why'd you bring everybody here...?  
**Akira:** Sorry, it's all cause of me. I went and talked to Kaoru and Ellen, cause it was looking like you were 
thinking about giving yourself up...  
**Kaoru:** We'd be in trouble if Akira's pointless worrying actually meant something. So I got them along to really 
drive it home.  
**Ellen:** It's a show of virtue, Mihomiho!  
**Mihono:** Uh, I'm happy to hear that and all, but...  
**Chie:** Mihono-chan. I'll never let you do something like that.  
**Hiyori:** Agreed. Sacrificing somebody just to get out of this; nobody wants that.  
**Kiyoka:** Hono-chan, if you come up with any strange ideas... I'll stop you by force.  
**Mihono:** Kiyoka, when you say that holding your okatana, it's actually really scary...  
**Mihono:** And anyway, I wasn't thinking anything like that!!  
**Akira:** ...Seriously?  
**Mihono:** Seriously!  
**Mihono:** With Tagitsuhime, and Kanayamahime... with Kagutsuchi, trying to sacrifice one person never really fixed 
anything, did it?  
**Mihono:** Even if it did, all the people left would just be hurting inside... I'm dumb and even I can tell that!  
**Akira:** Wait, then what were you thinking about back then?  
**Mihono:** Back when?  
**Akira:** Back when we went to see Yuuki in the hospital!  
**Mihono:** Then...? About Kohime, I guess.  
**Kaoru:** Oi, are you changing the subject?  
**Chie:** Mihono-chan, can you explain everything from the start?  
**Mihono:** Ah, okay.  
**Mihono:** Well first, I was thinking, if we have to fight Kagutsuchi, we're definitely going to need Kanayamahime's 
power after all.  
**Mihono:** And that I should probably try something too, like how Kiyoka tried really hard to use Koryuu Kagemitsu.  
**Kiyoka:** Did you come up with anything?  
**Mihono:** Well, I figured I just shouldn't do that.  
**Ellen:** But why? You're right that, if we had Kanayamahime's help, fighting Kagutsuchi would go much easier.  
**Mihono:** I mean maybe.  
**Mihono:** But, Kanayamahime said the reason she's with me is cause she wants to be with me. Not because she wants to 
fight.  
**Kanami:** I think that's really nice... The way you thought this through.  
**Mihono:** Ehehe, thanks, Kanami.  
**Mihono:** So anyway, I was thinking... If we had Kohime around now maybe we could do something.  
**Mihono:** If Kohime were here, maybe we could talk to Kanayamahime and find out what she thinks.  
**Mihono:** Huh, it's from Kohime.  
**Chie:** Speak of the devil.  
**Mihono:** Wait, huhhhhhh!? Kohime's coming out here!?  

## 9: Toji (Me) and Aradama (You)
**Makoto:** Blue flames...  
**Makoto:** Am I... dreaming...?  
**Kagutsuchi:** ...  
**Makoto:** Are you... Kagutsuchi...? Why is it that you're afraid of toji...?  
**Kagutsuchi:** ...  
**Makoto:** Even here like this... I can feel your fear towards us...  
**Makoto:** But, why is that...  
**Kagutsuchi:** ...  
**Makoto:** ...I feel the same, Kagutsuchi.  
**Makoto:** I'm afraid of you (aradama) as well...  
**Makoto:** That, at any point, you might hurt the people dearest to me... scares me so much I can't help it...  
**Makoto:** That's why... I tried to use tamayori, so no one would be hurt...  
**Kagutsuchi:** ...  
**Makoto:** The both of us... We're somewhat similar like that...  
**Kagutsuchi:** ...?  
**Makoto:** Kagutsuchi...?  
**Makoto:** Something's coming...?  

## 10: Reunion with a Little Aradama
**Yukari:** I'm glad you could make it, Kohime.  
**Kohime:** I wanted to help Mihono too, so I'm glad you called for me.  
**Yukari:** ...Do you understand the situation?  
**Kohime:** The Sword Administration Bureau is in a stalemate. No one can push through the high temperature zone 
Kagutsuchi made.  
**Yukari:** That's right.  
**Kohime:** My role is to get near Kagutsuchi by moving through the torii gates. And talk to her if possible.  
**Kohime:** ...Is that wrong?  
**Yukari:** No, there's nothing wrong with your understanding of it.  
**Yukari:** Do you think you'll be able to withstand Kagutsuchi's heat?  
**Kohime:** I should be fine. When I practiced in Okinawa, I didn't have trouble.  
**Yukari:** I see. Still, keep your limits in mind.  
**Kohime:** I will.  
**Yukari:** I suppose that's all.  
**Yukari:** Though, now... There isn't much time, but you should meet with Asakura and the others.  
**Kohime:** Can I?  
**Yukari:** Yes; Asakura should be glad to see you.  
**Kohime:** Okay!  
**Kohime:** Mihono!  
**Mihono:** We were waiting for you, Kohime! It's been so long; have you been doing okay?  
**Kohime:** I have!  
**Kohime:** ...I'm sorry, Mihono.  
**Mihono:** Eh? Wh-What for!? Were you not doing okay!?  
**Kohime:** Not for that... I heard about what happened with Kanayamahime. When you were having so much trouble, I 
couldn't be with you.  
**Mihono:** That's okay. See, I'm doing just fine now!  
**Chie:** It's been a while, Kohime-chan. We were surprised to hear you came out here so suddenly.  
**Mirja:** For you to visit now of all times; it's related to Kagutsuchi, isn't it?  
**Kohime:** Mmhm, I'm going to go talk to her.  
**Kofuki:** Talk to her?  
**Kofuki:** Don't waste your time; just chop her to pieces. You got trained by Yukari-sama, didn't you?  
**Kohime:** I'm doing my best in training... but I'm not that strong yet.  
**Yui:** It hasn't been all that long since she started; she can't help it! But, once you're done, you should show us 
how strong you've gotten!  
**Kohime:** Okay!  
**Kiyoka:** Kohime-chan, Nitta-san also happens to be here now! We can call her right over.  
**Kohime:** Sorry, Kiyoka. I can't be here that long.  
**Kohime:** I'll talk to Hirona after I get back.  
**Mihono:** Oh... Don't push yourself too hard, okay?  
**Kohime:** I won't. I'm glad I got to see you all again. I have to go now!  
**Mihono:** Stay safe!  

## 11: Aradama in Company
**Kohime:** Okay, I'm going.  
**Yukari:** ...Don't force yourself to fight if it's unneeded.  
**Kohime:** I won't.  
**Kohime:** Nn? Something's on my back...  
**Nene:** Nene!  
**Kohime:** ...An aradama?  
**Kaoru:** Looks like we made it before you went.  
**Yukari:** Mashiko? Why are you here?  
**Kaoru:** I was fine with waiting for you to get back, but Nene wasn't hearing any of it.  
**Kohime:** Nene?  
**Kaoru:** That's this little guy's name.  
**Nene:** Ne!  
**Kaoru:** I think he really wanted to tell you something. Sorry, but could you give him a minute?  
**Yukari:** That's fine.  
**Nene:** Nene, nenene.  
**Kohime:** Yeah  
**Nene:** Nee... Ne?  
**Kohime:** Eh? But, then... Yukari. And, um...  
**Kaoru:** Mashiko Kaoru. Just Kaoru's fine.  
**Kohime:** Okay, Kaoru.  
**Kohime:** Kaoru... Nene says he wants to go together with me.  
**Kaoru:** Ahh... So that's why. Then, do you think you could bring him?  
**Kohime:** Well...  
**Kaoru:** If you're worried about Nene, don't be. He might not look like it, but he can at least watch out for himself.  
**Kohime:** Yukari...  
**Yukari:** I'll leave it up to you.  
**Kohime:** ...  
**Nene:** Nene! Nenenene!  
**Kohime:** ...Okay. Let's go talk to Kagutsuchi together.  
**Kaoru:** Good for you, Nene.  
**Nene:** Nene-!  
**Kohime:** Kaoru.  
**Kaoru:** What?  
**Kohime:** When I come back, could you tell me about you and Nene?  
**Kaoru:** Sure. I'll cancel my missions and hang around.  

## 12: Path of Flames (1)
**Kohime:** We're here... It sure is hot. Will you be okay, Nene?  
**Nene:** Ne~...  
**Kohime:** You can get through it? Then, let's hurry.  
**Nene:** Ne!  

## 13: Path of Flames (2)
**Kohime:** There's lots of aradama.  
**Nene:** Nenene...  
**Kohime:** Mm, they're really on guard for toji.  
**Kohime:** ...I don't think I can fight those yet. Can you, Nene?  
**Nene:** Nenene, nenene-!  
**Kohime:**  You can? You're amazing, Nene.  
**Nene:** Nene.  
**Nene:** ...Nee-.  
**Kohime:** Mm, it's hot. When we get back, I want to have a cold bath.  
**Nene:** Ne-, nene!  
**Kohime:** Yeah, with everyone...  
**Kohime:** Huh? It's not that hot here.  
**Nene:** Ne~.  
**Kohime:** Are you Kagutsuchi?  
**Kagutsuchi:** ...  
**Kohime:** I am Kohime. I came here to talk to you.  
**Nene:** Nene!!  

## 14: Breakdown
**Kohime:** Tell us, Kagutsuchi. Why did you say to kill Mihono?  
**Kagutsuchi:** ...  
**Kohime:** We shouldn't be involved with toji? Why do you think that?  
**Kagutsuchi:** ...  
**Kohime:** ...You're scared?  
**Kohime:** I understand that. Toji are there to kill us. That's scary...  
**Kohime:** But, Mihono wouldn't kill aradama if she didn't have to.  
**Kohime:** Aradama and humans can be friends! That's what Mihono taught me!  
**Nene:** Ne! Nenene!  
**Kohime:** Nene says so too.  
**Kohime:** So you should stop doing this! If you stop, toji won't use their okatana on you!  
**Kagutsuchi:** ...  
**Kohime:** It's not impossible!  
**Kohime:** Can't you just try talking once? Kagutsuchi!  
**Kagutsuchi:** ...  
**Kohime:** Aradama!?  
**Nene:** Ne!? Nenene!!  
**Kagutsuchi:** ...  
**Kohime:** ...I think they think we're the enemy.  
**Nene:** Ne-...  
**Kohime:** (We wouldn't be able to win against Kagutsuchi...)  
**Kohime:** Let's run, Nene!
