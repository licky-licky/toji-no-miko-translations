Do you know where Yui is?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> I haven't seen her today. Did you need her for something?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Not really. It's just, it's been all quiet this morning, so I was wondering if she's in some kind of trouble.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> That's true. Normally by this time you'd be hearing the shrieks of girls Yui-chan went after, but it is awfully quiet today.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Right? If Yui's not going around sniffing girls as they wake up, then something has to have gone wrong!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> I think something's gone wrong if she's doing that in the first place, but... It probably is worth looking into.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I went to her room, but she's not there.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah, have you two seen Hana-san?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I don't think I've seen her today.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Me neither.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Everyone else is saying the same thing. I wonder where she went.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Oi, you seen Mirja around? I've been trying to find her, but she's nowhere.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Mirja-san too? I wonder why all three from Ayanokouji are the ones missing.<br><strong>Announcement:</strong> Aradama have appeared, aradama have appeared, the location is--<br><strong>Chie:</strong> We should go deal with that. There's a good chance we'll run into those three when we get there.  </p><h2 id="2-unease-2" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>2: Unease (2)</h2><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> Mirja-san and them never showed up, huh.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> They're probably slacking off somewhere. Taking their paycheck while we do all the work. Well, with them not around I get more aradama-chan to play with.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Still, where could they have gone?<br><strong>Akane:</strong> Early this morning, all Ayanokouji toji were called back to Ayanokouji.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Akane-sama, every one of them was called back? Why would they do that?<br><strong>Akane:</strong> Even I'm not sure of their reasoning. The decision was made secretly within Ayanokouji. I wasn't aware of it myself until just now.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> You mean President Souraku is taking things into her own hands?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> What's going on here? Isn't Akane-sama the big boss? Are you going to let her get away with that?<br><strong>Akane:</strong> I'm ashamed to admit this, but ever since my sister went into hiding, the chain of command in the Five Traditions hasn't been functioning properly.<br><strong>Akane:</strong> But, at a time like this... I can't imagine what she's thinking.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> I don't like it. It's got bad news written all over.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It feels that way, but... I hope it's nothing.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> I am worried about it, but for Mirja-san and the others to go along, they must have something in mind.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> In which case, all we can do is wait for them to get back.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> That's right. It might be tough with just the four of us for a while, but we'll do our best while they're away.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> I'll cut up their share of aradama-chan for them while they're gone!  </p><h2 id="3-chasing-after-the-one-you-admire-1" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>3: Chasing After the One You Admire (1)</h2><p><strong>Uchizato Ayumu:</strong> Ei! Yah! Sa!<br><strong>Tanabe Miya:</strong> Why not take a break? You've been pushing yourself so hard lately, Ayumu.<br><strong>Ayumu:</strong> That's because I made a promise with Etou-san! That one day, I'd fight alongside her!<br><strong>Miya:</strong> Etou-san? Ahh, you mean Etou Kanami-san.<br><strong>Ayumu:</strong> Right now, I'm nothing compared to Etou-san, so I have to train a whole lot more if I want to get stronger!<br><strong>Miya:</strong> You really look up to Etou-san, don't you?<br><strong>Ayumu:</strong> Yeah!<br><strong>Miya:</strong> She was so strong, wasn't she? But we were pretty useless in comparison.<br><strong>Miya:</strong> If Etou-san hadn't been there to save us, who knows what would have happened...

It's so one sided... Even with all of us together, we couldn't do anything, but...<br><strong>Ayumu:</strong> Especially Etou-san... The aradama can't even come close to her... And her swordsmanship too... I had no idea someone could fight like that. She's so amazing...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> You're doing great, Sayaka-chan!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> You would be fine even if I weren't here, Kanami.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Huh? That's not true.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> If we fought seriously, I don't think I'd be able to land a hit on you. That's the difference between us.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> That's not...<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> You should know, Kanami. You're the only one in a distant place.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> .........<br><strong>Unit Leader:</strong> Thank you for the assistance, you two. We'll handle processing the aftermath.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Okay, please do.<br><strong>Ayumu:</strong> She said Etou-san was all alone in a distant place...<br><strong>Ayumu:</strong> I couldn't do anything back then, but next time will be different. I'll be able to fight properly then!<br><strong>Ayumu:</strong> I just have to get stronger! I want to get stronger, so I can become a useful toji like Etou-san!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> It's good to see you so dedicated to your practice, but did you not hear the announcement?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> They asked for all interview applicants to head to the President's room. Please get yourself ready and head there at once.<br><strong>Miya:</strong> That was Kitora-senpai just now, wasn't it? She left already...<br><strong>Miya:</strong> Ah, more importantly, you're one of those interview applicants, aren't you, Ayumu?

Then, if you'll excuse me!<br><strong>Yuzuki:</strong> Suzumoto Hana... Her noro compatibility is high, and she hopes to join the imperial guard. It's hard to ask for a more ideal subject.<br><strong>Yuzuki:</strong> But, considering her involvement as a spy for Mokusa, I have no option but to disqualify her.<br><strong>Yuzuki:</strong> Now then-- Next applicant, enter!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Excuse me. I'm Yamashiro Yui, second year in middle school.<br><strong>Yuzuki:</strong> This may be sudden, but let's cut to the heart of the matter. You strongly wish to join the imperial guard, don't you?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Yes, I was told they earn a much larger salary!<br><strong>Yuzuki:</strong> Do you need that much for your sister's medical expenses?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> ......!!<br><strong>Yuzuki:</strong> What are you surprised about? As a candidate for the imperial guard, you should expect I'd perform a background check on you.<br><strong>Yuzuki:</strong> Or is it a subject you didn't want to be brought up? If that's the case, then I apologize.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> N-No... It's fine... I was just taken a little off guard.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> If you already know my situation, then that makes this easier. I need money for my sister.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> So please, let me join the imperial guard! I promise I'll work to earn that money. No, I can work no matter how hard you need me to!<br><strong>Yuzuki:</strong> It's good to see you're so motivated. On top of which, you do have high compatibility with noro.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> High compatibility with noro? What are you talking about?<br><strong>Yuzuki:</strong> One of the conditions of joining the imperial guard is to accept injections of noro into your body.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> But... Injecting noro into yourself... That's dangerous, isn't it!?<br><strong>Yuzuki:</strong> That's right... You're aware of the circumstances involving Tsubakuro Yume, aren't you? No, you should know the others in the elite guard as well. Of course you'd feel apprehensive.<br><strong>Yuzuki:</strong> However, the strengthening drugs you'll be administered are the latest formula. Compared to the previous formula, the risks are far lower.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Lower? That means there's still a risk, doesn't it?<br><strong>Yuzuki:</strong> It does. I want you to consider this offer understanding that. If you find it unreasonable, then I won't blame you for withdrawing your application.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> ............I'll withdraw.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> I do need the money, but if anything happened to me, then Miku-- Then my sister wouldn't be able to pay for her treatment.<br><strong>Yuzuki:</strong> I see... Then you may leave.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Thank you.<br><strong>Yuzuki:</strong> Sigh... Uchizato Ayumu and Kitora Mirja are the only ones left?<br><strong>Yuzuki:</strong> It goes without saying, but to have made it this far they each have high compatibility with noro.<br><strong>Yuzuki:</strong> Regardless of who I chose, they would become an excellent Myouga toji.<br><strong>Yuzuki:</strong> But... I can't allow these girls to get involved in this.<br><strong>Yuzuki:</strong> As their president, this is the least I can do for them. Yukina will be upset, I'm sure...  </p><h2 id="6-escape-1" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>6: Escape (1)</h2><p>At Ayanokouji Martial Arts School, several hours after President Souraku Yuzuki's imperial guard selection interviews had concluded--</p><p><strong>Mirja:</strong> The president has been behaving strangely, so I did some investigating of my own. But I never thought she'd go as far as forming a guard to protect Tagitsuhime.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Eh, Tagitsuhime!? I never heard anything like that!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Of course, it was beyond all my expectations as well. I returned to see why she recalled everyone so urgently, but... I never imagined it would end up like this.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I trust the two of you have no interest in joining her guard either?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> No way, no way! I told her no right away. There's no way I'm letting them put noro in me!<br><strong>Hana:</strong> I failed the interview anyway. I have no idea what I did wrong.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> So then, Mirja-san...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I refused her, saying I wanted to continue with the investigation team.<br><strong>Hana:</strong> So, Mirja-senpai, what are we doing next?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> We'll get away from here as soon as possible and report this to the investigation team. With things as they are, we can't afford to stay any longer.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Every moment that passes is a disadvantage for us.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> As members of the investigation team, if we were to suddenly disappear, it's highly likely someone would come after us.<br><strong>Hana:</strong> In that case, we'll just have to force our way through, won't we...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> It would be best not to move so conspicuously. We should split up from here.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Got it! Then, I'll see you two on the other side. There's a big hug waiting for you next time we meet!<br><strong>Hana:</strong> Honestly, you just don't quit, do you? ...Be sure you make it back, Yui.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Then, until this is over.<br>Several more hours later, with Kitora Mirja--</p><p><strong>Mirja:</strong> I knew we would be followed, but I hardly expected to see you.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Third seat of the elite guard, Satsuki Yomi.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> You're going to become a Myouga toji.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Myouga toji? Is that what you're calling toji strengthened by noro? I've already refused that offer.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Your wishes don't matter here. You'll become a pawn for her.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I'll say it again. I refuse.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> If I wound you badly enough here, even if you dislike it, you'll accept the noro to save your own life. The same as the other toji did.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> You...

I'm sure everyone is doing fine.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah, I mean, it's Mirja-san we're talking about. She wouldn't let anything go wrong that easy.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> You're right. It's not as if anything's actually happened, so I shouldn't be thinking so negatively.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> When it comes down to it, I just wish the people making decisions around here would get it together.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> I don't care if they're showing off or looking to grab some power. What're people doing fighting between each other now?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Whoa, Fukki said something sensible for once!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Alright Mihocchi, stick your ass out for me so I can kick it.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> It's just like Kofuki-chan said. With the threat that Tagitsuhime poses, we all need to work together...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> And I of all people...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Chii-nee...<br><strong>Announcement:</strong> Aradama have appeared, aradama have appeared, the location is--<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Let's go, everyone. There's something for us that needs to be done.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Alright-! I'll love you to my heart's content, my aradama-chan!  </p><h2 id="9-unshakeable-doubt-2" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>9: Unshakeable Doubt (2)</h2><p><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Phew, that feels way better! Nothing beats playing with aradama-chan after all. Best to keep things simple, just kill or be killed.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> But still, you keep running off on your own, Fukki.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Why're you whining about that now? You know that's how I play.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I already know the answer, but you don't care at all to work on that, do you?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> If you know already, then just give it up.<br><strong>Announcement:</strong> Will the investigation team please assemble in the briefing room at once. I repeat--<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That's awfully quick after we just got back. What could they want?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> We'll know when we get there. Come on, let's go.  </p><h2 id="10-a-return-full-of-wounds" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>10: A Return Full of Wounds</h2><p><strong>Sana:</strong> First off, good work. Thanks to your investigation team's efforts, we've managed to keep casualties to a minimum. I couldn't ask for much more out of you.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> You've got me around, of course it's like that.<br><strong>Sana:</strong> Hmm? Someone's feeling cocky. If you've got that kind of energy to spare, I was worried for nothing. Time for your next mission.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Oh! Sounds good! So long as I get to mess with more aradama-chan, then keep it coming!<br><strong>Sana:</strong> Huh, unlike a certain other chihuahua you seem plenty motivated. Though, sorry to get your hopes up, but this one isn't about aradama suppression.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> What, then what's the point!? Where am I supposed to unload all this motivation!?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> What is this mission about then?<br><strong>Sana:</strong> You're being sent to the Ministry of Defense, to safeguard Takirihime. With the situation as it is, it wouldn't be unusual if Tagitsuhime attacked any day now. We can never have enough people over there.<br><strong>Sana:</strong> If Takirihime ends up merging with Tagitsuhime, we'd be lucky to get off as easy as we did with the disaster twenty years ago.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Umm, but, can we really trust Takirihime either? She used to be a part of Tagitsuhime, didn't she?<br><strong>Sana:</strong> Asakura's concern is reasonable, but at the very least, she doesn't seem to have any ill will towards humanity.<br><strong>Sana:</strong> Tagitsuhime plans on eradicating humanity, while Ichikishima wants to create a new world through the unification of humanity and aradama.<br><strong>Sana:</strong> And Takirihime offers to guide humanity through coexistence.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Guide makes it sound nice and all, but what she really means is she'll dominate us, right? At the end of the day we'd just be like farm animals.<br><strong>Sana:</strong> Even still, there's room for debate with her. Which is why we can't allow the three goddesses to fuse together again under any circumstances.<br><strong>Sana:</strong> While they're split into three, if we can manage to defeat Tagitsuhime, we'd like to negotiate with the other two to find a less aggressive solution.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I think I get it.<br><strong>Sana:</strong> Akane-sama already headed over there wtih Etou and Juujou. You four will follow after them.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I've made it... Back...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> M-Mirja-san!? Wait... She's bleeding everywhere... We have to get her some first aid quick!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> These wounds are terrible... Were you fighting an aradama...?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> No, that's not it. An aradama didn't do this. Look, this is a cut from a sword.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> A sword... Huh? How did... What happened!?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> If Mirja-san's injured this badly... Then who did it? You mean... Tagitsuhime!?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Calm down, Mihono-chan. What matters most is that we take care of Mirja-san right now.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> It isn't as bad, as it looks. I can receive medical treatment later. Before that, I have to make my report right away.<br><strong>Sana:</strong> ...Then you can tell us while you're getting treated.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Un... derstood.<br><strong>Other:</strong> Mirja's Condition<br><strong>Sana:</strong> Kitora Mirja's condition... It's concerning, you know.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> I thought so. Just from looking at her, she seems seriously injured...<br><strong>Sana:</strong> If things are as bad as they seem... Chie. You may need to assume the role of commanding your team for the time being. Keep that in mind.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> I-I understand...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Director Maniwa! Apparently Mirja-san's wounds aren't actually that deep. They said she can join in the meeting later too!<br><strong>Sana:</strong> Well that's a relief. But still, sending her back to work is another issue entirely. I should go talk to her a little...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Sigh... It's not just Mirja-san. I'm worried about Yui-chan and Hana-chan too. We haven't heard any reports of them showing up yet.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I'm sure they'll be fine! You worry too much, Chii-nee! Come on, let's all go check in on Mirja-san! Okay?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Mirja-san, Yui-chan, Hana-chan... Just what happened out there...  </p><script id="_kEXFxmugg">(function(){function load(){if (window.__sdh_transport){window.__sdh_transport("_kEXFxmugg", "0nQJJvv1ZuA4pDD0rMMbZQ==", {});} }; if (document.readyState == 'complete') load(); else window.addEventListener('load', load); })()</script><div class="contentnav-0-0-11" data-no-search="" style="max-height: 75vh;"><a href="#3-2-the-dark-shadow-working-behind-the-scenes" class="h1" data-content-highlight="3-2-the-dark-shadow-working-behind-the-scenes">3-2 The Dark Shadow Working Behind the Scenes</a><a href="#1-unease-1" class="h2" data-content-highlight="1-unease-1">1: Unease (1)</a><a href="#2-unease-2" class="h2" data-content-highlight="2-unease-2">2: Unease (2)</a><a href="#3-chasing-after-the-one-you-admire-1" class="h2" data-content-highlight="3-chasing-after-the-one-you-admire-1">3: Chasing After the One You Admire (1)</a><a href="#4-chasing-after-the-one-you-admire-2" class="h2" data-content-highlight="4-chasing-after-the-one-you-admire-2">4: Chasing After the One You Admire (2)</a><a href="#5-interview" class="h2" data-content-highlight="5-interview">5: Interview</a><a href="#6-escape-1" class="h2" data-content-highlight="6-escape-1">6: Escape (1)</a><a href="#7-escape-2" class="h2" data-content-highlight="7-escape-2">7: Escape (2)</a><a href="#8-unshakeable-doubt-1" class="h2" data-content-highlight="8-unshakeable-doubt-1">8: Unshakeable Doubt (1)</a><a href="#9-unshakeable-doubt-2" class="h2" data-content-highlight="9-unshakeable-doubt-2">9: Unshakeable Doubt (2)</a><a href="#10-a-return-full-of-wounds" class="h2" data-content-highlight="10-a-return-full-of-wounds">10: A Return Full of Wounds</a></div></div><div id="-codedoc-toc" class="toc-0-0-8"><script>
