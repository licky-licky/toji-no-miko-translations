## 1: Identity
**Suzuka:** --That's not her\. As far as I can tell from the footage, the strange hooded person who attacked those toji wasn't Maki-san\.  
**Suzuka:** However, there do seem to be two different hooded toji\. I don't doubt that one of them is Maki-san\.  
**Suzuka:** More than likely, what Mashiko-san and Itomi-san saw was the result of the unknown one's attack, and Maki-san immediately chasing after her\.  
**Suzuka:** She's always like this\.\.\. If you'd only stayed and explained yourself, you wouldn't be a suspect right now\.  
**Akane:** \.\.\.So you came to the same conclusion after all\.  
**Suzuka:** On that note, do you have any ideas as to the identity of the other hooded toji?  
**Akane:** \.\.\.She may have an okatana, but that doesn't mean she has to be a toji\.  
**Suzuka:** ? What do you mean?  
**Akane:** The strange hooded girl who has been attacking toji is none other than Tagitsuhime\.  
**Suzuka:** What--\!? Tagitsuhime was driven back to the netherworld though\.\.\.\!?  

After encountering the classified hooded toji, Mihono and the other members of the former investigation team completed their reassignment to Renpu Girls' School\.
At which point, they were made aware of that toji's identity--
  
**Mihono:** You mean, that toji was Tagitsuhime\!?  
**Mirja:** If the hooded toji we faced was actually Tagitsuhime, how would that be possible?  
**Kanami:** Hiyori-chan and I don't know much more than what Akane-sama explained to us, but\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.After our attack on her, the great aradama within Origami Yukari seems to have split into three\. Tagitsuhime, Takirihime, and Ichikishimahime\.  
**Hiyori:** Right now, the three of them don't appear like normal aradama, but are instead going around looking like people\. Each with their own free will\.  
**Hiyori:** And Tagitsuhime has been collecting noro from wherever she can\.  
**Kiyoka:** The great aradama split into three, and they're all acting on their own\.\.\.\!? Can it really do that\.\.\.\!\!  
**Chie:** What about the other two, Takirihime and Ichikishimahime\. Do you know where they are or what they're up to?  
**Hiyori:** Takirihime and Ichikishimahime are both separately kept under government protection\. I should mention, Kanami and I met Takirihime the other day\.  
**Mihono:** You and Kanami did\!?  
**Kofuki:** Mannn, I wanna meet her too\. I'd love to smash up another human shaped aradama, like Suruga\.  
**Yui:** If they're toji, then that means they're girls, right? If the great aradama's a girl\.\.\.  
**Hana:** Is that really all you picked up on, Yui? Here, take this 100 yen and go buy some ice cream\. I'll call you back when the serious conversation is over\.  
**Yui:** Ah, I won't mess around anymore\! I want to be with my friends-\!  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.Can I continue now?  
**Chie:** Sorry\. Please go on\.  

## 2: Tagitsuhime's Objective
**Hiyori:** After we fought it, the great aradama split into Tagitsuhime, Takirihime, and Ichikishimahime\. You're all clear on that much, right?  
**Mihono:** Yeah\. So it sounds like Tagitsuhime was the one who stole our noro just a little while ago\.  
**Kofuki:** Who'd have thought that was the great aradama\. If I'd have known, I would've have chased her down and kicked her ass\.  
**Mirja:** Is it safe to assume Tagitsuhime is gathering noro to recover her lost power?  
**Kanami:** That's probably what's happening\. After all, Takirihime said "Tagitsuhime is gaining strength\."  
**Kanami:** And also, when Hiyori-chan and I met her, she demanded we bring her Ichikishimahime\.  
**Chie:** Ichikishimahime\.\.\.? What does Takirihime plan on doing if she gets her? Isn't it possible that Takirihime could be trying to recover her lost strength too\.\.\.?  
**Yui:** Like, if Takirihime is trying to combine with Ichikishimahime? And then if they combine with Tagitsuhime, they can get all the power that was split up back together\.\.\. Or something like that?  
**Kiyoka:** I don't believe it\.\.\. Just when we thought it was sealed in the netherworld\.\.\.  
**Hana:** The situation is starting to sound awfully complicated\. What are we supposed to be doing about this, anyway?  
**Hiyori:** Don't panic\. There's still more to explain\.  
**Kanami:** Actually, not too long ago, Hiyori-chan and I fought Tagitsuhime\. I mean, the Tagitsuhime who came after they split into three\.  
**Mihono:** Ehh-\!? When did that happen\!?  

## 3: Maki's Request
**Kanami:** We just happened to be at the Ministry of Defense, when Tagitsuhime attacked the place\.  
**Kiyoka:** You just happened to be at the Ministry of Defense\.\.\. That's a pretty amazing story\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** Takirihime is being safeguarded at the Ministry of Defense\. That's what Tagitsuhime was after\.  
**Chie:** You mean, even though they were all one before, they're fighting with each other?  
**Mirja:** So in attempting to absorb Takirihime, Takirihime wants to take back her power while retaining her own will? Is that how it is?  
**Kanami:** Right\. When she split into three, it seems like each of them became their own individual\.  
**Kanami:** I can't really explain it, but, when I talked to Takirihime, she seemed different from the Tagitsuhime we all fought before\. I think, maybe she isn't our enemy right now\.  
**Yui:** An aradama that isn't our enemy\.\.\. So like Nene, who's always with Kaoru-san?  
**Kanami:** And also, when the two of us fought Tagitsuhime, she was so strong that neither of us could do anything to her\.  
**Mihono:** Even with you and Juujou-san together\!?  
**Kofuki:** That's the best\.\.\. I wanna try fighting her too\.\.\.\!\!  
**Kanami:** But then Shidou-san came to back us up\. With her help, we were able to get a bit of an advantage, but then Tagitsuhime suddenly disappeared in the middle of the fight\.  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.After the battle, Shidou Maki spoke to us\. Saying she had two objectives right now\.  
**Hiyori:** One was suppressing Tagitsuhime\. And the other was recovering something vital to making that happen\.  
**Hana:** Vital to suppressing Tagitsuhime? Recover what?  
**Kanami:** Right\. What Shidou-san said was\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** "I want to save Tsubakuro Yume from the netherworld\."  

## 4: A Single Possibility
**Kiyoka:** There's a way to bring back Tsubakuro-san after she died? Are you serious\.\.\.?  
**Mirja:** I don't believe it\. How would you even begin to\.\.\.  
**Suzuka:** We'll take over the explanation from here\.  
**Hana:** -\!? Konohana Suzuka-san, Shidou Maki-san\.\.\.\!\!  
**Maki:** To combat powerful aradama, we in the elite guard injected noro into our bodies\.  
**Maki:** To make that power our own, we accepted, used the noro\.  
**Maki:** \.\.\.And still, Yume lost her life\.  
**Suzuka:** Yume's passing wasn't something we could take so easily\.\.\. We couldn't help but search for anything we could do\.\.\.  
**Suzuka:** At the end of it all, there was one possibility we found\.  
**Suzuka:** With your help, Yume may still be able to be sa--  
**Chie:** Why should we help you\!?  
**Mihono:** Ch-Chii-nee\!? What's gotten into you\!?  
**Chie:** That girl, Tsubakuro-san, was responsible for the destruction of Mokusa\. Saving someone like that\.\.\. I want nothing to do with it\.  
**Maki:** \.\.\.We didn't know the truth back then\.  
**Chie:** That doesn't mean I'm going to forgive you\!  
**Yui:** H-Hey, calm down, Chie-san\. Why don't we at least hear Suzuka-san out all the way to the end?  
**Chie:** \.\.\.\.\.\.I know\. I know, that this is just my own selfish feelings\. Please, keep going\.  
**Akane:** Then, why don't I be the one to explain to you all?  
**Kanami:** --Eh-\!? Akane-sama\!?  

## 5: Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu
**Akane:** There's a possibility that Tsubakuro-san, who accepted strength from aradama, could still be living on in the netherworld\.  
**Akane:** And, using the utsushi of Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu that Setouchi-san possesses, there's a chance we could call Tsubakuro-san from the netherworld back to our own\.  
**Chie:** The utsushi of Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu\.\.\.\!?  
**Akane:** Sixty years ago, the real Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu was used to defeat the great aradama-- To make things easier, we'll call it "Kai"\.  
**Akane:** Tethered to this Kai, in the depths of the netherworld, should be the real Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu\.  
**Akane:** What you have\.\.\. No, what remains in the present world, is the utsushi of Kagemitsu\. So long as it remains here, that must mean the original continues to exist in the netherworld\.  
**Akane:** As for the method of saving Tsubakuro Yume-san\. To put it simply, Ichikishimahime will act as a medium-- Guiding you into the netherworld\.  
**Akane:** And, using that utsushi of Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu, you will need to defeat Kai\.  
**Akane:** In doing so, the real Kagemitsu, bound to Kai in the netherworld, should be returned to you\.  
**Akane:** Then, with the real Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu, if you could find and break the chains binding Tsubakuro-san to the netherworld, it's possible we could call her back here  
**Akane:** The Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu which sent Kai to the netherworld sixty years ago had that much power within it\.  
**Akane:** However, with no precedent for this, this possibility is ultimately no more than conjecture upon conjecture\.  
**Mirja:** I-If something like that works\.\.\. To begin with, this Kagemitsu wasn't a replica, but an actual utsushi\.\.\.?  
**Yui:** \.\.\.Mihono-chan\. Are you getting any of this?  
**Mihono:** B-Bits and pieces\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** I don't exactly understand it all either, but, can people from the real world actually travel into the netherworld\.\.\.?  
**Kofuki:** Yeah, is it really safe for us to go into the netherworld like that? There's gotta be a chance we can't make it out either, right?  
**Akane:** For those concerns, we're depending on Ichikishimahime's assistance\. With her help, this plan becomes possible\.  
**Hana:** \.\.\.Chie-san, what will you do? From listening to their proposal, at the very least, Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu's utsushi is an absolute requirement\.  
**Chie:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Maki:** I won't ask you to forget all the things we've done\.  
**Maki:** But please, won't you consider helping us to recover Yume? This is all to help in defeating Tagitsuhime\.  
**Suzuka:** Yume capabilities surpass even Maki-san\. In the fight against Tagitsuhime, Yume's strength will be critical\.  
**Maki:** I'm begging you\! So long as there's a chance, we have to take it\!  
**Suzuka:** Please, consider it\!  
**Chie:** (\.\.\.What am I supposed to do? Was this why President Souraku left Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu's utsushi under my supervision, so I'd be forced to make a choice like this\.\.\.?\)  
**Mirja:** (\.\.\.Something's not right about this proposal\. This operation revolves around the usage of Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu's utsushi\.\.\.\)  
**Mirja:** (And yet, why is Origami Akane the one proposing it, and not President Souraku, who formed the investigation team and entrusted Setouchi Chie with the utsushi of Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu\.\.\.?\)  
**Mirja:** (What's happening to Ayanokouji Martial Arts School, to President Souraku\.\.\.?\)
