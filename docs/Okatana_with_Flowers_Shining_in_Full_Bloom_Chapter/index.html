Just like that!? I wanted to hang around with Yuuna-chan and Tougou-san longer at least!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> And I wanted to have a practice fight with Karin-chan and Fuu-san, and I wanted to get to know Sonoko-chan and Itsuki-chan a little better...<br>
<strong>Nogi Sonoko:</strong> I&#x27;m sad to hear it too... But the gods don&#x27;t give preference to people&#x27;s circumstances.<br>
<strong>Yuuki Yuuna:</strong> Still, I&#x27;m glad. This means Kanami-chan and the rest get to go back to their home world now.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Yuuna-chan! Tougou-san! Fuu-san! Karin-chan! Sonoko-chan! Itsuki-chan!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I hope someday, we can meet--<br>
<strong>Inubouzaki Fuu:</strong> I guess they&#x27;re gone. We didn&#x27;t get a chance to talk much, but they seemed like good people.<br>
<strong>Inubouzaki Itsuki:</strong> ...Mm, I wanted to ask them what things were like in their world.<br>
<strong>Miyoshi Karin:</strong> What happens once will happen twice. I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll see each other again.<br>
<strong>Sonoko:</strong> That&#x27;s right~. Maybe next time, we&#x27;ll be the ones dropping by their world.<br>
<strong>Tougou Mimori:</strong> When Sonocchi says it, it feels like it could actually happen.<br>
<strong>Yuuna:</strong> But you know, that would definitely be fun too! So... Let&#x27;s see them again someday!<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> ooo... oooOOOOOOOO!!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...Huh? It&#x27;s not here? That&#x27;s strange... I know I put it in here though...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> What are you doing with your head stuck in the fridge, Kiyoka-chan? Your butt&#x27;s wide open.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Uwah!?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Th-The pudding I bought for the investigation team to eat together is missing...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Well that sounds like trouble.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Y-Yeah...<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> What&#x27;re you covering up your skirt for?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Turns out, the pudding that Kiyoka-chan bought went missing.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Pudding? I remember Mihono had some with her earlier.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Hono-chan had... I see, so Hono-chan did it again... How many times have I told her...!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Thank you for your help, Kaoru-san.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> S-Sure.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...Kiyoka&#x27;s weirdly fired up, isn&#x27;t she.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> ...That&#x27;s for sure. I&#x27;ve never seen Kiyoka-chan looking that mad before. Mihono-chan... Amen.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Hono-chan!!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Eep!? ...Oh, Kiyoka? Wh-What&#x27;s with that scary face you&#x27;re making?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...Did you eat the pudding?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Pudding? Ah, if you mean the stuff in the fridge, then I ate it. It was really yummy!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Of course it was yummy!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That was the pudding I lined up to buy because I thought we could all eat it together!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> It was!?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> S-Sorry... But, I didn&#x27;t know...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Just because you didn&#x27;t know, does that mean you can eat whatever pudding you find in the fridge!?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Uu...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You&#x27;re horrible, Hono-chan!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> A mission, now!?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Let&#x27;s see, strong aradama have simultaneously appeared in multiple locations. Hurry to the site at once. The members are as follows: Konohana-san, Yui, Kaoru-san, me, and...... Kiyoka.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Are you all prepared? We&#x27;re leaving now.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> My, what a tense atmosphere. Did something happen between those two?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Y&#x27;see, they&#x27;re actually in the middle of a fight...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Of all things... I&#x27;m worried for how this will go now.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> There was a report of a strange group of girls being sighted at where we&#x27;re headed as well...<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> A strange group of girls?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> That&#x27;s right, a group of girls engaging the aradama without okatana... Using everything from guns, to wires, to even their fists... Or so they said.<br>
<strong>Yuuna:</strong> HERO PUUUNCH!<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> OOOOOOOOOOOO!<br>
<strong>Yuuna:</strong> Uwawa!<br>
<strong>Tougou:</strong> Fall back, Yuuna-chan! I&#x27;ll cover you!<br>
<strong>Sonoko:</strong> Hmmm, like I thought, with only us here, no matter how much we weaken them, we don&#x27;t seem to be able to defeat aradama~.<br>
<strong>Sonoko:</strong> On top of that, compared to the ones we fought in the Jukai, these seem even stronger. I wonder why that is?<br>
<strong>Karin:</strong> We can wonder about that later; focus on the fight right now! HAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!<br>
<strong>Itsuki:</strong> Pant, pant... This is too different from fighting against vertex... If only those toji were here...!<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> Just keep at it, girls! Actually... Where is here anyway!?  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="2-heroes-once-more"></a>2: Heroes Once More<a class="hash-link" href="#2-heroes-once-more" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Yuuna:</strong> TEYAAAAAAAAA-!!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ooh, there really were some cuties going at it without any okatana!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Go on-! Hit it right there-! Punch punch punch!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> The sight alone gives me a headache... But this isn&#x27;t the time to stand around watching.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Move in to protect them!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka/Mihono/Yui:</strong> Right!<br>
<strong>Itsuki:</strong> O-Onee-chan! I think it&#x27;s getting to be too much...!<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> I know, but... Aghh, come on! If we just had a few extra hands here!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Looks like we made good timing then. HAAA!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Are you okay!?<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> Ah-! It&#x27;s you...!<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> Showing up in a pinch; now you&#x27;re the ones acting like heroes! ...Thanks, Mihono!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Eh? Why do you know my name... Huh? Where have I seen you before...<br>
<strong>Yuuna:</strong> Look, Tougou-san! Mihono-chan came to help us!<br>
<strong>Tougou:</strong> Kiyoka-chan is here too... These are some reliable reinforcements.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You know my name...?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> HAAA-!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Are these girls acquaintances of yours, Asakura-san, Musumi-san?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I don&#x27;t know them... I think.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Right... I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ve ever met, but...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...I&#x27;m not sure I understand the situation, but it would be best to talk it over after we&#x27;re done. First, let&#x27;s suppress these aradama!<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> Honestly, we get thrown into who knows where all of a sudden, and then there&#x27;s aradama? Mihono and them really saved us.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Um-... You keep talking like we know each other, but, have we met before?<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> Eh!? You don&#x27;t remember?<br>
<strong>Yuuna:</strong> What about me!? I&#x27;m Yuuki Yuuna! I&#x27;m a &quot;Hero&quot;!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Sorry, I don&#x27;t know you.<br>
<strong>Yunna:</strong> Come on~. What about Kiyoka-chan!?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I don&#x27;t know you either...<br>
<strong>Tougou:</strong> What&#x27;s going on, Sonocchi?<br>
<strong>Sonoko:</strong> Hmmm, it might be hard for the toji to form memories of what happens in the Jukai... Maybe it was only like a dream to them.<br>
<strong>Karin:</strong> Well, even if they forgot, they&#x27;re still the same as before. So we shouldn&#x27;t have to worry about it then, right?<br>
<strong>Itsuki:</strong> That&#x27;s true... You&#x27;re right! I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll be friends again right away!<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> It&#x27;s still kind of unfortunate, but what can you do.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I don&#x27;t really know what&#x27;s going on, but, sorry.<br>
<strong>Yuuna:</strong> No, it&#x27;s okay, you don&#x27;t have to apologize for anything!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Are you finished talking? Leaving that aside, there are plenty of things I would like to ask you all.<br>
<strong>Itsuki:</strong> Wawa, a sort of scary person&#x27;s here...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I am from the Special Sword Administration Bureau, Konohana Suzuka, second seat of the elite guard. And you are?<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> Third year at Sanshu Middle School, Inubouzaki Fuu. All of us are &quot;Heroes&quot;.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Heroes...? So you aren&#x27;t toji after all. You don&#x27;t appear to be using the weapons of a toji...<br>
<strong>Yuuna:</strong> That&#x27;s right! I&#x27;m a second year at Sanshu Middle School! I&#x27;m Yuuki Yuuna, the Hero!<br>
<strong>Tougou:</strong> Second year at Sanshu Middle School, Tougou Mimori.<br>
<strong>Karin:</strong> Second year at Sanshu, a Hero, I&#x27;m Miyoshi Karin.<br>
<strong>Itsuki:</strong> Umm, I&#x27;m a first year at Sanshu Middle School, Inubouzaki Itsuki...<br>
<strong>Sonoko:</strong> Likewise, I&#x27;m a second year at Sanshu, Nogi Sonoko&#x27;s here~!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Sanshu Middle School... Not part of the Five Traditions either, then.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Even though you aren&#x27;t toji, you fight aradama. I find that hard to believe. We&#x27;ll need to conduct an investigation.<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> Ahaha, this is the second time we&#x27;ve gone through this, isn&#x27;t it... Kitora-san said the same sort of thing.<br>
<strong>Yuuna:</strong> Anyway, Konohana-san! Where in Shikoku are we?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Shikoku? We aren&#x27;t there; this is nearby to Kamakura.<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> Kamakura!?<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> ...Kamakura, as in, the Kamakura Shogunate?<br>
<strong>Tougou:</strong> ...No, I think it&#x27;s a city in the Kanagawa Prefecture that was once said to exist in Kanto.<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> Kanto!? Isn&#x27;t Kanto something from ancient history!?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> What are you saying? Kanto is currently right here.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> This conversation&#x27;s kinda all over the place...<br>
<strong>Yuuna:</strong> U-Uhhh... What if this is... like we learned about in history class, the time before the Era of the Gods...?<br>
<strong>Itsuki:</strong> What does that mean then!? Did we time travel?<br>
<strong>Sonoko:</strong> Take a deep breath~, Yuuyu, Ittsun. I think what happened is the opposite of what happened last time.<br>
<strong>Sonoko:</strong> Before, the toji came to the Jukai, and oppositely, the Heroes have now come to the toji world... That&#x27;s all.<br>
<strong>Sonoko:</strong> The Japan in the world the toji are from would have followed a completely different course of history to ours.<br>
<strong>Yuuna:</strong> Oh. We didn&#x27;t get the ask the toji about what their world was like back then, so that&#x27;s what happened...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Now then... What should we do about this. I can&#x27;t quite follow what it is you&#x27;re all talking about.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Um, Konohana-san? I think we can trust them. They don&#x27;t seem like they&#x27;re bad or anything...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> That&#x27;s right! That&#x27;s right! Girls that cute could never be bad people!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Ignoring what Yui&#x27;s saying, they don&#x27;t seem like they&#x27;d be our enemies. So wouldn&#x27;t taking them into protective custody be the right thing to do here?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I think that would be for the best too...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...Well, that&#x27;s true.<br>
<strong>Itsuki:</strong> Sigh, thank goodness-. It doesn&#x27;t look like things will get rough...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Besides, responding to the mass outbreak of aradama takes priority over dealing with you girls.<br>
<strong>Yuuna:</strong> Are there really that many aradama out there?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah, and they&#x27;re tough aradama too! It&#x27;s an abnormal situation!<br>
<strong>Yuuna:</strong> It is? Then, we&#x27;ll help you defeat the aradama too!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> You will? Thanks!<br>
<strong>Tougou:</strong> But, Yuuna-chan, we&#x27;ll have to come up with a way to return to our own world as soon as we can.<br>
<strong>Tougou:</strong> If something were to happen to our world while we&#x27;re away...<br>
<strong>Yuuna:</strong> Ah, that&#x27;s right... Still, we can&#x27;t just ignore the aradama either...<br>
<strong>Sonoko:</strong> You&#x27;re so kind, Yuuyu~.<br>
<strong>Sonoko:</strong> Mm, I think I agree with Yuuyu here. And also, we can&#x27;t be sure whether the abnormal outbreak of aradama and our coming to this world isn&#x27;t related somehow.<br>
<strong>Itsuski:</strong> What do you mean?<br>
<strong>Sonoko:</strong> It might be that the Shinju-sama sent us here to this world, telling us to stop the aradama.<br>
<strong>Tougou:</strong> I see... That might be a possibility...<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> It&#x27;s not like we know how to get back to our world, so it should be fine to take care of all these aradama for the time being.<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> So that means, all us Heroes are going to help out with the aradama suppression!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Hooray! You can never have too many girls that&#x27;ll fight right alongside you!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> When you talk like that, Yui-chan, I can only ever feel evil intentions...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> What&#x27;s that, Kiyoka-chan~, are you jealous? Don&#x27;t worry, you&#x27;re still my number 1!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Sigh...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> The Hero girls are going to fight with us! That&#x27;ll be a big help!<br>
<strong>Yuuna:</strong> Yeah, let&#x27;s all do whatever we can!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Hold it right there, we haven&#x27;t yet decided for you to fight...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Your punches were awesome, Yuuna! I wanna try that too.<br>
<strong>Yuuna:</strong> If you became a Hero, I bet you could do it too, Mihono-chan! You&#x27;re likely to succeed if you try!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> A Hero-! Yeah, where there&#x27;s a will, there&#x27;s a way!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> They&#x27;ve totally hit it off already.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> It seems there&#x27;s no way around it. I&#x27;ll report to Yukari-sama... As per my discretion in the field, these girls are permitted to fight alongside us.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="3-hero-club-emergency-activity"></a>3: Hero Club Emergency Activity!<a class="hash-link" href="#3-hero-club-emergency-activity" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> HAAAA-!<br>
<strong>Yuuna:</strong> EIII--!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> HAA-!<br>
<strong>Tougou:</strong> I&#x27;ll provide covering fire!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Alright, I think we beat it. Ah, Kiyoka...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> KIEEEEEEE!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Phew, looks like all the aradama around here are dealt with. I wanna hurry back and catch some rest...<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> It sure feels good having you toji with us against these aradama.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Not just that. We wouldn&#x27;t be able to suppress them so smoothly if not for your help.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Now then, it seems a detached unit will be dealing with the aradama that appeared elsewhere, so we&#x27;ll be on standby for the time being.<br>
<strong>Yuuna:</strong> I&#x27;m bored, Tougou-saaan.<br>
<strong>Tougou:</strong> Here, have some botamochi.<br>
<strong>Yuuna:</strong> Ohmm... It&#x27;s tasty.<br>
<strong>Karin:</strong> ...What are you two even doing?<br>
<strong>Itsuki:</strong> Heh. They said we&#x27;re on standby, but since we don&#x27;t know what to do, it&#x27;s a little troubling isn&#x27;t it.<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> Does anybody have anything they want to do?<br>
<strong>Yuuna:</strong> Ah, it&#x27;s not exactly something I want to do, but there is something I&#x27;m interested in!<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> Go, Yuuna!<br>
<strong>Yuuna:</strong> I haven&#x27;t seen Mihono-chan and Kiyoka-chan talking to each other!<br>
<strong>Sonoko:</strong> That&#x27;s right, things seem a little tense between them. Could they be fighting?<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> In that case, let&#x27;s ask someone who&#x27;ll know.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I&#x27;ve been called on!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> So, what is it you wanted to ask us?<br>
<strong>Yuuna:</strong> About Mihono-chan and Kiyoka-chan, are they fighting?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ah-, it&#x27;s about that-.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> The truth is, Mihono-chan ate the pudding Kiyoka-chan bought.<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> That&#x27;ll mean war.<br>
<strong>Itsuki:</strong> ...Though, at times like these, you&#x27;re the one who eats the pudding, Onee-chan.<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> Ahaha... A-Anyway, if that&#x27;s the case, the Hero Club needs to take action!<br>
<strong>Yuuna:</strong> Today&#x27;s Hero Club activity is to get Mihono-chan and Kiyoka-chan to make up! Right?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Hero club? ...What&#x27;s that?<br>
<strong>Yuuna:</strong> We&#x27;re a club that goes out with a good heart to do what we can to help everyone! That&#x27;s why we&#x27;re the Hero Club!、<br>
<strong>Tougou:</strong> We do club activities at our middle school. If someone is in trouble or needs assistance, we give them a helping hand.<br>
<strong>Yuuna:</strong> Whether it&#x27;s looking for foster parents for a cat, or cleaning up the neighborhood, or helping out at the Children&#x27;s Festival! We&#x27;ll take on helping friends make up too!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Like halfway between a jack of all trades and a volunteer group then.<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> Well, if I had to put it simply, it&#x27;s something like that.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> A club! So that means, you Heroes always group up in a club room and do your activities!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> All these cute girls! All grouped up in one room! What a wonderful secret garden!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Fuu-san! I&#x27;m going to join the Hero Club too!! I&#x27;ll fill out a club entry form straight away!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> What are you even going on about...<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> Let&#x27;s get back on topic! Today&#x27;s Hero Club activity is~~... Tadah! We&#x27;ll get Mihono and Kiyoka on friendly terms again!<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> Does anyone have any good ideas?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Hmm, Kiyoka-chan was strangely mad this time, so I don&#x27;t think she&#x27;ll let Mihono-chan off very easy.<br>
<strong>Sonoko:</strong> A grudge over pudding is a fearsome thing after all~.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Keep eating it over and over and anybody&#x27;s patience&#x27;ll run out.<br>
<strong>Yuuna:</strong> Hmm, what should we do then, Tougou-san.<br>
<strong>Tougou:</strong> It&#x27;s difficult, isn&#x27;t it.<br>
<strong>Tougou:</strong> If I were angry at Yuuna-chan, I would forgive her as soon as she apologized though...<br>
<strong>Karin:</strong> What if she gives her a set of high grade supplements and niboshi?<br>
<strong>Itsuki:</strong> I think you&#x27;re the only one who would forgive someone with that, Karin-san...<br>
<strong>Yuuna:</strong> I know! Since they&#x27;re fighting over pudding, wouldn&#x27;t it work if they make up over pudding too?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> You mean, if we buy the same pudding that Kiyoka-chan bought, she&#x27;ll forgive her?<br>
<strong>Yuuna:</strong> No, what she should give her has got to be homemade! She can make up with Kiyoka-chan with homemade pudding!<br>
<strong>Yuuna:</strong> So that&#x27;s why, Mihono-chan, let&#x27;s make pudding in a bucket, and then you can make up with Kiyoka-chan!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Yuuna, Tougou-san, Sonoko... And Kaoru-san too, thanks, for coming to help me!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I&#x27;ll give my best attempt at making  a bucket of pudding!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...At what point did it become a bucket of pudding?<br>
<strong>Yuuna:</strong> If you&#x27;re trying to make up with someone, bigger is always best!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah! A bucket of pudding would definitely make her happier than normal pudding!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...These two are just peas in a pod, huh.<br>
<strong>Sonoko:</strong> So long as they&#x27;re having a good time~. By the way, do you know how to make pudding?<br>
<strong>Yuuna:</strong> Ah, I don&#x27;t know how...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I don&#x27;t either...<br>
<strong>Tougou:</strong> Don&#x27;t worry, Yuuna-chan, Mihono-chan. I know how you make it.<br>
<strong>Sonoko:</strong> Wasshi, you can make western sweets too~?<br>
<strong>Tougou:</strong> Japanese fare is my specialty, but it isn&#x27;t like I completely dislike western sweets.<br>
<strong>Tougou:</strong> You know that, don&#x27;t you, Sonocchi? We had gelatto together after all.<br>
<strong>Sonoko:</strong> Ahaha, that is true~.<br>
<strong>Tougou:</strong> Anyway, I&#x27;ll coach you through how to make it. Since we&#x27;re making pudding, let&#x27;s make the tastiest pudding we can!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah!<br>
<strong>Tougou:</strong> That&#x27;s a good serious look in your eyes, Mihono-chan!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I&#x27;m the one who ate Kiyoka&#x27;s pudding, after all.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> That&#x27;s why, I&#x27;ll make pudding that&#x27;s way yummier than that pudding, and make up with Kiyoka for sure!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> I mean, there&#x27;s no way you&#x27;re going to beat pudding that was up for sale.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Where there&#x27;s a will, there&#x27;s a way!<br>
<strong>Yuuna:</strong> Yeah, that&#x27;s the spirit, Mihono-chan! You&#x27;ll make up with Kiyoka-chan for sure!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Ah, I messed up.<br>
<strong>Tougou:</strong> Don&#x27;t worry, we brought Sonocchi and Kaoru-san along just for moments like these.<br>
<strong>Kaoru/Sonoko:</strong> ...Huh?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I did it... I did it, Yuuna!<br>
<strong>Yuuna:</strong> You did it, Mihono-chan!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Burp... G-Great... If you messed up any more... I couldn&#x27;t eat any more...<br>
<strong>Sonoko:</strong> Partway through... I started to feel like I was the one being eaten by the pudding instead...  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="4-kiyokas-feelings"></a>4: Kiyoka&#x27;s Feelings<a class="hash-link" href="#4-kiyokas-feelings" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>While Mihono was making bucket pudding with Yuuna and the others...</p><p><strong>Fuu:</strong> Then, Kamakura!<br>
<strong>Karin:</strong> We sure are in Kamakura, but... Were you really supposed to use &quot;Then, Kamakura!&quot; at times like this? 		[When major incidents happened during the Kamakura Shogunate, all samurai would be summoned to Kamakura, and over time this phrase just came to mean &quot;in case of emergency&quot;]<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> Don&#x27;t sweat the small things! Right now, let&#x27;s have our fill of Kamakura!<br>
<strong>Itsuki:</strong> Kiyoka-san, Yui-san. Thank you for taking us to see the sights on such short notice.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> If a pretty looking girl like you is asking me to show her around, then I&#x27;m all over it!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Right, Kiyoka-chan!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Kiyoka-chan?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah, sorry, I wasn&#x27;t listening. What is it?<br>
<strong>Itsuki:</strong> Thank you for taking us sightseeing, Kiyoka-san.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It&#x27;s fine, it&#x27;s nothing to show you around!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> ...Kiyoka-chan&#x27;s head is off in the clouds.<br>
<strong>Itsuki:</strong> Do you think her fight with Mihono-san is bothering her after all?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> That&#x27;s probably it. I&#x27;ve never seen them fighting for this long before...<br>
<strong>Itsuki:</strong> I hope we can make things up between them here... We&#x27;ll have to do our best to take Kiyoka-san out around town until Mihono is finished with her bucket pudding!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Itsuki-chan, you&#x27;re so considerate... I love you!<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> Whoa now! Before you lay a hand on my Itsuki, you&#x27;ll have to go through me first!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Then it&#x27;s a duel!<br>
<strong>Karin:</strong> ...What&#x27;re they playing around for.<br>
<strong>Karin:</strong> Honestly... Kiyoka, is there any spots you&#x27;d recommend we go see?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Karin:</strong> Sigh. If it&#x27;s bothering you that much, then why are you even fighting with her in the first place?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Uu... Wh-Why do you know about that...<br>
<strong>Karin:</strong> Anyone can tell just by seeing you two. Mihono ate your pudding, didn&#x27;t she?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You can tell that much just by looking!?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ah, sorry. I told them about that part.<br>
<strong>Karin:</strong> I think it&#x27;s Mihono&#x27;s fault for eating the pudding, but have you not considered apologizing to her yourself?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> But... This isn&#x27;t even the first time Hono-chan has eaten someone&#x27;s pudding either...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> And also, I was looking forward to sharing it with everyone too...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> This time, I just wanted Hono-chan to apologize...<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> I understand!<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> A grudge over food is a fearsome thing~. I know if somebody ate the udon I was looking forward to having myself, I&#x27;d be mad for sure.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Y-You would, wouldn&#x27;t you!<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> But you know, Kiyoka. If Mihono never apologizes, what happens then?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Th-Then... I wouldn&#x27;t like that.<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> In that case, you don&#x27;t have to think so hard about it.  If you want to make up with her, you just have to do it.<br>
<strong>Itsuki:</strong> If you said you wanted to make up with her, I&#x27;m sure Mihono-san would be happy to hear it.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...You think so?<br>
<strong>Itsuki:</strong> I do!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...Just give me a minute!<br>
<strong>Karin:</strong> Hey, where are you going!?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I&#x27;m going... to buy some pudding!<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> Good then, that&#x27;s a case closed.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> And a happy ending...<br>
<strong>Itsuki:</strong> Wait, that&#x27;s not good! If she goes back now, Mihono-san is still in the middle of making bucket pudding!<br>
<strong>Yui/Fuu:</strong> Ah.<br>
<strong>Karin:</strong> There&#x27;s no other way around it. Yui, tell us some famous sightseeing places.<br>
<strong>Karin:</strong> That&#x27;s what we said to bring her out here to begin with, so when she gets back, we&#x27;ll just do that to waste time like we planned.<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> That ability to think on your feet... That&#x27;s my Hero Club!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Karin-chan... I love you!<br>
<strong>Karin:</strong> You&#x27;ll go for anyone, huh.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...I wonder if I can really make up with Hono-chan.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Considering it&#x27;s Mihono-chan, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll go fine.<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> That&#x27;s right, Hero Club tenet number 5! You&#x27;re likely to succeed if you try!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...Aha! I can do it if I try, right!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Kiyoka, I&#x27;m sorry!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Eh? A big, pudding...?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Y-Yeah, Yuuna said, I needed pudding to make up for pudding... That&#x27;s why, I worked real hard to make a bucket full of pudding!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Umm, I followed Fuu-san&#x27;s advice too, and I bought you some pudding...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Eh, you got some too...?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Y-Yeah...<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> Fu fu, no use hiding it now that it&#x27;s come out! That&#x27;s right, in order to bring you two back together, the Hero Club was pulling the strings the whole time!<br>
<strong>Mihono/Kiyoka:</strong> Pfft, ahahaha!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Sorry again, Kiyoka.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> No, I&#x27;m sorry too, Hono-chan!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="5-mankai"></a>5: Mankai<a class="hash-link" href="#5-mankai" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Suzuka:</strong> An aradama&#x27;s signal has been detected. Is everyone ready?<br>
<strong>Mihono/Kiyoka:</strong> Yes!<br>
<strong>Yuuna:</strong> Alright, let&#x27;s do our best-!<br>
<strong>Sonoko:</strong> It feels fresh and exciting protecting somewhere outside of Shikoku~.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> You know, you guys are weirdly fixated on Shikoku.<br>
<strong>Karin:</strong> It&#x27;s not that we&#x27;re fixated on it. It&#x27;s just... In our world, Shikoku is all that&#x27;s left.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> What do you mean?<br>
<strong>Sonoko:</strong> In the world that we came from, for the last 300 years, the land outside of Shikoku has been inhospitable to human life.<br>
<strong>Sonoko:</strong> Because of the vertex... The common enemy of humanity in our world.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> If I&#x27;m being honest, I only half believed all this stuff you were saying about another world, but it doesn&#x27;t sound like you&#x27;re messing around here.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Nobody would look so serious saying something like that if it were all a big lie.<br>
<strong>Sonoko:</strong> Thank you... Kaoru-san.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Vertex... They&#x27;re like the aradama are in our world, right? If something goes wrong here, our world could end up like that too...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> That&#x27;s what we toji are here to prevent from happening. We&#x27;re moving out!<br>
<strong>Karin:</strong> HAAAAAA!!<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> Phew, aradama sure are tough. We can&#x27;t use Mankai either...<br>
<strong>Sonoko:</strong> Fuumin-senpai. It seems like we can use Mankai for this~.<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> ...Huh?<br>
<strong>Sonoko:</strong> A little bit ago, when no one was around, I used it myself in secret~.<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> You what!? That&#x27;s too reckless...<br>
<strong>Sonoko:</strong> Don&#x27;t worry, don&#x27;t worry. As you can see, I&#x27;m just fine. The rules for Mankai now seem to be different from both in the past, when there was Sange, and also after it was updated.<br>
<strong>Sonoko:</strong> There are no after-effects from Sange. It also seems like we can use it many times over. The Shinju-sama might be giving us a favor here~.<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> Ehh!? Like an extra special measure...? The Shinju-sama must be going through good times...<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> Well, alright then! Let&#x27;s take full advantage of this favor! We&#x27;re using Mankai, Itsuki!<br>
<strong>Itsuki:</strong> Wait for me, Onee-chan! I&#x27;m going too!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> What is that about... They&#x27;re overwhelmingly more capable than before.<br>
<strong>Sonoko:</strong> That&#x27;s called Mankai. It&#x27;s a Hero&#x27;s ultimate weapon~.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> And, all of you can do that?<br>
<strong>Karin:</strong> Yep. I&#x27;ll show you what a complete Hero&#x27;s Mankai looks like!<br>
<strong>Sonoko:</strong> I&#x27;m going with you~!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Ohh, these guys, they&#x27;re actually pretty strong.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> We&#x27;ve gotta put in our best effort too! Kiyoka, can you watch my back?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Of course, Hono-chan!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I&#x27;m counting on you! HAAAAAAA!!<br>
<strong>Yuuna:</strong> Mihono-chan and Kiyoka-chan, they seem like they&#x27;ll be fine now!<br>
<strong>Tougou:</strong> They sure do. Mihono-chan is taking point, while Kiyoka-chan backs her up.<br>
<strong>Tougou:</strong> They&#x27;re a good match for each other.<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> oooOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Uwah!? Some kind of super strong looking aradama just came out!?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> It&#x27;s daunting compared to the aradama we&#x27;ve faced so far.<br>
<strong>Tougou:</strong> The boss of them all must have shown itself here then.<br>
<strong>Yuuna:</strong> Leave it to me! I&#x27;m using Mankai here!<br>
<strong>Yuuna:</strong> HERO PUUUNCH!<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> GUOOO!<br>
<strong>Tougou:</strong> If you&#x27;re going in, Yuuna-chan, then I&#x27;ll be with you! I&#x27;ll carry out an all out assault on the enemy forces!<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> GUOOooo...!<br>
<strong>Yuuna:</strong> Mihono-chan! Kiyoka-chan! We softened up the aradama!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Okay! Just leave the rest to us!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Let&#x27;s go, Kiyoka!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Right!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> The Heroes have some great teamwork and cooperation, but we&#x27;ll show them the investigation team can do just as good too!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Okay!! Let&#x27;s do it!<br>
<strong>Mihono/Kiyoka:</strong> HAAAAAA-!!<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> OoooOOooo...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> We... We beat it!!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> We did, didn&#x27;t we, Hono-chan!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> It&#x27;s all because you were here with me!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> No, it&#x27;s because you were so strong, Hono-chan!<br>
<strong>Karin:</strong> Look at that, now they&#x27;re as close as can be.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Mmhm, that closeness is a thing of beauty. I want to get in there too!<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> We beat the aradama, and Mihono and Kiyoka safely made up with each other! That&#x27;s the Hero Club&#x27;s work here finished! Good work, everyone!<br>
<strong>Yuuna:</strong> Wh-What was that!?<br>
<strong>Sonoko:</strong> Ah... It seems like, that&#x27;s all for this time.<br>
<strong>Sonoko:</strong> I&#x27;m starting to lose feeling in my body... I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;re being drawn back to our world on the other side.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> You mean, we already have to say goodbye!?<br>
<strong>Tougou:</strong> It seems that way... Though it&#x27;s a shame. Like last time, it&#x27;s so sudden.<br>
<strong>Fuu:</strong> We might not have been together for long, but it was a lot of fun being in this world. Thanks for that.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Wait! I still didn&#x27;t...!<br>
<strong>Yuuna:</strong> See you, everyone...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah... They disappeared...<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Man... They sure were a loud bunch. But with them gone, it&#x27;ll be kind of lonely too.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...I still didn&#x27;t tell them thanks for helping me make up with Kiyoka.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Hono-chan...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> They say that what happens twice will happen thrice. If you want to thank them, you can do it next time you meet.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah, that&#x27;s right, isn&#x27;t it.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah, oh yeah. Since the mission&#x27;s over, does everyone want to go get something to eat?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> That sounds fine. Given the occasion, I think I&#x27;ll join you.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Alright!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> What should we have?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> That&#x27;ll be... Udon, of course!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="6-so-i-never-forget-again"></a>6: So I Never Forget Again<a class="hash-link" href="#6-so-i-never-forget-again" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Sonoko:</strong> YAAAAAAA!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> DEEIIII-!!<br>
<strong>Tougou:</strong> With that, the aradama have been suppressed.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Thanks, Tougou-san, Sonoko! Now we just need to collect up the noro...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Huh, someone&#x27;s calling? It&#x27;s Konohana-san.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Hello, this is Asakura Mihono.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> This is a report from the Special Sword Administration Bureau. After defeating the aradama from this abnormal outbreak, there have been cases of unidentified objects being found along with the noro.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Unidentified objects?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yes. The shape is always a four sided pyramid. As for their size, many of them are larger than a human body.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I&#x27;ll send a photo, so please confirm with those &quot;Heroes&quot; with you if they can shed any light on the subject.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Whoa, what are those... They&#x27;re like pyramids.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Hey, Tougou-san, Sonoko! Do you know anything about these things? It sounds like they&#x27;re coming out of aradama after they get beaten...<br>
<strong>Tougou:</strong> This is.. The soul of a vertex!?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Soul? What do you mean<br>
<strong>Tougou:</strong> For the enemies that appear in our world, the vertex, this is something similar to their heart.<br>
<strong>Sonoko:</strong> If this is coming out of aradama, then does that mean the aradamas out there have been eating up vertex souls~!?<br>
<strong>Tougou:</strong> Mihono-chan, the aradama appearing now may have grown stronger because they&#x27;ve taken in these souls...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Really!?<br>
<strong>Sonoko:</strong> We can&#x27;t prove it, but it sounds likely... The vertex and aradama both have their relation to divinity, so it could be the aradama have what it takes to assimilate it.<br>
<strong>Sonoko:</strong> Either way, we can&#x27;t go leaving those vertex souls here in your world, so we&#x27;ll be bringing them back with us.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Then, did the aradama we just beat have those in them too...?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Wait, this isn&#x27;t one of those pyramids. What is it?<br>
<strong>Sonoko:</strong> Hmm, I haven&#x27;t seen this before, but... I&#x27;m not getting a bad feeling from it, so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s dangerous?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Okay, then I&#x27;m going to try touching it!<br>
<strong>Sonoko:</strong> You really are a &quot;leap before you look!&quot; kind of girl, aren&#x27;t you, Mihocchi~. Just like Yuuyu.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> You mean Yuuna? Well you&#x27;re right, I feel like I could really get along with her!<br>
<strong>Tougou:</strong> Fufu, that&#x27;s true. You two are very much alike, so I&#x27;m sure you would get along.<br>
<strong>Tougou:</strong> But, the closest one to Yuuna-chan will always be me.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Uhh, your voice got all serious all of a sudden...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Anyway, I&#x27;m going to try touching the weird object!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Eh... Huh?<br>
<strong>Tougou:</strong> What is it?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah... It&#x27;s like... I remembered. When we were in that Jukai place, all of us fighting along with the Heroes... Huh? Why did I forget about that, anyway?<br>
<strong>Sonoko:</strong> After touching the strange object that came from the aradama, your memories came back...? Here, let me see that for a minute~.<br>
<strong>Sonoko:</strong> Ah. There&#x27;s a message, on the Hero app on our phones... &quot;Sensing a spiritual power&quot;?<br>
<strong>Sonoko:</strong> ...Hmmmm, if the app is reacting to it, then maybe this could be, a piece of the Shinju-sama&#x27;s power~?<br>
<strong>Tougou:</strong> Then, when Mihono-chan came in contact with the Shinju-sama&#x27;s power, her memories of us returned?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> If that&#x27;s what happened... Then, so long as we have these, we won&#x27;t forget all of you!?<br>
<strong>Sonoko:</strong> Mmm~, I&#x27;d say there&#x27;s a chance at least. We don&#x27;t know how long the Shinju-sama&#x27;s influence will go on for, so unless we collect a lot of them, it might not work.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Okay-, then I&#x27;m going to collect a whole bunch! I&#x27;ll beat all the aradama, and get them all! Where there&#x27;s a will, there&#x27;s a way!<br>
<strong>Tougou:</strong> We&#x27;ll give you assistance. We only just managed to meet again, so it would be too sad for you to forget.<br>
<strong>Sonoko:</strong> I&#x27;ll help too~!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Thanks a lot! Let&#x27;s go and beat up the next group of aradama right away!</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations/edit/docs/Okatana_with_Flowers_Shining_in_Full_Bloom_Chapter.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_2_ui" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_3DPF"></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"></div></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_35-E thin-scrollbar"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#1-a-grudge-over-food-is-a-fearsome-thing" class="table-of-contents__link">1: A Grudge Over Food is a Fearsome Thing!</a></li><li><a href="#2-heroes-once-more" class="table-of-contents__link">2: Heroes Once More</a></li><li><a href="#3-hero-club-emergency-activity" class="table-of-contents__link">3: Hero Club Emergency Activity!</a></li><li><a href="#4-kiyokas-feelings" class="table-of-contents__link">4: Kiyoka&#39;s Feelings</a></li><li><a href="#5-mankai" class="table-of-contents__link">5: Mankai</a></li><li><a href="#6-so-i-never-forget-again" class="table-of-contents__link">6: So I Never Forget Again</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Links</div><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://pastebin.com/LdyviZ8Z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Translator anon&#x27;s pastebin<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Site source code<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Built with Docusaurus.</div></div></div></footer></div>
