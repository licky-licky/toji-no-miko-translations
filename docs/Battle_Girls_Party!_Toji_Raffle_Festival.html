I'm sure it'll be a lot of fun!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> I agree, Kaoru-san.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> On top of that, there are lots of middle school girls grouped with us, so as their onee-sans, it's our duty to guide them.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> We can be Team Osafune Onee-sans!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Pass. Unlike you two, I'm not onee-san material.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Don't be silly. You'd make a fine onee-san, Kaoru-san.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Even if I act all like "I'm your onee-san, teehee"... Look at me?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> I don't have those fine persuasive qualities like you do to pull it off.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Persuasive qualities... Just where do you think you're looking?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Hey, that reaction... You're self-conscious about it?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Kaoru-san!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> ...Well if you don't like it, then that's that. We can be Team Osafune Mashiko instead!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> That's even worse!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> And why's that?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> The name makes it sound like I'm in charge. That's way too much work.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Now then, let's start the meeting. Our members are...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Mm, everyone's here.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Our group is in charge of the entertainment for the recognition party.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Konohana-san, who's leading the committee, said to come up with something that could "satisfactorily conclude the year".<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I want to make a bigger attraction than the main event! We can't lose to Hanahana!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> How're we supposed to stand out more than the main event though?<br><strong>Hashi Keiko:</strong> (H-Huh? Why does it seem like everyone already knows each other?)<br><strong>Keiko:</strong> (I'm being left out... I can't join the conversation... It's too much for an outsider like me...)<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Wait wait, stooop!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Nn? What's up, Mihono? If you have to go to the bathroom, hurry it up.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> That's okay, I already went before the meeting!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> But what I mean is, shouldn't we all introduce ourselves first? Hashi-san looks really lost.ã€€  
<strong>Keiko:</strong> (I might as well not be here... I have to get back to my monkey wrench and...)<br><strong>Keiko:</strong> Wh-Why is everyone looking at me!? D-Did you want me to come up with something!?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Fufu, you're always watching out for others, Mihono-chan. Since we toji all know each other, we went straight into the meeting, didn't we?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Nice thinking, Mihomiho! Let's introduce ourselves! I'm Kohagura Ellen, from Osafune Girls' Academy!<br><strong>Keiko:</strong> Ah... Hello, nice to meet you. I'm Hashi Keiko, taking preparatory courses in engineering at Ayanokouji Martial Arts School...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> I'll go next. I'm from Osafune Girls' Academy...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Now that we all know each other, we can start the meeting properly. If you want to make any suggestions, don't hesitate to tell us, okay, Hashi-san?<br><strong>Keiko:</strong> Y-Yes, I will. I'll try... But if I don't have much to say, I'm sorry...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> You're funny, Hajihaji!<br><strong>Keiko:</strong> Th-Thank you...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Setouchi-san, for the entertainment... Could we do something like the official tournament?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Oi oi, do you have any idea how many toji there are in the Five Traditions?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Enough to let us have plenty of matches with all kinds of toji!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> That certainly would feel like a conclusion to the year, but... Wouldn't it be hard to organize? Maybe we should think of something more simple...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Hmm, that's too bad then!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> It has to be fun and entertaining, while also concluding the year...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> It's difficult, isn't it, Mihono-chan.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I feel like smoke's gonna start coming out of my ears~! I wanna eat something sweet!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Ah, in that case, I have these sakura macarons. Want one?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Of course! Thanks, Mai!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Oh, I want one too! Mmm~, macarons are so good!<br><strong>Keiko:</strong> Um, Yanase-san, those macarons... Nevermind.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I have plenty to go around, so don't worry. Here you go, Hashi-san.<br><strong>Keiko:</strong> Thank you very much. ...Ah, it's good.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Right? Mai's really good at cooking!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> She can make cookies and all kinds of stuff, and they're all super tasty.<br><strong>Keiko:</strong> Not only are you a toji, but you're also good at cooking... You're amazing, Yanase-san...!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I-It's not that amazing~.<br><strong>Keiko:</strong> ...This is so good that, maybe, we could make everyone compete for Yanase-san's cooking...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Now there's an eccentric idea.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> But it sounds like fun too!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> We could set up a lot of prizes and a raffle, and start a battle royale!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> What if we gave every toji a raffle ticket, and they had to try and take each other's while protecting their own...?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> We could call it a raffle competition!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> That's taking it pretty literally.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> You don't get it, Kaoru! That's what's great about it!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Does anyone have any objections...?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> It isn't really an objection, but... How are students that aren't toji meant to participate?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Ah, you're right, we didn't think of that...<br><strong>Keiko:</strong> Um, in that case... What if we gave the average number of raffle tickets the executive committee gets to all the non-toji students?<br><strong>Keiko:</strong> That way, you can join in supporting someone and have fun even if you're not fighting... Would that work?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> I like the sound of that! Thank you, Hashi-san!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> We'll go with that then. The entertainment at the recognition party will be a raffle competition!  </p><h2 id="2-what-do-we-want" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>2: What Do We Want?</h2><p><strong>Suzuka:</strong> A... Raffle competition?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Yes. We give raffle tickets to all the toji, and they compete over them for fun.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> While acting as a conclusion to the year, it also sounds entertaining... I like it.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Very well. This year, we will carry out a raffle competition.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Okay, thank you!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> With that settled, next we need to think of what prizes will be in the raffle. Have you come up with a list?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Ah, not yet, we'll be deciding on the prizes in our next meeting.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Then this works out nicely. Please include dresses as prizes.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Now then, let's think up what to put in the raffle!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> We have to include dresses?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Yes. Konohana-san said, since we're having a big party, suggestions like that would be interesting.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Dresses, huh... Wouldn't it be hard working up the courage to wear a dress while everyone's in uniform, Kanami?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I know, Mihono-chan. I think it'd be hard to move around in too.<br><strong>Keiko:</strong> (The conversation is getting off-topic... But it'd be better not to interrupt them...)<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Can we put whatever we want in the raffle, Chie?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Mmhm, anything within common sense.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> ......Time off.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Eh? What was that, Kaoru-chan?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...I want time off.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> "Time off", there.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> That'll work!?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> It'll be more fun if there's all kinds of prizes in there. Feel free to come up with suggestions like Kaoru-san did, everyone.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I'd like an all-you-can-eat dessert buffet!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Or what about a free pass for the cafeteria?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> It's a big occasion, so let's put in both! The more you can win, the better it gets!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> "Dessert buffet", "Cafeteria pass". Did you come up with anything, Etou-san, Yanase-san?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Would a swordfight ticket work? You can use it to have a match with anyone you want.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I thought you'd go with something like that, Kanami-chan.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> In my case... Why not an increase to club funding, or a chance to spend a day with the elite guard?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> "Swordfight ticket", "Club funding", "Spend a day with the elite guard"...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> What about you, Hajihaji?<br><strong>Keiko:</strong> Me!?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> You don't have to think too hard about it. Just say whatever you want to do.<br><strong>Keiko:</strong> What I want to do... Then, servicing the Storm Armor, but with my skills...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Worrying about it won't get you anywhere, Hajihaji. If you do screw something up, you can use that experience next time. It's no problem.<br><strong>Keiko:</strong> N-No problem? B-But, if I screw up, then the consequences...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Then, let's think about how to get you some help with that!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> What's important is a helper for your preparatory classes, right? Then you need someone to support you... We need to recruit people in advance.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> And, when it comes to servicing... If nothing's wrong, you'll want to see a practical test of it. So we need to have toji ready too...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Ah, but, there's a chance someone from the engineering courses won't draw that prize. We have to make sure it works in case a toji draws it... Is there anything else we should consider?<br><strong>Keiko:</strong> N-No, if I have someone helping me, I think I should be fine.<br><strong>Keiko:</strong> But... I-Is this really okay?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> As a preparatory engineering student, this would be a great experience for you, wouldn't it?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> That's why I'm glad to have your point of view. Thank you, Hashi-san.<br><strong>Keiko:</strong> Y-You don't need to thank me for anything...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> See, most of us here are toji, aren't we?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> So, even if we try, it's hard to represent students from other departments. But we should think of prizes that everyone from the Five Traditions can have fun with!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I see you took into account students from all departments. These prizes should do fine.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I'll make an announcement summarizing the raffle competition to the Five Traditions.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> We don't have to do anything to help with that, right?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Not at all. You're doing more than enough by preparing the party's entertainment.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...I'm curious, why did you come this time in place of Setouchi-san?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...I'm just that serious about this project. I want to make sure it's a success, no matter what.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> How reliable of you. You've been a great help, Mashiko-san.  </p><h2 id="3-hashi-vanished" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>3: Hashi Vanished</h2><p><strong>Toji A:</strong> Hey, did you see what they're doing for the recognition party's entertainment?<br><strong>Toji B:</strong> I did! A raffle competition, right? I want that all-you-can-eat dessert buffet!<br><strong>Toji A:</strong> I'm more interested in spending a day with the elite guard. You could get to work with Shidou-san!<br><strong>Toji B:</strong> Better collect all the raffle tickets you can! Things are gonna get serious when it starts, you know?<br><strong>Toji A:</strong> Same goes for you!<br><strong>Keiko:</strong> Uuu... People are already talking about the raffle competition.<br><strong>Keiko:</strong> I'm happy about getting to service Storm Armor, but... Can someone like me really handle that...<br><strong>Keiko:</strong> The nervousness is making my stomach hurt... Maintenance... It doesn't matter what, I have to do maintenance on something...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Let's start today's work on preparing for the raffle competition!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Oh, hold up, Mihono-chan. I don't think Hashi-san's here yet.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Hashi-san's never been late before... Setouchi-san, did she tell you anything?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> I haven't heard from her. Maybe we should send someone to look for her?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Sure thing! I'm on it!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Thank you, Ellen-san. I think it would help if we sent at least one more person though...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Pass. I'll be here to fill in Ellen's share while she's gone.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> What're you working so hard for, Kaoru?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> I'm trying to rack up enough good karma to win that time off.<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Ne-!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> That explains it. In that case, I'll go with Ellen-chan.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Hi! Let's go, Kanamin!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Hajihaji's not here, Kanamin. Where could she have gone?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I know she was here after school ended.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Somebody said she was walking around looking all dizzy.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Walking around all dizzy... That sounds like trouble! Hajihaji must be in the infirmary or the dorms!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I'll check the infirmary! You go see her dorm room, Kanamin!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Okay!<br><strong>Keiko:</strong> Ughh....<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Hashi-san, are you in there? Huh, the door's unlocked... I'm coming in.<br><strong>Keiko:</strong> ...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Oh, there you are... Hey, are you okay!? You're as pale as a ghost!?<br><strong>Keiko:</strong> Why is Etou-san here...?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I came because we were worried about you!<br><strong>Keiko:</strong> I made Etou-san and the others worry about me... My life is over...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> It's still going on though!?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Hold on, I have to message Ellen-chan real quick!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> ...So basically, you wanted to do maintenance on Storm Armor so badly that it made you nervous, so you hardly slept in order to study servicing it?<br><strong>Keiko:</strong> ...Yes. I can't fall asleep unless I've done some maintenance...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Have you been up all this time? You're working yourself too hard, Hajihaji.<br><strong>Keiko:</strong> But I'm nervous... I have to distract myself with some maintenance...<br><strong>Keiko:</strong> Pliers are the best... Screws are cute... My heaven is here...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Oh! Hajihaji has a metal fetish.<br><strong>Keiko:</strong> That's not it...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Anyway, you have to relax, Hashi-san. Maybe Setouchi-san will have some advice to help you?<br><strong>Keiko:</strong> Even though I'm causing you so much trouble... Thank you so much. You must be goddess, Etou-san...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I'm not though!?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> And that's how Kanamin became goddess!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Haha-! Goddess Kanami-sama!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I said I'm not!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Etou-san. What did Hashi-san have to say?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Oh, yeah. If it's possible, she wants to focus on some kind of behind the scenes work that lets her use tools.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Okay, then let's let her do that. And also, we'll try to give her free time to practice maintenance in, okay?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> That's a good idea, Chii-nee! I'll go tell Hashi-san!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah, wait up, Mihono-chan! I'll go too!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> And they're gone. Did you want to go too, Mai?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I do, but... It's best not to surround her with too many people when she's not feeling well.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Okay. Then, we'll have to work extra hard to make up for them while they're gone.<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Ne-!  </p><h2 id="4-kaorus-plan" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>4: Kaoru's Plan</h2><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> Huh!?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> What happened, Mihono? Did you forget something?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I didn't, but... Uhh, right now, I was going over the orders for the amount of prizes, and...<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Nene-?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> The order for the dresses... There's enough dresses for all of the students.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Huh!? Oi! Who's the one that ordered the dresses!?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> No, call up the supplier before anything...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Oh, that's not a mistake. Konohana-san placed the order for the dresses, so it's alright.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...The elite guard are something else.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Apparently, that's what happened, Chie. It's weird to see Kaoru acting like such a leader.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Did Team Onee-sans get to her after all?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I don't really know. It's not like she's guaranteed to get the time off if she works harder...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> But, I do think it's good she's getting so involved!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> I agree. We have to follow the example she's setting!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Of course! Whether it's the preparation or the main event, let's make it as fun as we can!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...Nene. I'm trying hard at getting things set up, right?<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Nene-!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> And everyone can tell, right?<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Ne-!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Then... Everything should be ready. If the time off won't come to me... I've gotta go to it.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Hey, Mihono... You got a minute?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> What's up, Kaoru-san?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> I wanted to ask you something... If, during the raffle competition, you get the time off... Could you give it to me?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Of course, if there's something else you wanted, I'll give it to you if I get it. All I want is that time off.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> So... Please!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> You've been working so hard getting things ready, Kaoru-san... So sure!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> If I get the time off, I'll give it to you!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> (...Just as planned!)<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> And Chie and Mai agreed. Too easy. Ah! Heyyy, Ellen!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Kaoru-! What is it?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> If you get the time off from the raffle competition, give it to me.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> ...Oh, so that's what you've been up to. This is why you were helping so much with the preparations, right?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> You planned to show everyone how hard you were working, making it easier to convince them to give you their time off!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Sure did. Got a problem with it? I'm not taking any chances with that time off.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> It's not like it's guaranteed, but... With seven people, one of them is bound to get it.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Somehow, I'm relieved to see you acting more like yourself! How about this... If you get the all-you-can-eat dessert buffet, then it's win-win for both of us, right?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> No problem. Is that negotiations settled?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I think so. So then, who are you going to ask next?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Kanami... Wait, are you coming too?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Yes! It sounds like fun, so I'll join you!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Time off? Sure!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Thanks, Kanami.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> In exchange, I'd be happy if you had a sparring session with me!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Well, that's about what I expected. I don't really want to, but... If that's what it takes.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Then, let's go right now!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...Huh? Are you serious!?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> We have plenty spare time, so we can fight all we want, Kaoru-chan!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> ...Kanamin loves a good fight after all! Ooh, I thought up something good... Now I'm looking forward to the main event!  </p><h2 id="5-the-raffle-competition-begins" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>5: The Raffle Competition Begins!</h2><p>On the day of the End of the School Year Recognition Party--</p><p><strong>Suzuka:</strong> With that, we will now begin the raffle competition.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> To start, as members of the executive committee, Setouchi-san, Hashi-san, and I will be overseeing the competition.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Sorry, Hashi-san, for making you do so much committee work.<br><strong>Keiko:</strong> N-No, it's fine...

What do you want?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> A hachimanriki surprise attack!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> -! Kongoushin!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Oh! Nicely blocked, Kaoru!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Don't give me that. The hell are you doing, attacking me out of nowhere?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Isn't it obvious... Kaoru, let's fight!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Ugh... No way!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Why should I fight you! We don't get anything out of fighting other committee members!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Kanamin's request for you gave me an idea...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> A fight between best friends, with the raffle tickets on the line... Doesn't it get you fired up!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> That's your reason!?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> That's all the reason I need!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> And of course, if you don't fight me, forget about me giving you that time off!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> That's playing dirty!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> That's a compliment to me!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> We've got committee work to do too, so I wanted to get as much as I could now... You better not regret this later!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> That's it! That's what I was looking for! Now you're getting into it!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Tch!

Kaoru-? Where'd you go, Kaoru... Wah!?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> I saw my chance and took it.

They're working the committee to death...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Don't worry about it, Kaoru! Even if you don't have a whole lot, I'm sure you'll still pull something good!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Hey, don't act like this isn't your fault. Who's the one who held me up right at the start?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> But wasn't it a lot of fun, fighting each other seriously?<br><strong>Keiko:</strong> U-Um... Was it alright for me to receive a dress too?<br><strong>Keiko:</strong> I didn't draw a dress from the raffle...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Kanami said it was fine, so there's nothing to worry about.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> But still, you had some crazy luck with your draws.<br><strong>Keiko:</strong> I can use the cafeteria ticket, though I don't know what to do with the club funding and day with the elite guard.<br><strong>Keiko:</strong> And... I'm sure I used up all my life's luck here...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> You still have plenty more luck ahead of you, Hajihaji!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Speaking of which, is Kanamin still not done with the raffle?<br><strong>Keiko:</strong> Ah, yes, she was halfway finished with all her draws when I last saw her.<br><strong>Keiko:</strong> I want to thank Etou-san for the dress, but... I don't think I can do it just yet.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> And, from the half she got, most of them were dresses. It's pretty crazy how many of them are in there.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Kanami could totally open a dress store after this!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> What did you get from the raffle, Mihono-chan?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Listen to this, Mai~. Things were going good at first, but the second half of my draws were a total bust~.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> And whenever I won something from the raffle, it was all dresses too... How'd you do, Mai?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Actually... I won the all-you-can-eat desserts!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I'm so jealous, Maimai!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...So Mai didn't get the time off either.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I'm back.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Hey, Kanami! Here, I got a drink for you!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Thanks, Mihono-chan. ...Phew, that hits the spot.<br><strong>Keiko:</strong> U-Um, Etou-san, this dress, thank you for giving it to me...!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Don't mention it. I got the swordfight ticket, so I'm feeling generous!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ooh! Congrats, Kanami!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...I was betting on Kanami to get the time off, but that didn't work out either...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Guess I really have to do it myself.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> So you're finally taking your shot, Kaoru...!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Yeah... I only have this one ticket, but... I'll bet everything on it!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Oh, Kaoru-san. Are you here to try your luck?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Hope it hasn't been too hard working the raffle. Did anybody get the time off yet?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Don't worry, it's still in there. Go on, give it a draw, Kaoru-san.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Ahh... It must be my fate to pull it now.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...Hah!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Congratulations, Kaoru-san! You won the opportunity to monitor the Storm Armor test!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Monitoring... Am I gonna have to do this on top of my normal missions...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> How'd it go, Kaoru?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> For now... I'm just going to eat.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Uh oh, it can't be good news then. Kaoru, maybe changing into your dress will make you feel better~.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> I didn't get a dress.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> That's alright! I thought you might not, so I asked Kanamin for one!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Sigh, I can't do this. If I don't eat, I can't do this.<br><strong>Sana:</strong> Are you having a good time?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Geh, it's the ha... the president.<br><strong>Sana:</strong> What was that you almost called me just now?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Y-You're just hearing things?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> A-Anyway, it's alright. The food's pretty good at this party.<br><strong>Sana:</strong> Good, eat up then. Tomorrow, you've got work to do in Kyushu.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Huh?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> There you go again, Kaoru! You're so loved by your job!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Is that supposed to make me feel better-!? Bring me another plate-!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah, I can go get that.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Great, thanks.<br><strong>Keiko:</strong> ...Um, did your raffle not go well?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Yeah, I got Storm Armor monitoring duty.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> I work my ass off getting the raffle competition ready, and all I get is work in Kyushu and with Storm Armor! If I don't eat my fill here, I can't go on like this!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Nice thinking, Kaoru!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> You have to makes sure the Storm Armor Hajihaji does maintenance on gets a good testing!<br><strong>Keiko:</strong> R-Right! I'm glad it's going to be someone I know helping me!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> There's nothing nice about this.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> If everybody did the raffle and nobody got the time off, then we should've worked on the rates some more!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> But this just means there's jobs that need your help! Right, Mai?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> That's true; you must have a higher calling, Kaoru-san.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> And I'm not happy about it!
