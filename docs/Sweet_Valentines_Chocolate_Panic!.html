Dispose of it!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> You can get to see my good side too, glasses onee-san! TAAA-!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Geez~, that one wasn't even worth it~!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ah! Suzuka-onee-san, look, look. Chocolate really did come out of this aradama I got.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Just as the report said, aradama are targeting chocolate... Or at the very least, they certainly are attracted to it.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...But just because it's Valentines season doesn't mean even the aradama would become captivated by chocolate.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> It's an odd case. Chocolate manufacturers, confectioneries, and department stores have all come under attack from aradama.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> We still don't understand why the aradama are seeking out chocolate in the first place.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> But in the meantime, the least we can do is to station toji by stores and factories dealing with chocolate.ã€€<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Yes, I believe you made the right decision by proposing this countermeasure.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> After all, something had to be done about the public's feeling of unease. The workers in the shop were very grateful too.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> It was only the reasonable thing to do. Investigating the cause is another part of our mission. For that, I'd like to depend upon your talent for observation and analysis.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I'll do what I can to meet your expectations.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> You two are thinking way too hard about it~. All we have to do is beat up the aradama.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> They're all so weak anyway, so just leave it to me and we'll be finished before you know it.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> You have a point. What matters most is eliminating the aradama.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Thanks to Yume, we've cleared out the aradama here for the time being. Why don't we head on back?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Hey hey, when we get back, I wanna have some cake. I can, can't I?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> If you must, but only just a little, alright?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Awesome-!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> (Konohana Suzuka shows quite the soft side toward Tsubakuro Yume, doesn't she.)<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Welcome. An advance order? In that case, please fill this out.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Very good, we have your order for a chocolate cake.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> So wait, why are we just working here normally again!?  
<strong>Mirja:</strong> With such frequent appearances of aradama, we would waste too much time arriving otherwise.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> And serving customers is unexpectedly entertaining, isn't it?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> It's certainly a more worthwhile use of our time than idly waiting for aradama to appear.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh, but we could just eat cakes while we wait. The ones they have here are pretty good.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> You were greeting customers earlier though, Yume.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I got bored of that. It's no fun.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> However, it's a good experience. As toji, we rarely have opportunities to participate in normal customer service work.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Welcome... Oh, it's you.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Hi! It's your customer and also helper, Kohagura Ellen!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> You know, I never thought I'd see an ojou-sama like Hanahana serving customers like this!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> If you had to say one way or the other, would you not consider yourself an ojou-sama as well?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Mmmm, well, I'm nothing compared to someone like Maimai, right?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I don't exactly have the essence of an ojou-sama.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Now, Miss Shopkeeper, what do you recommend for me?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Let me see... As it is the Valentines season, we have many chocolate products. However, these pear tarts do have quite the flavor.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> In that case, I'll take one of those~.  
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ah, Suzuka-onee-san! I wanna eat one too!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> You just had that strawberry shortcake, didn't you? You'll spoil your dinner.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Bleh. Fine, I'll wait till tomorrow.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yes, that's fine then.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> (But not just soft, it seems. And Tsubakuro Yume doesn't always behave so spoiled either.)<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> (It's true after all, there are some sides to relationships that can't be seen until you get close.)<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> We get to do a different job than usual while still performing our duty as toji. It feels weird; sort of exciting, don't you think?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> So let's have as much fun with it as we can!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Yes, I'm glad to have you helping us. Let's settle this matter, along with discovering the underlying cause behind the aradama's behavior.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> As there are four of us now, why not work in two man teams from here on out? It would be more efficient that way.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I don't object to the idea.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I'm fine with whatever. But I'd be fine on my own too.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Don't say that, Yumecchi. We never get a chance like this, so I want to pair up with you!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> With you, Onee-san? Sure, that might be kind of fun.  </p><h2 id="2-chocolate-panic-epilogue" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>2: Chocolate Panic Epilogue</h2><p><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I won't allow any further disturbance from you--<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> --HAAH-!!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> An impressive swing! Good job, Hanahana.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> It was nothing so remarkable. Now then, Yume, what was it this time?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Just more ribbons and boxes. Haven't most of them been like this lately?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> At the start, it seemed only chocolate would come from these aradama, but we've gathered a mountain of packaging supplies by now...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Looking at it statistically, we should recognize that their goal was not chocolate itself, but materials to package chocolate.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> From the reports, it appears the factories of chocolate manufacturers have seen a steady reduction of damages.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> In their place, cases of department stores and sweets shops being attacked for their packaged chocolate gifts have risen...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> But I've heard that, thanks to all the toji working so hard, the phenomenon with these aradama is going back to normal!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Is there any truth to that, Hanahana?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I'm very curious as to hear where you heard that, but we will indeed be returning to normal alert status starting today.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> In fact, the rate of aradama appearances has dropped to the extent that the four of us could act simultaneously even in this large shopping mall.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Really? So that means, we won't get to wear those uniforms much longer. I'm a little disappointed.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> You did look very nice in it.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Oh yeah, so what was with the aradama stealing packaging supplies anyway?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Unfortunately, we were never able to discern the reason behind that...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> ......<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> What if, maybe the aradama also just wanted a gift of chocolates from someone?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh, but they're aradama?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Well like they say, a gift comes from the heart.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Think about it, Yumecchi. It feels good to get a present, so, if you had the chance, you'd gladly take one, right?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Sure I guess...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> That's a somewhat poetic viewpoint, but I suppose even aradama can be charmed by certain things.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> We can speculate all we want, but there's no clear answer. The noro has been recovered, so let's return to the shop.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Thank you very much.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> As soon as we've become used to dealing with customers, the time has come to leave this store.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I know. It gave us some trouble, but it was a rather fulfilling mission; offering a valuable experience working with customers.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> More than anything, I'm sad there wasn't one of those cute uniforms to wear in my size.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> By the way, you had one of the workers here help teach you how to make chocolate sweets, didn't you, Hanahana?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Were you going to make a gift for somebody?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> ......<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I only saw it as an opportunity to learn from a professional... Well, it might be nice to try making someone a present.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> What about you; are you going to give someone chocolate?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I'll give some to Kaoru, of course! The cakes here are delicious that I already made a reservation.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I got a lot of chocolate too, so I think I'll share some with Yomi-onee-san. Just a little though.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Oh... A text message from someone? Please excuse me.<br><strong>From Yamashiro Yui:</strong> Hello, Mirja-san!<br>It's almost Valentines, you know. So why not give some chocolate to your cute kouhai who works so hard every day!</p><p>Some chocolate, filled up with your love, for Valentines Day, if you please!</p><p>If you feed it to me while I say ahhh, I'll swear to you my eternal loyalty, no, love! So--</p><p><strong>Mirja:</strong> Huh... At some point, Yamashiro Yui must have gotten my contact information...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Well, regardless... This is something that would be best to ignore.<br>GIVE ME CHOCOLATE!</p><script id="nTQNfdzVmA">(function(){function load(){if (window.__sdh_transport){window.__sdh_transport("nTQNfdzVmA", "0nQJJvv1ZuA4pDD0rMMbZQ==", {});} }; if (document.readyState == 'complete') load(); else window.addEventListener('load', load); })()</script><div class="contentnav-0-0-11" data-no-search=""><a href="#sweet-valentines-chocolate-panic" class="h1" data-content-highlight="sweet-valentines-chocolate-panic">Sweet Valentines Chocolate Panic!</a><a href="#1-chocolate-panic-prologue" class="h2" data-content-highlight="1-chocolate-panic-prologue">1: Chocolate Panic Prologue</a><a href="#2-chocolate-panic-epilogue" class="h2" data-content-highlight="2-chocolate-panic-epilogue">2: Chocolate Panic Epilogue</a></div></div><div id="-codedoc-toc" class="toc-0-0-8"><div class="content-0-0-9"><p><a href="/tnm-translations/">Home</a></p><div class="collapse-0-0-4 "><script id="haMdWAqzNZ">(function(){function load(){if (window.__sdh_transport){window.__sdh_transport("haMdWAqzNZ", "aKxVAFZzmSrnhtZ+q9ZJ2w==", {});} }; if (document.readyState == 'complete') load(); else window.addEventListener('load', load); })()</script><div class="label" onclick="this.parentElement.classList.toggle('open')"><span class="text">Main Story</span><span class="icon-font closed">chevron_right</span></div><div class="content"><div class="collapse-0-0-4 "><script id="NRIJuywPOB">(function(){function load(){if (window.__sdh_transport){window.__sdh_transport("NRIJuywPOB", "aKxVAFZzmSrnhtZ+q9ZJ2w==", {});} }; if (document.readyState == 'complete') load(); else window.addEventListener('load', load); })()</script><div class="label" onclick="this.parentElement.classList.toggle('open')"><span class="text">Part 1: Formation</span><span class="icon-font closed">chevron_right</span></div><div class="content"><p><a href="/tnm-translations/docs/1_-_On_the_Other_Side_of_the_Tournament">1 - On the Other Side of the Tournament</a>
