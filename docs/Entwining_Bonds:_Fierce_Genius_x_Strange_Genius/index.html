I can&#x27;t wait~! When it gets to be night, let&#x27;s play cards! And also, I brought othello too.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Tsubakuro-san, we aren&#x27;t going here to enjoy ourselves. Why not focus on completing our mission here first?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Yomi&#x27;s right. Today we&#x27;re on a joint assignment with other toji. As the elite guard, we need to always keep in mind that we set an example for the others...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Though, with this many of us here, we should be able to settle this quickly.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Yeah, and since I&#x27;m here, it&#x27;ll be over right away. And besides, the other girls look like they&#x27;re having fun too.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Sayaka-chan, that bento was delicious, wasn&#x27;t it? Would you like to have something sweet for dessert too? I baked cookies, just for today.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Wow, there&#x27;s so many.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Since I heard there would be lots of us on this overnight trip, I rolled up my sleeves making them, but maybe it was too much.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> No, I&#x27;m glad there&#x27;s so many.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Ufufu, thank you. Would everyone from the elite guard like some too?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Can I? Thanks. If she&#x27;s offering, we should just have snacktime with them! I&#x27;ll work extra hard after we get there, so we can do it, can&#x27;t we?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I don&#x27;t see why not; we should be building up our stamina right now...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> This is Shidou Maki. Did something come up?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> What!? Understood. We&#x27;ll deal with it at once.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Maki-san? What&#x27;s the matter?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> It sounds like there&#x27;s been a large outbreak of aradama in the mountain forests here. Every moment counts, so we should get off the train here and deal with that first.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> But, if everyone gets off here, won&#x27;t we be too late to complete our primary duty with this expedition?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Right, and HQ has a proposal for that. From here, we&#x27;ll organize into two groups and carry out our missions separately.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Yume, along with Itomi Sayaka, the two of you will stay on this train to our original objective and start on the mission.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> The rest of us will get off the train now and hurry to the scene.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yume and Itomi-san? Those two are being sent alone to the mission point?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Shidou-san, would it be alright for me to to be with Sayaka-chan? Sending the two of them alone is just a little...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I&#x27;m little unsure about it myself, but HQ named them directly, so they must have something in mind. Yume, Itomi Sayaka, what do you think?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Cause I&#x27;m so strong, it&#x27;ll be easy peasy even if I do it by myself~. You can go with them, Sayaka-chan.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> I can be fine if I do it by myself too. I&#x27;ll defeat the aradama quickly, then meet up with you.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Nngh~, well I can beat them in a second, and then I&#x27;ll meet up with you onee-sans faster than Sayaka-chan can!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Sigh... Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t seem they have any intention of working together to defeat them.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> It&#x27;s not helping my concerns, but, with each of their skills, they should be able to manage.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> We appear to have reached our stop. Everyone, let&#x27;s go. Tsubakuro-san, I wish you luck.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Sayaka-chan, will you really be alright without me?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm. I can do my best if I have your cookies.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Sayaka-chan! In that case, take them all with you! Here! And here! And this batch too!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...It&#x27;s heavy. But, thank you for all of them. I&#x27;ll work hard.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Of course! Do your best, Sayaka-chan.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> You too, Yume. Try to get along with Itomi-san.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> They&#x27;re gone now.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm...<br>
<strong>Yume/Sayaka:</strong> ....................................<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> WAHH-! If we just stay quiet this whole time, I&#x27;ll get so bored I&#x27;ll die!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I know! I came up with something good. Sayaka-chan, since it&#x27;s just us two, wanna have a competition?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> A competition?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Yeah. A competition to see who can beat the most aradama! I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ll win, but it&#x27;ll still be fun, won&#x27;t it?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...Okay, but, I probably won&#x27;t lose.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="2-yume-and-sayakas-showdown-begins"></a>2: Yume and Sayaka&#x27;s Showdown Begins!<a class="hash-link" href="#2-yume-and-sayakas-showdown-begins" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Aradama:</strong> GUOOOOO...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Kyahaha, a whole bunch came out! Anyway, Sayaka-chan, our competition&#x27;s starting! EIIIII--!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> I won&#x27;t... lose either...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Not bad, Sayaka-chan! I think I should start getting serious soon too! YAAAAAHH!<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> Keeeee...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Huh? Is it over already?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> It looks like it...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ahaha, they were so weak-! Hey, hey, how many did you beat, Sayaka-chan?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> I think I got about fifty...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> No way-! That&#x27;s how many I got! Boo~, so it&#x27;s a draw then, huhh. But, for sure next time, I&#x27;m not gonna lose!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm... I won&#x27;t lose either.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Hello, Maki-onee-san? It was easy as pie over here, you know? ...Yeah, I got it. We&#x27;ll go ahead.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Shidou Maki? What did she want?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> It&#x27;s about our rooms at the ryokan. The elite guard got a Japanese style room, and everyone else got a Western style room, so she said to go ahead and wait there for them.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Are Mai and the others not here yet? This room is... too big by myself...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Are those onee-sans still not hereee? I got the cards and othello board all set up, but this is boring-.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mai, she&#x27;s still not here. But, we promised... We&#x27;d go in the hot springs together...<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mai&#x27;s calling. Hello?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Sayaka-chan, I&#x27;m sorry. We safely finished eliminating the aradama, but we didn&#x27;t make it in time for the last bus, so we won&#x27;t be able to make it back there tonight.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Eh...?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I&#x27;m sorry about this. I know you&#x27;ll be lonely by yourself, but just rest up in preparation for tomorrow, okay?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> I understand. Okay... Then, bye.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> I&#x27;m alone until morning...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Hello, Maki-onee-san? Huh? Stop calling over and over? But, it&#x27;s so boring being by myself.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> If you&#x27;re bored, then why not play with Itomi Sayaka? Don&#x27;t you think she&#x27;s bored by herself too?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I can&#x27;t do that, because we promised we&#x27;d settle things tomorrow morning. If we start getting along, then it won&#x27;t be a competition!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Hey, if you&#x27;re busy, Maki-onee-san, then what about Yomi-onee-san or Suzuka-onee-san? I don&#x27;t care which one, so let me talk to them, okay-?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> She handed the phone to me. Tsubakuro-san, I remembered hearing a very interesting rumor about the inn we booked...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Eh-, like what, like what? Is it a funny story? I wanna know~! Tell me!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> As the rumor goes, a ghost is said to appear in the inn you&#x27;re staying at. Have you seen it yet?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> EHH---!? What do you mean? Nobody said anything like that to me! Where is it? Where&#x27;s it supposed to come out!?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Ah, I&#x27;m sorry, I&#x27;m being called for something, so you&#x27;ll have to excuse me. Anyway, have a nice night, Tsubakuro-san...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> EHHHHH-!? Hang on, Yomi-onee-san! ......She hung up.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> W-Well, stuff like ghosts isn&#x27;t scary or anything! Cause, I&#x27;m super strong and all. There&#x27;s nothing I can&#x27;t beat... ...Ah-- But, can you beat a ghost with an okatana?		[Minor trivia, Yume&#x27;s okatana, Nikkari Ao&#x27;e, actually got its name for a legend in which it killed a ghost]<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I didn&#x27;t notice it, but it&#x27;s completely dark outside. ...I can&#x27;t take this anymore! I don&#x27;t wanna stay here all alone by myself until morning--!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Oh, I got it! Sayaka-chan might be scared all by herself. Since I&#x27;m so strong, I&#x27;ll go and help Sayaka-chan out.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I&#x27;ll bring my snacks, and my cards, and othello with me... Okay, here I go!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Wait, th-there it is---! The ghost----!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Tsubakuro Yume? What&#x27;s wrong? Was there a ghost?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ah-- Sayaka-chan. Th-That&#x27;s not it! There&#x27;s no way a ghost was here! Geez-, don&#x27;t scare me like that, okay? And, what&#x27;s with you? What do you have all those snacks for.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Can I sleep in this room?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Huh?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> It&#x27;s lonely, being in a big room by yourself... And, I thought... Maybe Tsubakuro Yume was feeling the same way... Do you want to eat Mai&#x27;s cookies together?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> W-Well I wasn&#x27;t scared of ghosts or feeling lonely or anything, but if that&#x27;s what you wanna do, then that&#x27;s okay-!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> (Thank goodness. If Sayaka-chan is here with me, I should be fine.)  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="3-the-result-of-their-competition-is"></a>3: The Result of Their Competition Is...<a class="hash-link" href="#3-the-result-of-their-competition-is" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Yume:</strong> These cookies are actually really tasty! I feel like I could eat them forever.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> That&#x27;s good. I think Mai will be happy to hear it too.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Hey, hey, Sayaka-chan, after we&#x27;re done eating, let&#x27;s play othello! We kept getting ties in cards, but I won&#x27;t lose for sure at othello!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm. I&#x27;ll try it...<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Ah, you took a corner again... You&#x27;re tough, Tsubakuro Yume.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> This much is nothing-. Maki-onee-san and them are always training me super hard.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> So you do things like that too... I&#x27;m a little surprised.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Even though they&#x27;re always treating me like a little kid, they never go easy on me when we&#x27;re playing games-. Really, they can be so immature it&#x27;s annoying.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> What about you, Sayaka-chan? Don&#x27;t the onee-sans always treat you like a little kid?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Ummm... I... It doesn&#x27;t bother me at all, but the others, they say that Mai&#x27;s... She&#x27;s too overprotective of me...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Hmm. It sorta seems like we both have it hard, being the youngest, don&#x27;t we.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm... Ah, if I put this here...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> No way! You flipped that many!? You turned the game around in one go. Now I don&#x27;t have anywhere to put any!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> I win...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Mmgh... That&#x27;s only cause I got a little distracted talking to you now! We&#x27;re playing again! I&#x27;m not stopping until I win!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> That&#x27;s fine, but... I&#x27;m a little tired... I&#x27;ll take a short rest...<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> [snooze]...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh-, hey, Sayaka-chan! Wait... She&#x27;s really asleep now.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Well, if you&#x27;re gonna be like that, then I guess I&#x27;ll have to let you borrow my futon!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Yawn~, looking at Sayaka-chan while she&#x27;s sleeping is making me feel sleepy too... Nn...<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Tsubakuro Yume, wake up. Your phone is ringing.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> It&#x27;s Maki-onee-san. What&#x27;s she want? Hello-?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Yume, take Itomi with you and head to the site of the mission. From the sound of things, the count of aradama there now dwarfs the amount yesterday.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> We&#x27;re headed there too right now, but it&#x27;s going to be a while before we arrive. Could you two find a way to hold out there on your own?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Yeah, me and Sayaka-chan&#x27;ll be fine. We&#x27;ll finish it up before you onee-sans even get there. Right-, Sayaka-chan?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Right... Let&#x27;s go.<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> GUOOOOOOOOO!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Uwah-, it&#x27;s true! There&#x27;s way more of them today-!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> This looks... a little difficult today.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> This&#x27;ll be a piece of cake. Sayaka-chan, let&#x27;s have another competition to see who can beat the most again today!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ......Hey, Tsubakuro Yume... Instead of a competition today, what if we work together?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Work together? But, we can&#x27;t tell which one of us wins if we do that.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> We still haven&#x27;t done... the punishment game for othello last night. So... can I make your punishment that we have to fight together?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Nngh... If you say so, then... Fine, but just for today!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Okay. Then... Let&#x27;s go.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I&#x27;m next! HAAAH!!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Pant... Pant... I can finally... see the end of them. Let&#x27;s finish... the last of them together.<br>
<strong>Yume/Sayaka:</strong> YAAA-----------!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> We did it-! I thought it would be a little bit harder, but now that it&#x27;s over, we beat them pretty easy, huh.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm. It&#x27;s because you were helping me, Tsubakuro Yume.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> ...Then, let&#x27;s do a high five! Yaay-!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> What&#x27;s going on here?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Sayaka-chan and Tsubakuro-san, high fiving...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ah-- You&#x27;re late, onee-sans-! We already took care of it with just the two of us.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Eh!? The two of you took care of all those aradama?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> When we put our skills together, it was as easy as that! See, Sayaka-chan, she&#x27;s really strong!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> No, you did a lot of the work, Tsubakuro Yume. You really are... very strong.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> They seem to have gotten much closer while we were away.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> That&#x27;s for sure. Yesterday, she was all fired up about, &quot;We&#x27;re having a competition!&quot; Did you settle that already?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ah-! That&#x27;s right, we were competing, weren&#x27;t we.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Sigh, Maki-san... Just when they were getting along, you had to go and bring that up...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Sayaka-chan, we still haven&#x27;t settled our aradama competition, and I&#x27;m not gonna let you back down from othello just cause you won once!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm, I&#x27;ll take your challenge as many times as you want.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Fufu, it seems like their rivalry won&#x27;t be stopping anytime soon.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations/edit/docs/Entwining_Bonds:_Fierce_Genius_x_Strange_Genius.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_2_ui" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_3DPF"></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"></div></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_35-E thin-scrollbar"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#1-an-awkward-trip-for-two" class="table-of-contents__link">1: An Awkward Trip for Two?</a></li><li><a href="#2-yume-and-sayakas-showdown-begins" class="table-of-contents__link">2: Yume and Sayaka&#39;s Showdown Begins!</a></li><li><a href="#3-the-result-of-their-competition-is" class="table-of-contents__link">3: The Result of Their Competition Is...</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Links</div><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://pastebin.com/LdyviZ8Z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Translator anon&#x27;s pastebin<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Site source code<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Built with Docusaurus.</div></div></div></footer></div>
