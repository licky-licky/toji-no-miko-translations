I&#x27;ve been waiting for this-!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Right! I&#x27;ve been so excited! What&#x27;s off campus learning about, anyway?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> You don&#x27;t even know that, and yet you were still excited...?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I really like the word &quot;off-campus&quot;! I&#x27;m not a fan of the word &quot;learning&quot; though...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Putting it simply, off-campus learning is like a field trip. Twelve of us toji were let off duty to see the famous places around Yokohama.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> But I counted us up and there&#x27;s only eleven people here? It&#x27;s past the meeting time too.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> ...Sorry~! I was running late~!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah-! It&#x27;s Ellen-chan!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> I screwed up! I got so excited about the off-campus learning that I was up late last night, and then I overslept!<br>
<strong>Nakano Jun:</strong> Ufufu. You&#x27;re like a kid, getting all worked up over a trip.<br>
<strong>Hasui Mayumi:</strong> Whatever the reason, you shouldn&#x27;t be tardy. When moving as a group, if even one person is late, it affects everyone, you know?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Uuu... I&#x27;m ashamed...<br>
<strong>Himeno Shiho:</strong> Now, now. She was only a few minutes late, so I think we can overlook it.<br>
<strong>Naruse Miki:</strong> She&#x27;s right. We&#x27;re here to have a good and fun time learning off-campus, after all~.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Hey, hey! What are we doing first? Was it already decided where we&#x27;re going and what we&#x27;re seeing?<br>
<strong>Fukuda Sawano:</strong> Nothing&#x27;s been decided yet. The rule is that all the toji gathered get to go where they see fit.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Oh, okay! Then, does anyone have any ideas--<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong>  Before we decide on a destination, there&#x27;s something that needs to be done.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> If we travel as such a large group, we would inconvenience other tourists. As such, we should separate into something more suitable.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> With twelve of us, two groups of six should do nicely. It doesn&#x27;t matter how the teams are decided--<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> If that&#x27;s how we&#x27;re doing this...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Tada-! We can draw straws.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> You&#x27;re always ready for anything, huh, Chii-nee!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> I am the oldest student here, after all. Anyway, mutter mutter mutter... There. Two groups of six...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> And, all done. Everyone, come draw a straw. They&#x27;ll all have &quot;red&quot; or &quot;white&quot; marked on them.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Okay, I&#x27;ll go! Mmm... It&#x27;s red!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...I&#x27;m red too.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Yaay! We&#x27;re on the same team, Hiyori-chan!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...Seems like it.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> You don&#x27;t sound excited about it, Hiyori-chan!<br>
<strong>Sawano:</strong> Which team will I be on... It&#x27;s tense, isn&#x27;t it? Ah, white.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> I&#x27;m white as well. Let&#x27;s get along.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I got red... I didn&#x27;t make it on the same team as Chii-nee, huh~.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Fufu, don&#x27;t be like that. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll be fun on both teams.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Now then... Everyone appears to have found their team. We should both separate and discuss where we would like to go.<br>
<strong>Fujimaki Minaki:</strong> On it! Everyone on red team with me! Let&#x27;s group up over here!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Everyone on the white team! We&#x27;re going to be spending the next two days together!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="2-mayumis-guidebook"></a>2: Mayumi&#x27;s Guidebook<a class="hash-link" href="#2-mayumis-guidebook" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Minaki:</strong> So anyway, everyone from red team, let&#x27;s go around and introduce ourselves a little!<br>
<strong>Minaki:</strong> I&#x27;m Fujimaki Minaki, a first year high schooler from Renpu Girls&#x27; School! I love it when everyone&#x27;s getting all worked up! So let&#x27;s get to it today and tomorrow~!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I&#x27;m Etou Kanami, a second year middle schooler at Minoseki Academy! I like fighting matches against all kinds of people! Let&#x27;s get along!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Same here, I&#x27;m a second year middle schooler from Minoseki, Asakura Mihono! I don&#x27;t usually go out with everyone like this, so I&#x27;m really excited! Please look after me!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...Third year middle schooler from the Heijou Institute, Juujou Hiyori.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Ehh? That&#x27;s all?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> There&#x27;s nothing more to say.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ehehe~. Hiyori-chan&#x27;s a little hard to get used to, but she&#x27;s a good girl on the inside. Try to get along with her!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> I-I don&#x27;t need your help!<br>
<strong>Jun:</strong> I&#x27;m a second year high schooler from Ayanokouji Martial Arts School; the name&#x27;s Nakano Jun. Let&#x27;s have a good one.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Kyoto dialect! That&#x27;s so cool!<br>
<strong>Jun:</strong> Ufufu. I&#x27;ll get a big head if you keep complimenting me like that.<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> I&#x27;m last! My name is Hasui Mayumi; I&#x27;m a second year in middle school at Ayanokouji Martial Arts School!<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> Onee-samas, please guide me as you see fit!<br>
<strong>Jun:</strong> So lemme see, us six in the red team would be me, Etou Kanami-san, Asakura Mihono-san, Juujou Hiyori-san, Fujimaki Minaki-san, and Hasui Mayumi-san. Is that right?<br>
<strong>Minaki:</strong> Yep, that&#x27;s all of us!<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> This may seem sudden, but if you don&#x27;t mind, I prepared a &quot;travel guide&quot; for today.<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> If we follow the schedule I&#x27;ve laid out, we could see a castle, the western style residences, Chinatown, and an amusement park. How does that sound?<br>
<strong>Jun:</strong> You studied up on all that? Hey, good on you.<br>
<strong>Minaki:</strong> If you&#x27;ve already figured out the places to go, then that&#x27;s a huge help!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah! I think the red team should just follow that schedule!<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> Thank you very much! Then without delay, we should get on a train to reach our first destination, the castle!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> The travel guide says we should be able to see the castle as soon as we get out of this shopping district...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Oh, look, look! You can see it from here! Wow-! It&#x27;s a real castle-!<br>
<strong>Jun:</strong> Sure is. The cherry blossoms are blooming beautifully too.<br>
<strong>Minaki:</strong> It&#x27;s all thanks to Mayumi-san we got to see this!<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> I&#x27;m glad to see you all so satisfied by it. That reminds me, about our next stop--<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> GRRRRUUUUUU...!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> -!! Everyone!! There&#x27;s an aradama!!<br>
<strong>Jun:</strong> Ufufu. Today&#x27;s not your day, is it, Mr. Aradama? To show up just when all us toji did.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Guys! The staff at the castle said, as thanks for taking care of the aradama, they&#x27;ll loan us hakama for the day!<br>
<strong>Jun:</strong> My, that&#x27;s awfully nice of them.<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> It&#x27;s about time we left for our next destination, but we can&#x27;t exactly reject their kind offer, can we...<br>
<strong>Minaki:</strong> It&#x27;s a good opportunity, so let&#x27;s get our photos taken wearing hakama! And we&#x27;ll have to get the castle and the cherry blossoms in the background too!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I like the sound of that! That aradama surprised me, but this off-campus learning is pretty fun! I can&#x27;t wait to see what&#x27;s next!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="3-a-lifelong-memory"></a>3: A Lifelong Memory<a class="hash-link" href="#3-a-lifelong-memory" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Chie:</strong> Let&#x27;s see~, so the ones who drew white straws would be me and... Mirja, Kohagura Ellen-san, Fukuda Sawano-san, Himeno Shiho-san, and Naruse Miki-san... That&#x27;s six.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> So then, since we&#x27;ll be spending the next two days together, why don&#x27;t we all introduce ourselves?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> I&#x27;m Setouchi Chie, a third year in high school at Osafune Girls&#x27; Academy. Let&#x27;s get along.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> I&#x27;m Kohagura Ellen! A first year high schooler at Osafune Girls&#x27; Academy! I&#x27;m looking forward to this!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> My name is Kitora Mirja; I&#x27;m a second year in high school at Ayanokouji Martial Arts School. Nice to meet you.<br>
<strong>Sawano:</strong> I&#x27;m Fukuda Sawano, a second year high schooler from Minoseki Academy. My hobby is reading. It&#x27;s nice to meet you.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Fukuda Sawano-san... Are you the one they call Minoseki&#x27;s Lord of the Library?<br>
<strong>Sawano:</strong> ...The underclassmen started calling me that, because I&#x27;m always in the library. By the way, who did you hear about that nickname from?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> From Kanamin, Etou Kanami!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> She said the Lord of the Library knows what&#x27;s in every book, and you helped her over and over again when she&#x27;s looking up swordfighting instructions!<br>
<strong>Sawano:</strong> Every book&#x27;s a bit of a stretch, but I have looked through most of them.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> So that&#x27;s why they call you Lord...! I&#x27;d love to be able to ask you next time I have a question about a book.<br>
<strong>Sawano:</strong> I don&#x27;t mind, but could I ask you to please not spread that nickname around any further...?<br>
<strong>Shiho:</strong> My name&#x27;s Himeno Shiho; I&#x27;m a middle schooler from the Heijou Institute. I&#x27;m a third year, but I transferred in mid-way so I only started learning how to use a sword last year-.<br>
<strong>Shiho:</strong> As for what I like, that&#x27;d be animals! I&#x27;m looking forward to these next two days!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> You&#x27;re an animal lover! So do you own any pets?<br>
<strong>Shiho:</strong> Of course. I&#x27;ve got loads of them. My parents take in a lot of abandoned cats and dogs.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Your parents sound great! I love animals too, so I&#x27;d love to see your house sometime!<br>
<strong>Shiho:</strong> Sure thing! You&#x27;re welcome any time!<br>
<strong>Miki:</strong> Seems like I&#x27;m last. I&#x27;m Naruse Miki, a second year in high school at the Heijou Institute. I plan to make a lifelong memory with you all today~.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> A lifelong memory? What a beautiful phrase! I want to enjoy this as much as I can with all of you too!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Is there anywhere any of you wanted to go around Yokohama, or anything you want to do?<br>
<strong>Miki:</strong> In order to make this a lifelong memory, I&#x27;m looking for a unique experience~.<br>
<strong>Miki:</strong> I&#x27;ve heard of a very exotic place called the Brick District, where you seem to be able to ride horse-drawn carriages...<br>
<strong>Shiho:</strong> Horses! I want to see them-!<br>
<strong>Miki:</strong> I hear they make delicious dango there as well~.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Mmmm! I can sense the perfect plan forming! We&#x27;ll go ride horse-drawn carriages in the Brick District, and then eat dango!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> The purpose of this trip is off-campus learning, so I believe we should study at a museum or similar institution in the area...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Now, now. There&#x27;s a lot of history in horse-drawn carriages too.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Exactly! And then we can study Japanese foods in detail with the dango!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> That one&#x27;s a little harder to justify...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Chew chew... The dango in the Brick District are so good. You can really taste the Westernization.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Westernized dango...!? What does that taste like?<br>
<strong>Shiho:</strong> Ahh! Look! There&#x27;s horses over there! So cute... Let&#x27;s hurry up and get in a carriage!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Everyone! The locals said they&#x27;ll do us a favor and rent out hakama to us! Free of charge too!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Seriously!? I&#x27;ve always wanted to try on a hakama!! It&#x27;s our lucky day!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Come on, Mirja! Let&#x27;s change into hakama and eat dango in the carriage together! It&#x27;ll be like one big lesson in good old Japanese culture!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I-I understand. I&#x27;m coming, so, please don&#x27;t tug me so strongly.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="4-are-you-having-fun-hiyori-chan"></a>4: Are You Having Fun, Hiyori-Chan?<a class="hash-link" href="#4-are-you-having-fun-hiyori-chan" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Jun:</strong> They said we could return these hakama sometime tomorrow. Really, what kind folks they were.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> But we don&#x27;t know if we&#x27;ll run into more aradama, and they could get ruined if we fought in them. We should change back to our uniforms and only put them on when we&#x27;re taking pictures.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> --Hey, Hiyori-chan? Are you actually enjoying yourself? You&#x27;ve been looking bored this whole time.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Just forget about me. I&#x27;m not interested in this kind of event.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ehh-? This is a rare opportunity, so let&#x27;s have fun together!<br>
<strong>Minaki:</strong> That&#x27;s right! Usually, the only time we get to see girls from other schools is when missions put us together!<br>
<strong>Minaki:</strong> And we don&#x27;t get to chat freely on missions, so I think we should take advantage of vacations like this!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...Rather than deepening friendships, it&#x27;s more important that we keep improving ourselves through training.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> You&#x27;re such a stoic, Juujou-san...<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> Though, Juujou onee-sama is top class amongst toji, so she makes a convincing argument!<br>
<strong>Minaki:</strong> I didn&#x27;t even notice, but while we were talking, we made it to our next stop!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Wow...! These buildings are beautiful! What are they, again?<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> These are western style trading posts that foreigners came to live in during the Meiji period.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Whoa-! So these have been here since the Meiji period! Meiji was the one that came before Showa, right?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...After Meiji came Taisho. Then Showa was after that.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah-, it was!?<br>
<strong>Jun:</strong> You might need to do a little more studying, Asakura-chan.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ehehe~.<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> KIKIKIGIGIGIGI...<br>
<strong>Minaki:</strong> -!? Everybody!! Another aradama showed up!!<br>
<strong>Jun:</strong> An aradama right in downtown... We should deal with it before folks get hurt.<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> Onee-samas, it&#x27;s about time we headed for the next destination.<br>
<strong>Jun:</strong> It&#x27;s a shame we can&#x27;t see the inside while we&#x27;re here. That aradama kept us busy.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah, I hear you. But, at least we managed to suppress it before anything went wrong!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Oh yeah! Before we leave, don&#x27;t you want to take a commemorative photo wearing hakama?<br>
<strong>Minaki:</strong> That&#x27;s a good idea!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Alright! Hear that, Hiyori-chan! Start getting changed!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> I&#x27;ll pass.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ehh-! Don&#x27;t be like that! I absolutely have to see what you look like in a hakama!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I kinda want to see too.<br>
<strong>Jun:</strong> I think you&#x27;d look real good in one, Juujou-chan. I want you to try it on too.<br>
<strong>Minaki:</strong> Yeah! With her pretty black hair!<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> We can spare a bit of time in the schedule to see how Juujou onee-sama looks in a hakama!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Definitely! It&#x27;s fine if we&#x27;re a little late!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> So, Hiyori-chan! Until I get to see you in a hakama, I&#x27;m not moving an inch from this spot!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> And me too!ã€€I&#x27;ll be harder to move than a mountain!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> What are you doing...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I&#x27;m not moving!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I&#x27;m not moving!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ......Fine then. If you&#x27;re making me, then I&#x27;ll put it on for just a little while.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> We did it-!! Our plan paid off!! I can&#x27;t wait to see you in a hakama, Hiyori-chan!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="5-lets-go-horseriding"></a>5: Let&#x27;s Go Horseriding!<a class="hash-link" href="#5-lets-go-horseriding" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Shiho:</strong> Ahh...! Taking a horse-drawn carriage was awesome-! Seeing the horses like that kinda makes me want to go horse riding now!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Horse riding? That sounds fun too! Have you gone horse riding before, Shiho?<br>
<strong>Shiho:</strong> Yeah! I&#x27;m a little confident in my horse riding skills! Riding in a carriage is cool too, but when you&#x27;re up on the horse you get to feel the heat of its body and the muscles moving!<br>
<strong>Sawano:</strong> Horse riding...!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Come to think of it, there&#x27;s a ranch a little ways away from here, isn&#x27;t there? Are you interested in going horse riding too, Fukuda-san?<br>
<strong>Sawano:</strong> There&#x27;s a scene in a book I read about warlords in the warring states period racing across the battlefield on horseback, and ever since then I&#x27;ve been greatly interested in trying it.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Very well, then that ranch will be our next destination. Is that alright with you, Naruse Miki?<br>
<strong>Miki:</strong> A ranch... Horse riding sounds scary, but that could be a lifelong memory in its own way. That&#x27;s fine~.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> It&#x27;s settled! We&#x27;re headed to the ranch to get some horse riding experience!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Good! Everything&#x27;s ready! The ranch lent us a horse, so we can ride it up this track one at a time!<br>
<strong>Miki:</strong> Seeing a horse up close like this, it&#x27;s huge...! What an impressive animal...!<br>
<strong>Shiho:</strong> Hey, horsey. We&#x27;re all going to take turns riding you, okay?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Shiho&#x27;s talking to the horse! Can it understand you!? Is that some special ability!?<br>
<strong>Shiho:</strong> Ahaha, nothing like that. It&#x27;s just a one sided chat--<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> SHAAAAAAAA!<br>
<strong>Miki:</strong> -!? There&#x27;s an aradama at the other end! Look, there!<br>
<strong>Shiho:</strong> Not good! It might go after the animals on the ranch! Horsey, I need you to get me after it quick!<br>
<strong>Chiho:</strong> Ehh-!? You&#x27;re going after the aradama on horseback!?<br>
<strong>Shiho:</strong> Yeah! I&#x27;ll cut it off!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Wait! It&#x27;s dangerous to fight an aradama alone!<br>
<strong>Shiho:</strong> Even so, I&#x27;m not letting it get near the animals!! Giddy up!!<br>
<strong>Miki:</strong> A-Amazing...! She&#x27;s handling that horse like a professional...!<br>
<strong>Sawano:</strong> It&#x27;s breathtaking...!<br>
<strong>Sawano:</strong> -But now&#x27;s not the time to admire her! We need to run and catch up!<br>
<strong>Shiho:</strong> Thank goodness... It doesn&#x27;t seem like any of the animals were hurt.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Yes, thanks to Himeno Shiho&#x27;s swift arrival, it seems none of them were harmed. However, you were lucky this time.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> By operating alone, you realize were exposing yourself to needless danger? Especially with so many other toji ready to fight.<br>
<strong>Shiho:</strong> I&#x27;m sorry... It&#x27;s just, when it comes to animals, I start losing sight of everything else...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Well, it all turned out for the best, didn&#x27;t it! It&#x27;s thanks to Shiho the animals were saved, right!<br>
<strong>Sawano:</strong> On top of that, it was incredible the way you rode that horse. Like a warlord straight from the stories.<br>
<strong>Miki:</strong> I&#x27;d love to be able to ride like that as well~. Could you show us again?<br>
<strong>Shiho:</strong> --Hehe. It&#x27;s embarrassing if you keep complimenting me like that.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> -! I just thought of something! While we&#x27;re here, why don&#x27;t we try on those hakama they lent us while we ride the horse!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Good idea. It&#x27;s a rare opportunity, so let&#x27;s get changed!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> (I wonder... What&#x27;s Mihono-chan up to right now? I hope she&#x27;s enjoying herself...)  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="6-the-inns-up-ahead-but"></a>6: The Inn&#x27;s Up Ahead, But...<a class="hash-link" href="#6-the-inns-up-ahead-but" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Kanami:</strong> Sigh... We&#x27;re almost to the inn, aren&#x27;t we...?<br>
<strong>Minaki:</strong> I-I&#x27;m beat...<br>
<strong>Jun:</strong> With all the aradama popping up, it was a real struggle sticking to the guide Hasui-chan laid out.<br>
<strong>Minaki:</strong> We didn&#x27;t even get to go inside the castle or the trading post...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> And even though we went to Chinatown, we didn&#x27;t have enough time to go in any of the stores. We had to eat convenience store bentos on the train...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> For the first time in my life, I went to an amusement park and didn&#x27;t get on any of the rides...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> I thought this off-campus learning would be a waste of time, but all this walking around has been a good lower body workout. We got to suppress aradama too.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> At least you&#x27;re thinking positive, Hiyori-chan...<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> Thanks to all your hard efforts, we&#x27;ve managed to safely follow through with the schedule! Thank you very much!<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> But, that schedule was impractical, wasn&#x27;t it. Because I didn&#x27;t take into account how aradama might appear, we were forced to rush through it. I&#x27;m deeply sorry.<br>
<strong>Jun:</strong> Nah, not at all. That tidy little travel guide of yours was a huge help.<br>
<strong>Minaki:</strong> We might be worn out, but we got to see lots of landmarks, and we got rid of the aradama fast, so the trip really feels complete!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Coming up with such a precise schedule must have been tough, right? You even looked up all the train times...<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> I like scheduling. So I tried my best to let you all get the most out of this.<br>
<strong>Jun:</strong> That reminds me, Hasui-chan? It&#x27;s only 5 in the evening, and there&#x27;s still plenty of time before dinner&#x27;s served, so why&#x27;d we have to hurry on back to the inn?<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> Isn&#x27;t that obvious! After 5 is when the city&#x27;s nightlife starts, and that&#x27;s not something for students to participate in!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Nightlife after 5...?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Hey, when we get to the inn, what should we do? I want to go exploring the place!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Exploring the inn! That sounds cool!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Are you little kids...!?<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> Hang on! It&#x27;s in the schedule that, before we eat dinner, we&#x27;ll take baths!<br>
<strong>Minaki:</strong> We&#x27;re even on the schedule in the inn!?<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> Of course. After eating dinner we&#x27;ll play cards for 45 minutes, and then have a pillow fight until lights out at 9pm.<br>
<strong>Minaki:</strong> Even goofing off is on the schedule!<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> We&#x27;ll wake up the next morning at 5am, then we&#x27;ll have 15 minutes to ready ourselves, followed by 30 minutes of bathtime. It&#x27;s important to provide some leisure time taking care of yourself in the morning, after all.<br>
<strong>Jun:</strong> Umm. I feel like there&#x27;s nothing leisurely sounding about waking up at 5 though...<br>
<strong>Minaki:</strong> But, we did agree to follow the schedule, after all! We should see it through till the end!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> You&#x27;re right! And if we don&#x27;t stick to it, we&#x27;ll never be able to wake up at 5!<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> Thank you very much! The off-campus learning doesn&#x27;t end until the trip&#x27;s over! Let&#x27;s try to stay focused until then!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah-!!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...That means, I have to get up at 5 too, doesn&#x27;t it...? Can I actually do that...?  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="7-nightlife"></a>7: Nightlife<a class="hash-link" href="#7-nightlife" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Chie:</strong> The sun&#x27;s fully set by now, hasn&#x27;t it. I lost track of time with how much fun we were having riding horses at the ranch.<br>
<strong>Sawano:</strong> We don&#x27;t need to check-in at the inn until 8 o&#x27;clock. That means we still have an hour of free time, so what should we do?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> I&#x27;m already hungry, but I want to stay out having a good time as long as we can!<br>
<strong>Miki:</strong> I feel the same way~. Let&#x27;s take a stroll down the streets in the night lighting and make some lifelong memories!<br>
<strong>Miki:</strong> I want to get some photos taken wearing the hakama we borrowed as well~.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Exploring the nightlife isn&#x27;t so commendable, but we can make an exception today.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> However, as soon as we&#x27;ve arrived at the inn and eaten, I want everyone in the bath and then bed, understood?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Ehh-!? But I wanted to have a pillow fight! And then play cards, and do a test of courage! I heard those are unbreakable traditions for Japanese students!<br>
<strong>Miki:</strong> A pillow fight, cards, and a test of courage! That sounds like a lifelong memory in the making!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> How many lifelong memories do you plan on experiencing today, Naruse Miki...?<br>
<strong>Miki:</strong> I&#x27;ll take every one I can come across~.<br>
<strong>Shiho:</strong> Ahh! Everybody! There&#x27;s a neat looking souvenir shop over there!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Come to think of it, I was wondering when I&#x27;d be able to get souvenirs for everyone back at school.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> I want to get something for Kaoru and Grandpa!<br>
<strong>Shiho:</strong> We should buy some now so we aren&#x27;t in a rush getting it done tomorrow.<br>
<strong>Miki:</strong> Maybe I can find a souvenir to leave a lifelong memory on someone...~<br>
<strong>Sawano:</strong> I think your expectations for souvenirs might be a little too high...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Ooh... They sell folding fans and hairpins, along with sweets here.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Oh-! This present! The Japanese design is so cute! I think Grandpa would like an ornate hairpin like this!<br>
<strong>Sawano:</strong> You mean for your grandfather? Those are usually used to do up a woman&#x27;s hair, so I don&#x27;t think a man would want one...<br>
<strong>Miki:</strong> It would certainly be a lifelong memory, though~.<br>
<strong>Miki:</strong> --Ah! Everyone! We should all buy these Japanese umbrellas! Then we can get our photos taken! It would look wonderful together with our hakama!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> ...Umbrella and hakama! That&#x27;s an awesome idea! Let&#x27;s pick out umbrellas for all of us--<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> GURURUUUUUUU...!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> -!? Where did that aradama&#x27;s roar come from!!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> From outside the shop! Everyone! Hurry!<br>
<strong>Miki:</strong> Now, since we safely defeated it, let&#x27;s all get changed to take a commemorative photo here~.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Fufufu. That&#x27;s certainly a lifelong memory, isn&#x27;t it.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> The shop gave us some umbrellas as a present! They said it&#x27;s thanks for defeating the aradama! Let&#x27;s get them in the photo!<br>
<strong>Sawano:</strong> A present, huh. It makes me feel a little guilty.<br>
<strong>Shiho:</strong> Then, let&#x27;s make up for it by buying tons of souvenirs before we go. That way everyone&#x27;s happy.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> These umbrellas are so beautiful... I&#x27;m glad. I&#x27;ll be sure to make good use of it.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Mmhmm, it totally suits you, Chie! Like a real &quot;Yamato Nadeshiko&quot;!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="8-off-campus-learning-finished"></a>8: Off-Campus Learning, Finished!<a class="hash-link" href="#8-off-campus-learning-finished" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Kanami:</strong> Man, what a refreshing morning!<br>
<strong>Minaki:</strong> I know! I was still pretty tired waking up at 5, but after relaxing in the bath, I&#x27;m feeling better than ever!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> And we have plenty of time to pick out souvenirs!<br>
<strong>Jun:</strong> It&#x27;s pretty nice actually, following a strict schedule.<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> Ehehe. I&#x27;m glad to hear you&#x27;re happy with it.<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> If there&#x27;s ever another opportunity like this, I&#x27;ll come up with an even more perfect travel guide for you!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Nnng... I should&#x27;ve... Slept some more... I knew it... I&#x27;m sleepy...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Come on, Mihono-chan! It&#x27;s the second day of our trip! It&#x27;s time to start getting excited!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...Anyway, are the other 6 from the white team not coming?<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> Mm! They&#x27;re late, aren&#x27;t they. We were supposed to meet at check-out time by the gift shop, and yet...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> They&#x27;re late? That&#x27;s weird... Chii-nee and Mirja-san are on that team, after all? Those two are never late for anything...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> ...Oh? Is everyone from the red team picking out souvenirs?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Huh!? It&#x27;s the white team! Why don&#x27;t you have your luggage with you!?<br>
<strong>Miki:</strong> Why? Well, we&#x27;re getting in the baths now~.<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> Now!? But we were supposed to check-out at 8!?<br>
<strong>Sawano:</strong> ? Check-out is at 10 o&#x27;clock, so there&#x27;s still 2 hours of free time.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> --Ehhhhh-!? Seriously!?<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> ...Let&#x27;s see. It seems I might have been mistaken about the check-out time when I was drawing up the schedule...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Check-in last night had to be before 8pm. I assume that&#x27;s where the misunderstanding came from.<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> ...It&#x27;s all my fault!! I&#x27;m so sorry for everything!!<br>
<strong>Jun:</strong> There&#x27;s no need for you to feel responsible, Hasui-chan. Everybody makes mistakes.<br>
<strong>Minaki:</strong> Right! None of us chcked the right time either, so it&#x27;s our fault too!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> In fact, I&#x27;m glad we get 2 extra hours to lounge around the inn!<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> O-Onee-samas...!! Thank you so much!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I know! Since we have the time, let&#x27;s get in the baths again! We can join the white team!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Sounds good! We can join forces from here! It&#x27;ll be more fun that way!<br>
<strong>Shiho:</strong> You know, it really feels like our off-campus learning trip is complete.<br>
<strong>Miki:</strong> I know~. We experienced so many things. There&#x27;s no problem finding a lifelong memory in all that~!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> How did things go for everyone on the red team?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> We found a lifelong memory too, of course! I got to see Hiyori-chan in a hakama!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah! She looked so natural wearing it! The photos turned out great too~!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Hey, when did you...!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Ufufu, it sounds like you had a good time.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong>  That&#x27;s great! I want to go around with the rest of you next time; I wish we could do this every month!</p></div><footer class="docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="row"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations/edit/docs/Spring_in_Full_Bloom_Combined_Off-Campus_Learning.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_2_ui" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_13-_"></div></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"></div></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_35-E thin-scrollbar"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#1-off-campus-learning" class="table-of-contents__link">1: Off-Campus Learning!</a></li><li><a href="#2-mayumis-guidebook" class="table-of-contents__link">2: Mayumi&#39;s Guidebook</a></li><li><a href="#3-a-lifelong-memory" class="table-of-contents__link">3: A Lifelong Memory</a></li><li><a href="#4-are-you-having-fun-hiyori-chan" class="table-of-contents__link">4: Are You Having Fun, Hiyori-Chan?</a></li><li><a href="#5-lets-go-horseriding" class="table-of-contents__link">5: Let&#39;s Go Horseriding!</a></li><li><a href="#6-the-inns-up-ahead-but" class="table-of-contents__link">6: The Inn&#39;s Up Ahead, But...</a></li><li><a href="#7-nightlife" class="table-of-contents__link">7: Nightlife</a></li><li><a href="#8-off-campus-learning-finished" class="table-of-contents__link">8: Off-Campus Learning, Finished!</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Links</div><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://pastebin.com/LdyviZ8Z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Translator anon&#x27;s pastebin<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Site source code<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Built with Docusaurus.</div></div></div></footer></div>
