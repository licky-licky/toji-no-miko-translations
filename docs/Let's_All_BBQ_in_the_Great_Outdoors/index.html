Barbecue, barbecue~!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Look at all the people around. Well, it is summer break. Something smells really tasty too!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> You&#x27;re just raring to go today, aren&#x27;t you, Mihomiho.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Heh heh heh-. That&#x27;s cause I&#x27;ve been waiting so long for this barbecue! I used up all my money getting the best meat I could buy, so you better start working up an appetite now, okay-?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Mihono-chan... Will you be alright with no spending money?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Since I live at the dorms, I just have to hang on a little bit till payday comes, and it&#x27;ll all be fine!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You get really fired up about these things sometimes, don&#x27;t you Hono-chan. We should follow her example.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> The best meat... My heart is full of anticipation, but it could be dangerous for us all to behave exactly as Asakura Mihono.<br>
<strong>Uraga Nao:</strong> Mirja told me all about you all; you really do seem like a fun bunch~. I think I lucked out tagging along for a refresher here~.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Uraga Nao, we need you to manage the barbecue for us, so go right ahead and show off your talents.<br>
<strong>Nao:</strong> When you put it like that, you&#x27;ll give them the wrong kind of expectations~. I&#x27;m not a barbecue master or anything, okay?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> That&#x27;s not true. You&#x27;re our powerful backup here.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> When the investigation team tries to do the cooking... Somebody slips in their own special ingredients, and it turns into a mystery hot pot... Or the curry ends up getting burnt.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> If everyone would just do as I tell them... Everything would turn out fine, you know...?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> But so long as you don&#x27;t go overboard, barbecuing is just as simple as cooking it.<br>
<strong>Nao:</strong> You&#x27;re right, there are lots of things you can easily barbecue, but to get the tastiest results, you can&#x27;t stop working the spatula, you see~?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Uraga-san, are you like a hot pot boss but for the barbecue? [Someone who gets very bossy when cooking at a hot pot.]<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> She is. However, she&#x27;s a hot pot boss as well, so she&#x27;s both boss of the hot pot and barbecue.<br>
<strong>Nao:</strong> Hey, you keep giving them the wrong idea~. I&#x27;m not the boss of anything~. Just someone who wants to cook stuff as delicious as it can be.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> With a barbecue boss here, my meat&#x27;s going to be the best it can be... Ehehe.<br>
<strong>Nao:</strong> ...Looks like it&#x27;s no use trying to stop this misunderstanding now, is it~...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Are we going to start getting the barbecue set up already? Or, since we&#x27;re here, should we play around by the water first?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> That&#x27;s an idea as well. Though I would like to consider the most efficient timing of heating up the barbecue.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> What do we do... Hono-chan, I just realized something important...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> What&#x27;s that?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Everyone here today... Besides us... They&#x27;re all so big.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I heard that development is linked to what you eat... It might be a good idea to try eating exactly like how they do...!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Hono-chan, this is our chance to get bigger!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Bigger? Like how? Anyway, the meat! We have to get the meat ready! You should eat some meat too, Kiyoka!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ahh, I can&#x27;t wait to see that meat start sizzling-.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> (Hono-chan... Meat is the only thing on her mind right now...)<br>
<strong>Nao:</strong> It&#x27;s nice and warm out, so an afternoon nap might be nice too~.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Now that would be refreshing. If Kaoru could hear you, she&#x27;d be jealous, fufu.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> (Mmmm, &quot;A sleeping child is a growing child&quot;... What if that saying is true?)<br>
<strong>Scream:</strong> UWAAAA...!? A-ARADAMAAA!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ! Guys, let&#x27;s go!<br>
<strong>Nao:</strong> Are you hurt~? Is anyone injured?<br>
<strong>Barbecue Goer:</strong> It&#x27;s nothing serious... But, the food for the barbecue...<br>
<strong>Nao:</strong> The food?<br>
<strong>Barbecue Goer:</strong> I don&#x27;t know why, but... They took most of the food.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> We saw this strange pattern before, with the chocolate stealing aradama. That behavior may have spread.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> It&#x27;s a good thing nobody was hurt, at least.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> They&#x27;re never getting away with stealing food from the barbecue! Let&#x27;s beat them all and get it back!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah, but first, I have to make sure my meat doesn&#x27;t get stolen too!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Right, it&#x27;s important we stay careful.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Wha...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> What? What&#x27;s wrong?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...It&#x27;s gone! My meat!! My meat&#x27;s not here!!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> IT&#x27;S GOOOONE!?  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="2-search-for-the-stolen-meat"></a>2: Search for the Stolen Meat<a class="hash-link" href="#2-search-for-the-stolen-meat" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> Pant... Pant... Where&#x27;s the aradama? Where&#x27;s my meat?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Get a hold of yourself, Asakura Mihono. For the time being, we&#x27;ve cleared the nearby area of aradama.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Hono-chan... I&#x27;m amazed how focused she is on this.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> She&#x27;s beaten the most aradama by herself, hasn&#x27;t she? Mihomiho&#x27;s potential is off the charts-.<br>
<strong>Nao:</strong> The spectrum meter is faintly reacting, but since we helped everyone evacuate for now, it should be safe~.<br>
<strong>Nao:</strong> The toji in charge of this area have arrived too.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> I understand how you must feel, Mihono-chan, but if you keep fighting like this you&#x27;ll burn yourself out. You can&#x27;t afford to push yourself too hard.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Okay... Ahh, I&#x27;m feeling hungry now... If this was going to happen, we should&#x27;ve done the barbecue as soon as we got here-.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Aradama must be meat eaters after all! When I was in Chinatown, they showed up at the meat bun shop too!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Have you ever actually seen them eating though? From my Papa and Grandpa&#x27;s research, aradama shouldn&#x27;t eat meat or other foods.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ehh-!? So wait, they took it even though they aren&#x27;t gonna eat it!? They&#x27;re just being mean!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> That&#x27;s the part that makes you upset, hmm...<br>
<strong>Nao:</strong> If I had my favorite food stolen out from under me right as I was looking forward to it, I think I&#x27;d be just as upset as Asakura-san~.<br>
<strong>Nao:</strong> Especially the mandarin oranges I have sent to me straight from the farm every winter. I&#x27;d hate to lose those.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Oh, do you mean the ones we take when we stop by your room from time to time?<br>
<strong>Nao:</strong> The ones I put out for you are just from the supermarket. Besides those, I always get just a few shipments of first rate mandarins~. But you&#x27;re not getting any~.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I&#x27;ll look forward to this year&#x27;s winter then. And spread the word to Mizushina Kinuka.<br>
<strong>Nao:</strong> Hey, Mirja!?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You two get along so well. I hardly ever see Mirja-san teasing with someone like this!<br>
<strong>Nao:</strong> Well, we are senpai and kouhai from the same school, and we&#x27;ve been hanging out together for a long time too~.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I think it&#x27;s nice to have that kind of relationship.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> That should be enough of a break, right?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> We have to get that meat back, so everyone who came here to barbecue today can go home with good memories!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> That&#x27;s right, we have to work our hardest.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> And no matter what, I&#x27;m not giving up on my meat!!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It&#x27;s no good if we don&#x27;t get your meat, Hono-chan. It looked so delicious, and this was the perfect chance to make some observations during the barbecue. We can&#x27;t afford to lose it!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Let&#x27;s go, Kiyoka! We&#x27;ll beat the aradama and barbecue! We&#x27;re coming to get you, my meaaaaat!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Eh? Kyaaaaa!? Hono-chan... You don&#x27;t have to drag meee...!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> They&#x27;ll make us look bad at this rate. We have to help make sure everyone can have a fun barbecue too!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> I don&#x27;t know why Mihono-chan is acting so unreasonably. I have to keep a close eye on her, as her onee-san. Mm!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> We should follow as well, Uraga Nao.<br>
<strong>Nao:</strong> Hmm, seeing everyone run off all willy nilly like this is making me wonder a little what the point of teaching everyone battle formations is~.<br>
<strong>Nao:</strong> In spite of all that, Asakura-san and them still manage to function as a team somehow. It&#x27;s beyond me~.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> About that, I do hold a similar impression, however, what matters most is our work right now.<br>
<strong>Nao:</strong> Ah, wait for me, Mirja~.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="3-lets-bbq"></a>3: Let&#x27;s BBQ!!<a class="hash-link" href="#3-lets-bbq" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> WELCOME BACK! MY MEAT!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> And nobody got hurt by the aradama either. All the food that was stolen got recovered, so everything turned out okay.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> We put the smiles back on the faces of everyone who came here to barbecue.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> They gave us all sorts of food to eat as thanks too.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> We have to make the most of their generosity by enjoying our trip here to the fullest.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> With that out of the way, let&#x27;s grill the meat!<br>
<strong>Nao:</strong> Hold your horses~. You can&#x27;t go spreading the meat across the whole grill. I know you want to grill it all as soon as you can, but still~.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> If we want the meat to be cooked all the way through, shouldn&#x27;t we begin grilling them as soon as possible?<br>
<strong>Nao:</strong> That&#x27;s true, but we have to arrange things depending on the heat. Where there&#x27;s lots of charcoal packed together, where it&#x27;s spread out, and where there&#x27;s hardly any.<br>
<strong>Nao:</strong> The highest temperature areas are reserved for the meat, and the vegetables that heat poorly. We can put the Shiitake and peppers and the like where there&#x27;s remaining heat on the sides.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> That makes sense... Leave it to the BBQ Boss!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I see I was right to call you here.<br>
<strong>Nao:</strong> I&#x27;m not a commanding officer for nothing, you know~. You need a plan for everything, even cooking up delicious meat, alright?<br>
<strong>Nao:</strong> For example, when you see it getting burned from the high heat, you should move it somewhere with a lower temperature~.<br>
<strong>Nao:</strong> And then, you wait until it&#x27;s cooked all the way to the center~. That&#x27;ll make the outside nice and crunchy, and the inside...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> All juicyyy!<br>
<strong>Nao:</strong> You got it~. Anyway, I&#x27;ll tell you which ones are ready to eat.<br>
<strong>Nao:</strong> The ones right in the middle are good to go. The foil wrapped mushrooms next to it should be fine too~.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Here, Mihomiho. You eat this one.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Can I?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Of course; you&#x27;re the one who brought it for us. You worked the hardest to suppress the aradama too.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Then... I&#x27;m digging in~! ...Omfh!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> MMMM<del></del>!!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I can tell how tasty it is just from the look on Hono-chan&#x27;s face... Gulp.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...You don&#x27;t need words when it comes to meat. Eat up, everyone, come on! Come on, Uraga-san, Kiyoka!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Th-Then... H-Here I go, Hono-chan!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...!!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> S-So good... It&#x27;s so good, Hono-chan!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Right?<br>
<strong>Nao:</strong> This really is some good meat~. I&#x27;ll keep on grilling them up for you, okaaay~.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> And we&#x27;ll keep on eating them-! Omh... Ahh~, I&#x27;m so glad to be here right now...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Nothing beats eating meat under a clear blue sky. Chew chew... Delicious~.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> If only Kaoru could have come along.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> I know, Kaoru-san is always so hard at work... Chew chew.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Urgh... Huh...?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> ...With such a deep flavor... I doubt I could ever tire of eating it. Chew chew...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Nn...? I feel...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> However... It would be unfair to leave Uraga Nao in charge of all the preparations, so we should assist her as we enjoy ourselves.<br>
<strong>Nao:</strong> Thank you~. Ah, be sure not to use the tongs you use to pick up the meat with any of the other food, okay?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Understood.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> By the way, Asakura Mihono, Musumi Kiyoka. Is something wrong? You haven&#x27;t moved your chopsticks or joined the conversation for some time now.<br>
<strong>Mihono/Kiyoka:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> That&#x27;s because... When I eat the meat, there&#x27;s this weird feeling around my chest...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Me too...! That&#x27;s what it feels like...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Oh goodness, do you have heartburn? Is it because you&#x27;ve been eating nothing but meat, I wonder?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Th-This is that heartburn stuff!? I think this is the first time I&#x27;ve had it...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> And now I can&#x27;t even eat my meat I worked so hard for~, I don&#x27;t believe this...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah-! Look, Hono-chan...!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Chie-san, Ellen-san, and them... They&#x27;re eating all kinds of food besides the meat!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> We should try eating the same as they do for now.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It could help with our alliance activities, and we can cleanse our palates a little. Maybe after a while, we&#x27;ll be able to eat meat without getting heartburn?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Th-That sounds like it could work?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Then, let&#x27;s not wait around... It&#x27;s time to take action!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Chie-san, what you&#x27;re eating, is that cheese fondue? Could we have some?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Of course. But, since you&#x27;re feeling heartburn, shouldn&#x27;t you take a short breather? I&#x27;ll be sure to set aside some food for you two.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> No thanks, I feel fine! When it comes to our objective... Girls have another stomach for this! Right, Hono-chan?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Y-Yeah.<br>
<strong>Nao:</strong> We have potatoes, pumpkin, bread, and mushrooms here, so go ahead and grab a mouthful~.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Hot... It&#x27;s hot! But the cheese is so yummy that I can eat it normally!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> The cherry tomatoes go great with it too! I think... This is going to work, Hono-chan.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> (If I just wait a bit for the meat... I&#x27;m sure I can eat it like normal too!)<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> (Strangely, it seems Asakura Mihono and Musumi Kiyoka have been copying whatever we eat for some time now?)<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> (No, there can&#x27;t be any deeper reason for it. Sometimes food simply appears tastier after watching another eat it.)<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Alright, time to dig into the meat again! That was just a fluke before!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> When it comes to meat... Where there&#x27;s a will, there&#x27;s a way!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> (It seems I was mistaken after all.)<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> That sizzling sound it makes is so nice. Think it&#x27;s ready-? They said to be careful not to overcook it.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> You&#x27;re having some too, right Kiyoka?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Right...! Thank you, Hono-chan! Let&#x27;s give it a try!<br>
<strong>Mihono/Kiyoka:</strong> Ahm...!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Mmmggh.....!?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Why... Why...!? Even though it&#x27;s so good! What&#x27;s with this!? It&#x27;s like my chest is saying no to the meat!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...Hono-chan...! I&#x27;m feeling it... too...!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> We can eat everything else okay, but... Uuu... My meat...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> And Chie-san and the others are still eating the meat without a care in the world... Why is it only us...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Don&#x27;t tell me... If your breasts grow big enough, you can eat without getting heartburn?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> No wait, don&#x27;t they say that you have to eat a lot of meat to grow bigger!?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Then that means... If we can&#x27;t eat because of heartburn, then we won&#x27;t...!<br>
