<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Wouldn&#x27;t you guys have to die first to get reincarnated here?<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> I mean, you&#x27;re not wrong, but isn&#x27;t it easier to understand that way? It sums up what&#x27;s happening.<br>
<strong>Mii:</strong> I do understand what you&#x27;re getting at though.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> By the way, Konori. Is there anything we can do to make things more comfortable for you here?<br>
<strong>Mii:</strong> No, we&#x27;re fine right now. Thanks for asking. You&#x27;ve done so much for us. It&#x27;s been a huge help.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> We want to look out for you too, but there might be things we&#x27;ve missed. So, not only you, Konori-san, but if any of you need anything, feel free to ask.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Biribiri-onee-san. Show me how you make it all crackly again.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> Biribiri-onee-san, huh...<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> Well, it beats being called just &quot;Biribiri&quot; at least.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> Since we&#x27;re indoors, I&#x27;m only going to do it a little.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Isn&#x27;t it kinda cool how she can manipulate electricity like that?<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> While we&#x27;re on the topic Misaka-san can shoot electricity. Shirai-san can teleport. What kind of powers do the rest of you have?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Those kind of powers are pretty exciting, after all. You can&#x27;t help but want to see more-.<br>
<strong>Mii:</strong> My power is clairvoyance. Let&#x27;s see; I could tell you what kind of cakes are inside that box.<br>
<strong>Mii:</strong> A strawberry shortcake, a cheesecake, a Mont Blanc, and a Pudding a la Mode. They each look delicious.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Wow... That&#x27;s amazing, you got them all right.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> You&#x27;re all so crazy. What kind of powers do Uiharu-san and Saten-san have?<br>
<strong>Kazari:</strong> When you look at me so expectantly, I can&#x27;t help but feel like you&#x27;ll be disappointed... I have the power to keep whatever I touch at a fixed temperature.<br>
<strong>Kazari:</strong> Its name is &quot;Thermal Hand&quot;, but since I&#x27;m just a level 1, I can&#x27;t do anything significant with it.<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> Uiharu-. When you put it that way, it makes it hard for a level 0 like me to speak up.<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> Mine&#x27;s &quot;Aero Hand&quot;, but since my level&#x27;s too low, the effects of it are too weak to even see-. Sorry about that.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> No, there&#x27;s nothing you need to apologize for, Saten Ruiko. It&#x27;s very interesting being able to learn about the Academy City you come from.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> They seriously are from out of this world.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I&#x27;m slightly curious about one point. Level 1, level 0; are they divided based on the power, range, duration, and so on?<br>
<strong>Kuroko:</strong> In general, it&#x27;s fine to assume as much.<br>
<strong>Kuroko:</strong> There exist levels 0 through 5. And, up at the top, among the many espers, there are only seven level 5s. And, one of those seven is Misaka Mikoto-onee-sama herself!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Huh, so Biribiri-onee-san&#x27;s one. Is she that great?<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> ...Hey, Kuroko! Do you have to praise me up even after coming to another world? And besides, Shokuhou&#x27;s a level 5 too.<br>
<strong>Kuroko:</strong> I only ensured that everyone had a more proper image of you.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> What kind of power do you have, Shokuhou-san?<br>
<strong>Misaki:</strong> My power isss--<br>
<strong>Misaki:</strong> A secret~. It&#x27;s not the kind of ability that&#x27;s any fun to show off, you know?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> It isn&#x27;t...? That&#x27;s too bad.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Well, everybody&#x27;s got their own circumstances.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> ...Can we talk for a minute?<br>
<strong>Misaki:</strong> What abouut? I don&#x27;t have that much time to spend chatting with you.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> Under no circumstances are you going to alter these people&#x27;s memories or anything, right?<br>
<strong>Misaki:</strong> Sigh... Now why would I go and do that? There&#x27;s no merit in it for me.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> That&#x27;s fine then.<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> When you toji are fighting aradama, you can jump around really far. Is that some kind of special power?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> We can enhance our strength like that, using our okatana as a medium.<br>
<strong>Mii:</strong> Then, is the reason aradama&#x27;s attacks don&#x27;t hurt you also because of your okatana?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> That&#x27;s right. It can temporarily raise our body&#x27;s endurance.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> As far as defense goes, there&#x27;s also one more aspect to it. We can apply something called &quot;utsushi&quot;.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> It&#x27;s a technique that converts our bodies to something of a state of pure energy.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> With utsushi applied, even if we were fatally injured, when utsushi is removed, the injury is gone as well.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> There&#x27;s still some mental damage left over though.<br>
<strong>Kazari:</strong> It&#x27;s like a kind of barrier, or like a body replacement technique, isn&#x27;t it!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Sure, let&#x27;s go with that.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> From hearing about them, your toji powers... Aren&#x27;t your skills pretty incredible too?<br>
<strong>Mii:</strong> They might have been developed to combat aradama, but some are awe-inspiring to see.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> You think so-? Isn&#x27;t it way cooler if each and everybody has their own power?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I think we&#x27;d both feel that way about the things we&#x27;re less used to.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> As far as I can tell, there aren&#x27;t any major issues with you living here, but I hope we can find a method of getting you back home soon.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> We&#x27;re doing all we can to collect that metal that we sometimes find mixed in with the noro, but we haven&#x27;t gotten very far. All we can do is wait for more news from the investigation.<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> That reminds me...<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> I don&#x27;t think this has anything to do with the aradama with that metal from Misaka-san&#x27;s experiment, but I did hear a sorta interesting rumor about an aradama.<br>
<strong>Kazari:</strong> You really can&#x27;t stop thinking about rumors and urban legends, can you, Saten-san.<br>
<strong>Kuroko:</strong> I can&#x27;t believe you would keep that up even after coming to this world. Could I ask you not to stick your neck into trouble?<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> I just got curious if there were any urban legends unique to here, so I asked around a little.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> If you&#x27;ve heard an interesting rumor regarding aradama, I&#x27;d be interested in knowing more too-. I do research into aradama.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> What was this urban legend about?<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> I heard that, even though aradama look like scary monsters, there&#x27;s an aradama that&#x27;s small and cute too...!<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> Though, the toji who told me about it hadn&#x27;t actually seen it herself.<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> But still, don&#x27;t you just want to get to the bottom of this!? Is it some kind of mutant? Was it made by some mad scientist&#x27;s experiment ...My imagination&#x27;s running wild here!<br>
<strong>Kazari:</strong> That&#x27;s a bad habit of yours, Saten-san.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Hmm hmm. You&#x27;re right, that is fascinating. I&#x27;d like to know the truth behind it-.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Umm, isn&#x27;t that...<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> ...!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Though, I am busy, so I won&#x27;t be able to chase down this mystery. How bothersome-.<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> In that case, I&#x27;ll get to the bottom of this one for sure! It&#x27;s not like I&#x27;ve got anything better to do anyway!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I&#x27;ll look forward to it then. Ah, but please, don&#x27;t go doing anything dangerous.<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> I got it-. Uiharu, starting tomorrow, we&#x27;ve got an important mission to hunt down the truth of an urban legend!<br>
<strong>Kazari:</strong> Ehh-- I&#x27;m a part of this too-!?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> When we have the time, we&#x27;ll join you! You&#x27;d be in trouble if you actually ran into an aradama.<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> Thanks so much! Whenever you&#x27;re free, just come on board!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="2-chasing-urban-legends"></a>2: Chasing Urban Legends<a class="hash-link" href="#2-chasing-urban-legends" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Ruiko:</strong> Thanks for everything-.<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> Hmm, none of the info I&#x27;m getting sounds all that convincing. Though, getting clues bit by bit is the real fun of urban legends!<br>
<strong>Kuroko:</strong> Everyone we&#x27;ve asked about about a small cute aradama has given us blank stares or looks of confusion.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Aradama are inherently something to be feared. Reactions like those are only natural.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> They go on rampages and attack people after all. Are you sure this urban legend isn&#x27;t just completely made up?<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> You don&#x27;t get it, Misaka-san. Even the fact that it might be made up is what makes hunting down the truth so romantic.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> You really do love this sort of thing, don&#x27;t you, Saten-san.<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> More than loving it, it&#x27;s like it just gets stuck in my head, I guess?<br>
<strong>Kazari:</strong> And, in the end, we all wound up going along with Saten-san&#x27;s search for urban legends.<br>
<strong>Mii:</strong> It&#x27;s fine, it&#x27;s fine. I don&#x27;t have anything else to take care of here either.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> Actually, it&#x27;s strange seeing you of all people coming along. What brought this on?<br>
<strong>Misaki:</strong> If I were the only one off on my own, the toji would get overly fussy about me, wouldn&#x27;t they? So. That&#x27;s. All.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> (She has a point there, but the way she said it is annoying...)<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> Thanks for coming along too, Iwakura-san, Kitora-san.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> So long as we don&#x27;t get any emergency calls, we should be fine for today.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Saten-saaan. I brought Yume-chan along to pitch in-.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I don&#x27;t really care about a tiny aradama, but you onee-sans looked like you&#x27;re having fun.<br>
<strong>Mii:</strong> This has turned into a fairly bustling group, hasn&#x27;t it.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Then, what should we do next? It might be a good idea to split into two parties.<br>
<strong>Kazari:</strong> We looked into that big discount store just now, but you don&#x27;t seem have any cans of strawberry oden or strawberry monjayaki in this world...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> We have a few differences, like this side has aradama and your side has special powers, but things are basically the same... So I thought, &quot;Maybe they&#x27;ll have it!&quot; But, no luck...<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> I thought it&#x27;d be good to split up for a bit, but Uiharu, that&#x27;s what you were looking for!?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> We were just a little morbidly curious. I wanted to know what it&#x27;d taste like.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Yeah. Uiharu-san said we just had to try it. I thought it might be tasty...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Mmm, I like strawberry daifuku and stuff a lot, but oden is going too far...<br>
<strong>Kazari:</strong> It has a highly refined flavor, you know? You can&#x27;t judge it from appearances alone.<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> No way, it&#x27;s pretty much what you&#x27;d expect!<br>
<strong>Misaki:</strong> Might if I say somethingg?<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> Don&#x27;t tell me, Shokuhou-san&#x27;s a fan of strawberry oden too!?<br>
<strong>Misaki:</strong> What are you talking about? I mean about the aradama we&#x27;re searching for, of coursee.<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> Did you come across something important?<br>
<strong>Misaki:</strong> If there were a cute aradama out there, wouldn&#x27;t it be possible lots of people might not even recognize it as an aradamaa?<br>
<strong>Mii:</strong> Now that you mention it...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> You&#x27;ve honed in on an interesting point, Shokuhou Misaki.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> So basically, there could be some kind cute small animal you wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell was an aradama!<br>
<strong>Misaki:</strong> Wasn&#x27;t that the rumor from the start? Why do you look so happy noww?<br>
<strong>Kuroko:</strong> It is Onee-sama after all... She&#x27;s surely picturing some sort of fancy aradama moving about, with an indescribable sense of excitement... What will I ever do with her.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> I-I&#x27;m not getting excited...  Can you not go making it sound weird?<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> I was only thinking, maybe there&#x27;s a cute frog looking aradama, okay!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Hmm, you like cute things, Biribiri-onee-san?<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> ...Well, I do, a little.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Then, do you like stuff like this?<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> Ooh... Hey, this is cute... Are these special mascots they only sell in this world?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> This one&#x27;s called Ichigo Daifuku Neko. It&#x27;s my favorite.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> Then, I&#x27;ll do you one better...<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> Here&#x27;s my Gekota strap!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ahh-. So that&#x27;s why you were talking about a cute frog looking aradama.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> Yep. Isn&#x27;t it cute!<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> Sorry to bust in when you&#x27;re getting all worked up over your favorite mascots, but... Could we get moving soon?<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> Y-Yeah, sure. Let&#x27;s go... Ahaha.<br>
<strong>Kazari:</strong> At any rate, we can search tomorrow for any information on sightings of strange small cute creatures.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> I think it&#x27;s a good idea to follow that line of thinking.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> (It looks like this&#x27;ll go fine without us having to do anything unnecessary to help them along. The rest just depends on Kaoru-chan&#x27;s missions.)<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> Let&#x27;s go at it hard again tomorrow!<br>
The next day--</p><p><strong>Mii:</strong> Just from asking around, it seems like there have been sightings of a small unknown creature in the area.<br>
<strong>Kuroko:</strong> On top of that, a toji was sometimes seen bringing it around. What&#x27;s going on here?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> ...Th-That sure is strange.<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> A toji together with the aradama they&#x27;re supposed to beat! That sounds kinda sorta cool, doesn&#x27;t it?<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> They say mysteries invite mysteries, but that kind of combo really heats this up.<br>
<strong>Kazari:</strong> If those are the conditions, then, instead of asking people about town, I think it&#x27;d be faster if we started asking toji.<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> Let&#x27;s head back to Renpu Girls&#x27; Academy! Since we&#x27;re getting close to the truth, I want to give a heads up to Shokuhou-san too.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Mmhm... I think that should work fine too.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Umm, Chie-san and I have something to take care of, so we&#x27;ll catch up with you later.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> That&#x27;s right. If you go from here to Renpu, you shouldn&#x27;t be in danger of getting attacked by any aradama either.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> Thanks for coming along with us, you two.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> Anyway, we&#x27;ll see you later!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Phew... I think they&#x27;re having a good time, but I feel kind of bad.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> I know... We&#x27;re conspiring with Kaoru-san and the others on the side.<br>
<strong>Misaki:</strong> ...Even so, it&#x27;s not as if you had to come all the way to get me.<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> Come on, we&#x27;re right at the end. From asking around campus, people said they just saw it here!<br>
<strong>Kazari:</strong> But, would there really be an aradama at a toji school?<br>
<strong>Mii:</strong> And also... They said that a petite toji had a strange small animal riding on her head... It&#x27;s quite the report.<br>
<strong>Kuroko:</strong> Then, an eyewitness also said they were headed toward the entranceway. For an urban legend... It&#x27;s too specific in many ways.<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> You&#x27;ve got to pin down the truth even with weird things like that, Shirai-san.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> We&#x27;ve come this far, haven&#x27;t we.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="3-a-playful-heart-and-the-rumors-truth"></a>3: A Playful Heart and the Rumor&#x27;s Truth<a class="hash-link" href="#3-a-playful-heart-and-the-rumors-truth" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Ruiko:</strong> Ah! Mashiko-san!<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> That strange thing riding on your head... Is that it!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> So you made it to the truth, huh. That was faster than I was expecting.<br>
<strong>Nene:</strong> Nenene-!<br>
<strong>Mii:</strong> The toji who got along with the aradama was you, wasn&#x27;t it, Mashiko-san.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> This little guy&#x27;s the guardian beast of the Mashiko family. We&#x27;ve been together since I was a kid.<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> Then, that means Etou-san and Yanase-san and everyone must&#x27;ve known, right? You&#x27;re close and all.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Sorry for keeping quiet about it.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> But hey, it&#x27;d feel rude just handing the answer to somebody who&#x27;s set on chasing it down.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> Saten-san was so excited to find the truth at that point, wasn&#x27;t she?<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> Well, sure-. As soon as I hear about an urban legend, I can&#x27;t help it. I get caught up in this feeling, like, &quot;Let&#x27;s do this-&quot;.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> We wanted to let you have some fun. So, we played along a little, alright?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> We knew the truth behind the rumor wasn&#x27;t going to be anything dangerous either.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I was the first to spur you on. I was telling the truth when I said I was interested in the aradama of the Mashiko family, but I&#x27;m sorry to instigate you like that.<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> Nah, you don&#x27;t have to worry about it. It was a lot of fun.<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> And, if you&#x27;d just told me the truth straight away, I don&#x27;t think I would have felt that excitement of getting to the bottom of this.<br>
<strong>Misaki:</strong> I only went along with you for a little, but it wasn&#x27;t such a bad way of killing time, was it?<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> For sure. I got to experience all sorts of things while we were investigating too.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> That&#x27;s all we wanted to hear. Right?<br>
<strong>Nene:</strong> Ne~~.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> It doesn&#x27;t look like how I pictured it, but... This is cute too... I want touch it.<br>
<strong>Kaoruko:</strong> In a sense, your reaction was just as I pictured, Onee-sama...<br>
<strong>Kazari:</strong> What&#x27;s this little guy&#x27;s name?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> It&#x27;s Nene.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Cases of aradama such as Nene are exceptionally rare, so I&#x27;d say none outside of Mashiko Kaoru&#x27;s acquaintances would believe it. In actuality, Nene has in part become a rumor.<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> This guy sure is nothing at all like the aradama we&#x27;ve seen so far. Let me pet him.<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> --Eh, he jumped!?<br>
<strong>Mii:</strong> KYA. Th-That took me by surprise. It&#x27;s a good thing I caught him at least.<br>
<strong>Nene:</strong> Ne~!<br>
<strong>Kuroko:</strong> This is... He seems to be somehow attached to you, Konori-senpai.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> You&#x27;re so lucky, Konori-senpai...<br>
<strong>Mii:</strong> I&#x27;m not quite sure why that is myself.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> C-Can I try hugging him too? Nene-cha...<br>
<strong>Nene:</strong> Nene~!<br>
<strong>Misaki:</strong> Honestly, what&#x27;s with this little guyy... Head on over to Misaka-san already.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Well-, that&#x27;s just how he is.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> I thought things might turn out this way, when Nene-chan came in touch with Konori-san and Shokuhou-san...<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Ahaha...<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> Ah-. Does that mean, Nene-chan&#x27;s...<br>
<strong>Misaki:</strong> Basicallyy, does that mean he&#x27;s more attached to girls with bigger bust power? How unfortunate for youu, Misaka-san.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> ...!?!?<br>
<strong>Kuroko:</strong> Now, now. Onee-sama, you still have me as your partner in skinship. Please love and caress me to your heart&#x27;s desire.<br>
<strong>Kazari:</strong> Ahaha... It might cause other problems, but it&#x27;d be nice if the other aradama could all be as friendly as Nene-chan here.<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> Yeah. I think it&#x27;d be best if they got along like Mashiko-san and Nene-chan here.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> That&#x27;s for sure.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Hopefully things could end up like that someday.<br>
<strong>Mii:</strong> By the way, is there any way of getting along better with Nene-chan?<br>
<strong>Ruiko:</strong> I wanna know!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Fine, I guess we can try some things out-. It&#x27;s not like he doesn&#x27;t like you or anything, Mikoto.<br>
<strong>Mikoto:</strong> !<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Nene, c&#x27;mere for a sec.<br>
<strong>Nene:</strong> Nene~.</p></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="theme-doc-footer-edit-meta-row row"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations/edit/docs/Rumored_Urban_Legend_Watching.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="theme-edit-this-page"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_2_ui" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_13-_"></div></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"></div></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_35-E thin-scrollbar"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#1-aradama-and-a-strange-rumor" class="table-of-contents__link">1: Aradama and a Strange Rumor</a></li><li><a href="#2-chasing-urban-legends" class="table-of-contents__link">2: Chasing Urban Legends</a></li><li><a href="#3-a-playful-heart-and-the-rumors-truth" class="table-of-contents__link">3: A Playful Heart and the Rumor&#39;s Truth</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Links</div><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://pastebin.com/LdyviZ8Z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Translator anon&#x27;s pastebin<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Site source code<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Built with Docusaurus.</div></div></div></footer></div>
