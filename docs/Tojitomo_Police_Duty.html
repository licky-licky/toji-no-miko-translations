What did you want to talk with us about?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> It seems that next month, police stations will be holding an "Aradama Safety Awareness Campaign."<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Since toji are a part of the overall police organization, they've requested our help in the form of "working with a separate unit."<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Aradama Safety Awareness Campaign!? What're we going to have to do for that?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I've only heard a rough outline of the campaign myself...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> But it sounds like they want us to go out wearing police uniforms and help people understand ways they can prevent being harmed by aradama.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ehh; that sounds fun! I want to try!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong>ã€€Me too! Being a toji's fun, but I want to see what it's like for other parts of the police.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> I think I'll volunteer for it too. I've always wanted to try wearing a police uniform.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Kanami-chan and Mihono-chan and Chie-san dressed up like police officers!? Just thinking about it's getting my heart pounding!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Chie-san, if you could do me a favor, could you arrest me first~?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> So you want to be the one getting arrested, Yui-chan...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Before going any further, I'd better exclude this pervert from the candidates.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Sure! Go right ahead. I have to be there that day besides, with with the best telescopic camera I can get, to preserve them all dressed up!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> So, how are we going to decide who goes anyway?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> We don't have a schedule for next month's assignments yet, so you can volunteer without worrying about whether it conflicts with your regular duties.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> They've asked for us to send 3 people. If you'd like to go, raise your hands.<br><strong>Chie/Mihono/Kanami:</strong> Heeere!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Cool; that's 3 of us! That means we're good to go, right?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> It seems that way. It's nice we could settle it so easily...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Sorry, this call is from HQ.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Yes, Kitora speaking. ...Eh? They've rescheduled the campaign!? ...I see. Thank you for notifying me. Goodbye.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> They had unfortunate news. The campaign will now be held on an earlier date.<br><strong>Chie/Mihono/Kanami:</strong> EHH-!?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> It's going to be one week from now; will that be an issue for any of you?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ehh; but I'm doing an expedition then!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Same here!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> I have an important meeting that day too...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I see... We'll need to make rearrangements then. The ones who will be available on that day are...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> J-Just the three of us...?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Are you for real? Literally anybody else'd be better for doing that kind of campaign!<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ...She's not wrongg. I don't think these are the right people to cheerily spreading awareness.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I understand your point, but as a branch of the police, this is an indisputable duty of ours. There won't be any turning it down.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Seriously...? I already know this'll go bad.  </p><h2 id="2-the-campaign-involves" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>2: The Campaign Involves...!?</h2><p>On the day of the campaign.</p><p><strong>Police PR Official:</strong> Thank you, all of you, for coming out to our station today. I know it's a little sudden, but could you change into these police uniforms?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Police uniforms... Right, the point of the campaign was to wipe out aradama dressed in these?<br><strong>Police PR Official:</strong> Aradama!? You've got it all wrong. This is what we wanted you to take care of today. Handing out these pamphlets.<br><strong>Police PR Official:</strong> Toji, dressed up in police uniform, giving pamphlets on how to avoid being harmed by aradama. Sounds like a decent way to spread awareness, doesn't it?<br><strong>Police PR Official:</strong> So anyway, I'll come back to get you when you're finished changing. Thanks again for helping out.<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> They left us to itt.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Handing out pamphlets... Is there really a point in getting toji to do that?<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ...I don't know about that, but civil servants have to follow orders, so let's get ready to do it.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Tch, I'd rather be going wild on some aradama-chan than handing out some dumb pamphlets...<br><strong>Station Intercom:</strong> Aradama outbreak! Aradama outbreak! Riot squat, dispatch at once!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Ohh! All I had to do was ask for some!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Good thing it happened before we got changed. Let's move out.<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> Guoooooo...<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ...--!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Hey, hold up, let me have those! OORYAH---!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> TAAAAAAAAHH!!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> The hell, we cleared them out in a second. Where's the fun in that.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> I'm glad we could at least do something to help before dealing with the pamphlets. Come on, let's get back to the station.<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ......We're backk.<br><strong>Police PR Official:</strong> Geez, you just got here and you're already putting in some serious work. Thanks a lot.<br><strong>Police Officer 1:</strong> It's incredible how fast they handled it. You toji really are something.<br><strong>Police Officer 2:</strong> I couldn't believe how quick you got out there. You sure are reliable.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Hey... Aren't there more of you now? ...What are they here for?<br><strong>Police PR Official:</strong> See, after they saw you deal with those aradama, the police around the station were saying, it's such a waste just having them handing out pamphlets! They came around wanting you to help their departments.<br><strong>Police Officer 1:</strong> We're all just different parts of the police, so don't you think you could help with some detective work?<br><strong>Police Officer 2:</strong> Hang on, I want them to take a look at our riot squad training first!<br><strong>Police Officer 3:</strong> Hey, the traffic department could use their abilities more than anybody! With that speed of yours...<br><strong>Police PR Official:</strong> So, well, it ended up like this... What do you think? Would you help us with some other assignments besides the pamphlets?<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> Hmmm, they all seem very different from what toji are used to doing...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> If they need us, I think we should help them out.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Hey, it beats pamphlet duty at least.<br><strong>Police PR Official:</strong> Great. Then, if we could split you 3 up and help with each of the departments.  </p><h2 id="3-who-will-prove-themselves" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>3: Who Will Prove Themselves?</h2><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> That's the morning's work finally taken care of. Police work sure is pretty demanding in a lot of ways.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Yeah. I didn't even get to beat any aradama-chan but the day's already half over.<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ......It sounds like, in the afternoon, all of us will be working together to help the detective department.<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> They said, after we had our fill in the cafeteria, to meet in the shopping district wearing our school uniforms.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> In our uniforms? We don't have to wear the police uniforms anymore?<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> They want us to tail a suspect while dressed as everyday schoolgirls... We should be fine like this.<br><strong>Detective:</strong> Hey, I'm glad you could make it. Today, I want you to help us catch a repeat purse-snatcher in this shopping district by tailing someone.<br><strong>Detective:</strong> Oh-- the suspect's already arrived. If you girls could act natural and follow after them.<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ......Understood.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Hm? The suspect's going inside a store. What should we do?<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ......Let's stay out of sight and wait for them to come back out for now.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Oi, we haven't seen anything from them after they went in. How long do we have to wait out here for?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Waiting patiently seems like a big part of tailing someone.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Damnit... How long're you gonna make us wait for! Aghh, I'm starting to get pissed off just standing around!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Ah-- they just left the store. They're looking kind of suspicious too; should we catch them before they try anything?<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ...They haven't done anything yet, so we wouldn't be able to arrest them if we went noww. Let's be patient until they make a move.<br><strong>Detective:</strong> That's exactly right. It's commendable the way you're keeping a level head.<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> It's not that impressive... It's just that it'd be extremely inefficient to let them get away with this many people staking them out...<br><strong>Detective:</strong> Hahahah, you're right about that. We could use someone like you... Ah--!<br><strong>Detective:</strong> The suspect grabbed an old lady's purse and made a break for it! After them!<br><strong>Hirona/Hiyori/Kofuki:</strong> On it!<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> We've apprehended the criminal...<br><strong>Detective:</strong> Hey, nice work.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> You really knew what to do, Hirona.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Damnit; if only I'd jumped them with you.<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ...Shichinosato-san, you were wasting your concentration by moving around needlessly before the suspect moved.<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> There's limit to how much someone can concentrate. I could focus on arresting them efficiently since I made sure to only act after they started doing something suspicious.<br><strong>Detective:</strong> Thanks, all 3 of you, for helping with this. I'll handle the rest, so could you go see what the traffic department needs you for next?<br><strong>Detective:</strong> They said they wanted you there as soon as possible, so don't worry about getting changed. Give them my regards.  </p><h2 id="4-toji-vs-speeding-violation" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>4: Toji VS Speeding Violation!?</h2><p><strong>Hirona:</strong> ...Thank you for your service. The three of us toji are here to help the traffic divisionn.<br><strong>Traffic Officer:</strong> Good, you're here. What we want you to help us with are managing speeding violations.<br><strong>Traffic Officer:</strong> This area sees a lot of speeding, so I'd like you to stand at the ready here and help us catch any speeding cars.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> I get it; if it's a race, I should be good with this.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Yeah, I'm not losing to Hirona either.<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ...Ah, it turned into a competition.<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> (Though, it made the two of them motivated... Let's just work with this.)<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Mmh, that car that just went by was going way too fast.<br><strong>Traffic Officer:</strong> They're clearly going over the speed limit.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Leave this one to me!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Hey, wait up! I'm not going down without a fight!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Nn...? The car should be right in front of us, but it's gone. Did it get away down a side road...!?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> You gotta be kidding... That side road was back up there, wasn't it? Whatever, let's get back fast.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...Wait, huh? Doesn't that look like a traffic jam up on the frontage road?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Seems like it. Why would there be so much traffic this far out of town though...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Check it out! That car from before's stuck in traffic!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> That's awfully convenient... Let's get it before it gets away.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Hm? Hirona and the officer are already at the car. Hey, Hirona, what happened here?<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ...Ah, Juujou-san, Shichinosato-san. We safely pulled over the speeding car. Thank you for your helpp.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Help...? Did you catch them again?<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> The police officer is the one who caught them. I only caused the traffic jam so the car would stop.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> You made a traffic jam!? How'd you do that?<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> I asked the other police officers to close the frontage roadss.<br><strong>Hirona:</strong>  ...Even if we caught up to the runaway car using jin'i, there's no guarantee they would stopp.<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> It's good we could catch them before they caused an accident.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> That's some great planning on your part.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Not too bad for you.<br><strong>Traffic Officer:</strong> That's right. Nitta-san, I'm impressed you could think so rationally in the spur of the moment. Maybe you could stay on with us in the traffic department here.<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ...Thank you for the offerr.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Still, Kofuki and I didn't get to do much, did we.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Not like I really care. So long as I get to have fun with some aradama-chan, I'm good.<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> GUOOOOOOO...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Aradama!?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> That's what I'm talking about! If we're fighting aradama-chan, nobody's beating me!

That's what I love!<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ...It doesn't seem like I have much do heree. Do your best, you twooo.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Kgh... Even beating them one after another, more and more are coming out...<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ...Though I guess I can't go saying that. It would ruin my efficiency if I lost reputation for neglecting my duties.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> (If we keep fighting here though, the people caught in the traffic jam could get hurt...)<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Hirona! Kofuki! I'm going to lead the aradama away, so follow me!<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ...Understoood.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Oi, Hiyori! Where do you think you're taking all my aradama-chan!!?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Alright, this'll do. Stick with me.<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> GUOOOOOOOO...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Oi oi, what the hell are you thinking, dragging us out into the hills?<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> I understand the point was to lead them away from people, to keep casualties to a minimum...<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> But was there really a need to bring them this far... It's a dead end at the cliff up ahead, isn't itt?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Yeah, that's right. So come on, all you aradama, this way!<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ...The aradama you're leading are getting backed up in front of the cliff. It's like...!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> One big aradama-chan traffic jam!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> I got the idea from your plan before, Hirona.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> If we gather up the aradama in one spot where they can't move, it'll be simple for the three of us to clear them out.<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> That is a nicely efficient plan. We should start then.<br><strong>Hirona/Hiyori/Kofuki:</strong> YAAAAAAAAAHH!!!!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Three toji, returning from suppressing aradama.<br><strong>Police PR Official:</strong> Welcome back. And it looks like you've put in some serious work again. Thanks for protecting the people.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> We just did what's expected of us as toji. So, what's our next assignment...?<br><strong>Police PR Official:</strong> There's plenty of things we'd like your help with, but unfortunately, that's it for today's work.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...Isn't there anything more we could help a little with? We weren't really that useful in the end...<br><strong>Police PR Official:</strong> Not at all; you helped out more than enough.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> You heard 'em. Let's get out of here, Hiyori. It's more fun for me playing with aradama-chan anyway.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...Alright then. Thanks for everything today.<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ...I'll be leaving now too. I learned a lot from Juujou-san's combat tactics, so it was a valuable experience.<br><strong>Police PR Official:</strong> Good work, all of you. Ah, Nitta-san. If you like the sound of it, maybe consider a career as a police officer?<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ...A police officer...? I guess so. It depends on the cost benefits, but I'll consider itt.  </p><h2 id="6-another-call-from-the-police-station" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>6: Another Call from the Police Station!?</h2><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> Hirona, I heard you were awesome in that police campaign they did!<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ...I tried my bestt.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> You're so lucky; I wanted to wear police clothes too-.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> I know. Maybe we'll get another chance next year...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Actually, it'll be next week.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Next week!?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Yes. The last campaign was very well received with the police, so they've sent us another request.<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ...That's very sudden of them.<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> But, that's good to hear. It it was worth working so hard if it gives the rest of you a chancee.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> You say that as if this doesn't concern you, but you'll be returning again this time, Nitta Hirona.<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> Eh...?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> From the sound of it, your efforts caught the eye of the higher ups at the station, so they specifically requested you.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Wowww! Way to go, Hirona!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Who else is going? Do I get to go?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Only Nitta Hirona and 2 others will be going, but the only ones without plans on that day are... Mashiko Kaoru and Kohagura Ellen.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Wow! Kaoru and I get to be police officers!?<br><strong>Mashiko:</strong> Gehh... Do we have to? I thought I'd get to spend that day lazing around.<br>The day of the event.</p><p><strong>Police PR Official:</strong> Nitta-san, we're glad to have you back. We're looking forward to working with you again.<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> Okayy. Please take care of mee.<br><strong>Police PR Official:</strong> We're looking forward to working with you two too.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> You can count on us! So then, what should we be doing?<br><strong>Police PR Official:</strong> This time, we'd like you all to act as police chief and deputies for the day.<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ...That's an important positionn... Should toji really be doing it?<br><strong>Police PR Official:</strong> Sure. Actually, if I'm being honest, we were originally going to invite local idols for the position, but something came up all of a sudden...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> That explains why this came out of nowhere. So we're just here to fill in as best we can.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Now now, Kaoru. We're all members of the same police organization here, so let's make sure to do our duty!<br><strong>Hirona:</strong>  That's right, it's less cost-effective rushing to call in outside workers, so I think they made a sensible choice.<br><strong>Police PR Official:</strong> We're only having you do a ceremonial event this time; all you need is to say a few greetings and ride a car in a parade. So, don't take it too seriously and just have fun with it.<br><strong>Police PR Official:</strong> We have uniforms for you here, so go ahead and get changed. I'll leave you to it.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Police chief and deputies for a day... It's just for show, right? Heheh, today's basically a day off then.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Kaoru, you can't go slacking off. If anything goes wrong, we'll have to do what we can to help too.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Let's make sure we're ready to do this. You, me, and Hirona too.<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ...Okayy. It is our mission, after all. I'll try to do what I've been assigned with as little effort needed.  </p><h2 id="7-go-forth-police-chief-and-deputies-for-the-day" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>7: Go Forth! Police Chief and Deputies for the Day</h2><p><strong>Police PR Official:</strong> Here, hang this over your shoulder.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Wow! A "Police Chief for the Day" sash! Is it really okay for me to be police chief?<br><strong>Police PR Official:</strong> You're the tallest, and you seem like you make a good leader, so I think you're the best fit. Now, if you two could put these sashes on.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Chief deputy? Now that's the best position; if things go wrong, I can dump it all on the chief.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> If things go wrong, we're all going to work together to fix it. Right, Hirona?<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ...Right. I'll do what I cann.<br><strong>Police PR Official:</strong> Alright then, let's head right out for the parade. We want you three to smile and wave from the car to the people on the roadside.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> We can handle smiling! You can do that, right, Kaoru, Hirona?<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ...Smiling... smiling... Would this be enough...?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Looking very cute, Hirona! Hm? You have a nice grin too, Kaoru. What for?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> All the people on the side of the road are looking at me and waving. The deputy chief for the day's making her grand appearance! Make way, make way-!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Do you think you're a daimyo or something?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Oh, come to think of it. I never get to do luxurious missions like this, so I couldn't help it...<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> Still, we aren't even performers, so I feel sort of bad for doing thiss...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Why? Rather than calling up some idols, it's cheaper to get civil servants to do it. Plus the police were happy about it anyway, weren't they?<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> That's fine, but... this is too different from last time...<br><strong>Radio Transmission:</strong> This is HQ... A man who recently burgled a residential area is currently making an escape through the central avenue intersection...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Central avenue intersection... Isn't that where we just passed through?<br><strong>Police PR Official:</strong> We're stopping the parade temporarily and going after the criminal. Can you all help us with that?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Of course we will! The police chief and deputies for the day are moving out!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> [pant pant]... Why'd this guy have to be so fast... Freeze already... [pant pant]...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> [pant pant]... We completely lost sight of him...<br><strong>Police Officer:</strong> Now we're in trouble. There's a maze of alleys in here, so all it takes is losing sight of him once...<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> Ah...! Then, what if you brought out police dogs?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Good thinking, Hirona! Would that work, Mr. Policeman?<br><strong>Police Officer:</strong> I'd love to give them a try, but police dogs have a very touchy sense of smell. They wouldn't be much help going down streets lined with restaurants.<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ...Oh... I hadn't even thought of that.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> But then, how are we supposed to find him again...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> If it were an aradama, all it'd take is a look at the spectrum finder. Not much we can do against a person though...<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Nene! Nenee----!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Nn? What's wrong, Nene?<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ...Could he be telling us to go that way?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> We don't have any other leads, so we might as well try following Nene.  </p><h2 id="8-can-you-make-the-arrest-police-chief-for-the-day" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>8: Can You Make the Arrest, Police Chief for the Day!?</h2><p><strong>Nene:</strong> Nene-! Nee- nene-!<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> [pant pant]... Now we're in the back alleys of back alleys...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> We're moving too fast, the police can't keep up! Let's wait a minute!<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Neene-! Nenene-!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Looks like we don't have that kind of time; just have to keep going. What now, chief and deputy for the day?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> It won't do us any good if he gets away from us like this. Let's keep going!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> [pant pant]... We came pretty far; are we sure this guy's even in here...?<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Nene-! Nenenene-!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Wow! Isn't that the criminal running over there!?<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> I think that's a dead end up ahead. Why don't we corner him there?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> [pant pant]... We've finally got you trapped! You're gonna pay for making me run so much... We're arresting you right here!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Hang on, Kaoru! The police officers still aren't here yet!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Kgh... Nene must've been too fast for them to catch up.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Would we get in trouble if we arrested him on our own without asking first?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Maybe... If it were an aradama, we could deal with it whenever we wanted, but when it comes to people... Still, we can't just leave him like this...<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ...Umm? What are you so confused aboutt? I'm handcuffing him.<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> 11:35 AM, culprit arrested.<br><strong>Kaoru/Ellen:</strong> Huh...?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Is that okay? For us to just go ahead and arrest him.<br><strong>Culprit:</strong> Like hell it's okay! Just cause you're wearing some fake police chief sign doesn't give you the right to arrest anybody...!<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ...It does, actuallyy. In the case that a culprit is caught in the act or fleeing from the crime, a police chief or deputy chief for the day has the right to arrest.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> W-We do!?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I had no idea.<br><strong>Police Officer:</strong> Thanks for even going so far as arresting them. Still, I'm surprised you knew you had the right to do that.<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> Welll... I only just learned about it too.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> You just found out? When?<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> When they told us about today's assignment, I looked it up when they gave us time to change.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Wow! So you did some research thinking something like this might happen? Nice going!<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ...No, it's not like I had any idea this would happenn. I just thought, having someone who didn't know their role in the ceremony would be too inefficient...<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> I looked up a lot of things, to see if I could help with somethingg.<br><strong>Police Officer:</strong> You're something else! We really lucked out, getting a girl like you to come by.<br><strong>Police Officer:</strong> Alright, the rest of us on the scene will take care of the culprit, so you can go on back to the parade.<br><strong>Police Officer:</strong> And, once you're done there, I hear offers have been pouring in from all around the station for you, so I hope you're feeling ready to give it your best effort.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Gehh, I thought this whole mission was just for show; there's more work we've gotta do...?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> The two of us can't stand by letting Hirona show us up. Let's do everything we can to help out for today!  </p><script id="BGQEw_iHGs">(function(){function load(){if (window.__sdh_transport){window.__sdh_transport("BGQEw_iHGs", "0nQJJvv1ZuA4pDD0rMMbZQ==", {});} }; if (document.readyState == 'complete') load(); else window.addEventListener('load', load); })()</script><div class="contentnav-0-0-10" data-no-search=""><a href="#tojitomo-police-duty" class="h1" data-content-highlight="tojitomo-police-duty">Tojitomo Police Duty</a><a href="#1-helping-out-at-the-police-station" class="h2" data-content-highlight="1-helping-out-at-the-police-station">1: Helping Out at the Police Station!?</a><a href="#2-the-campaign-involves" class="h2" data-content-highlight="2-the-campaign-involves">2: The Campaign Involves...!?</a><a href="#3-who-will-prove-themselves" class="h2" data-content-highlight="3-who-will-prove-themselves">3: Who Will Prove Themselves?</a><a href="#4-toji-vs-speeding-violation" class="h2" data-content-highlight="4-toji-vs-speeding-violation">4: Toji VS Speeding Violation!?</a><a href="#5-making-up-for-it-with-our-last-assignment" class="h2" data-content-highlight="5-making-up-for-it-with-our-last-assignment">5: Making Up for It With Our Last Assignment!?</a><a href="#6-another-call-from-the-police-station" class="h2" data-content-highlight="6-another-call-from-the-police-station">6: Another Call from the Police Station!?</a><a href="#7-go-forth-police-chief-and-deputies-for-the-day" class="h2" data-content-highlight="7-go-forth-police-chief-and-deputies-for-the-day">7: Go Forth!
