Its main attraction: a dance performed in miko attire by eleven select toji.<br>
This year, the girls chosen were as follows: Shidou Maki, Konohana Suzuka, Satuki Yomi, Tsubakuro Yume, Etou Kanami, Yanase Mai, Juujou Hiyori, Mashiko Kaoru, Kitora Mirja, Yamashiro Yui, and Shichinosato Kofuki--  </p><p><strong>Maki:</strong> We&#x27;re going to do a full rehearsal of the performance now. Ban Tsugumi, you&#x27;re in charge of the music.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Right, you can leave the supporting role to me. Ready... Starting the music.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Three, two, one...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> That&#x27;s wrong, all wrong! Ban Tsugumi, stop the music! Yume, Mashiko Kaoru, Shichinosato Kofuki!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> You weren&#x27;t keeping the pace! We&#x27;re starting again, from the top!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh~, againnn? I&#x27;m bored of this already~.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> I thought I&#x27;d get a break from dealing with aradama here, but this might be worse...<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Hey, how long&#x27;re we gonna keep doing this for? Isn&#x27;t this good enough already?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Until you can deliver a perfect performance for Yukari-sama, of course.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> That&#x27;s the entire purpose of this training camp. Now, let&#x27;s keep going...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Wait, Maki-san. It&#x27;s about time we gave them a break.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Hooray-! A break-!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Hold it, Yume! I didn&#x27;t say we were taking a break yet!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Suzuka! They still have a long way to go before they&#x27;re ready! Do you think we have time to stop now!?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> That&#x27;s exactly why we should.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> This training camp will last quite some time. They&#x27;ll need a degree of rest every now and then, won&#x27;t they?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> But...<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> We&#x27;ll still be practicing tomorrow, won&#x27;t we? Let us rest a minute.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> That&#x27;s not your place to decide...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ...Maybe I have been pushing you too hard though.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> We&#x27;re taking a break, everyone. You can all rest until Yume, Mashiko Kaoru, and Shichinosato Kofuki can manage that performance.<br>
<strong>Kaoru/Kofuki/Yume:</strong> Ehh~!?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ahh, I&#x27;m worn out-.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> We&#x27;ve been dancing all this time, after all.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Maybe it&#x27;s because we&#x27;re using different muscles than usual, but I&#x27;m feeling a lot more tired than I expected.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> This seemed likely to happen, so we do have honey lemon slices prepared. Would you all like some?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Honey lemon slices... That would be nice.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Thank you, Kitora-san!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Yamashiro Yui, please hand them out.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I&#x27;m on it, Mirja-san!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> You can eat these soury sweet honeyed lemons right out of my hands! And you can lick my fingers clean too if you want!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Stop that, it&#x27;s unsanitary.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Haha... Thank you, Kitora-san. I can make another batch for everyone tomorrow.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Good, I&#x27;ll tell Ban Tsugumi that she won&#x27;t need to make any more.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Nn~! Sweet and sour... And bitter!? Eh!? Why&#x27;s it so bitter!?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> What&#x27;s this powder mixed in with the honey!? Though... I feel like dancing now!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> ...I think I won&#x27;t eat any after all.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> ...That may be for the best.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Tsubakuro-san, you are moving your hands incorrectly. Mashiko-san, your body has stopped moving. Shichinosato-san, please do not try to fall asleep.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...The training camp has only just begun and we&#x27;re already behind schedule.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I didn&#x27;t expect it to be such a struggle. There are lots of minor points they aren&#x27;t able to keep up with, but...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> It&#x27;s the finishing act, isn&#x27;t it.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> As toji, they should all be skilled enough for this.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> And despite that, for them to be this this incapable of coordinating their performance...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> We still have time before the recital. I&#x27;d like to believe they can work things out with enough practice.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Why now, at a time like this...<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Shidou-san, there&#x27;s a report of an aradama outbreak in the area...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> We&#x27;ll all go. You&#x27;ll join us, Ban Tsugumi.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> That&#x27;s fine, but it&#x27;s best if we go quickly. Tsubakuro-san and Shichinosato-san have already rushed on ahead.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Nice timing back there, aradama-chan! I love you for real-!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I&#x27;m glad we got to leave practice, but these are all weaklings, so it&#x27;s still boring!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> ...By the way, Onee-san. Where are we?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Beats me? All I cared about was chasing down the aradama-chan, so I wasn&#x27;t paying attention.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh-!? You&#x27;re no help at all.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Playing with aradama-chan was bound to be a million times more fun than that lameass dance practice.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ...Found you! Don&#x27;t go running off on your own!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Is this a theater? Was there a theater this close nearby?<br>
<strong>Giraffe:</strong> I understand.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Wah-!? A talking giraffe!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Is that an aradama too? Should I cut it up to be sure?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Please wait, Shichinosato-san. I&#x27;ve never seen an aradama with such a close resemblance to a giraffe before.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> We should attempt to gather information on it through communication first. You can cut it up when we&#x27;re done.<br>
<strong>Giraffe:</strong> I am not an aradama, so may I ask you toji not to cut me.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> It knows what we are?<br>
<strong>Giraffe:</strong> Yes.<br>
<strong>Giraffe:</strong> I wish for you to suppress the aradama, so the audition may resume.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="2-could-this-be-another-world"></a>2: ...Could This Be Another World?<a class="hash-link" href="#2-could-this-be-another-world" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Maki:</strong> All aradama in the area have been defeated. Suzuka, is the spectrum finder showing you anything?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...No, that should have been all of them just now. However...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Suzuka? Is something wrong?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> It&#x27;s not giving any response, Shidou-san. After entering this theater, the spectrum finder didn&#x27;t react to the aradama at all.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ...They didn&#x27;t show up on the spectrum finders?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Yes, this is a highly fascinating phenomenon!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Could they be a new variety of aradama? Though, the structure of their bodies was familiar. Which might mean, the aradama have evolved in some way...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Get a hold of yourself, Ban Tsugumi. ...Suzuka, is what she said accurate?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yes, I&#x27;ve confirmed it myself. Ban-san is telling the truth.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> So what&#x27;s going on here...?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Maki-onee-san! Somebody&#x27;s fighting some aradama over there!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Grh, they just keep coming... Move in to help!<br>
<strong>??? (Karen):</strong> YAAAAAAAHH!!<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> Gyaa...<br>
<strong>??? (Mahiru):</strong> Wh-What&#x27;s going on here!?<br>
<strong>??? (Hikari):</strong> Think about that later. HAA!!<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> GYAAA!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ehhh!?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> They&#x27;re killing aradama without okatana!?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> And they&#x27;re so cute to boot!?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> (As it seems, these are not ordinary aradama here... No, that&#x27;s not what matters most now.)<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> This is no time for you to fool around, Yamashiro Yui! Move to support those girls!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> I dunno who you are, but hands off my aradama-chan!!<br>
<strong>??? (Karen):</strong> Thanks for the help! Those monster looking things came out of nowhere, and we didn&#x27;t know what to do!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> We were just doing our job. We&#x27;re toji, after all.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> And anyway, how&#x27;d you beat the aradama!? That&#x27;s not an okatana, right!?<br>
<strong>??? (Karen):</strong> Otakara? [treasure]<br>
<strong>??? (Nana):</strong> Not treasure, Karen-chan. She said an &quot;okatana&quot;.<br>
<strong>??? (Juuna):</strong> An okatana... Some type of sword? Like the ones you have, right?<br>
<strong>??? (Karen):</strong> Banana! And Junjun too!<br>
<strong>??? (Mahiru):</strong> Hey, Karen-chan... These girls, they might have something to do with what&#x27;s happening...<br>
<strong>??? (Hikari):</strong> I think so too.<br>
<strong>??? (Karen):</strong> But, since they&#x27;re here, that makes them stage girls like us!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> ...&quot;Stage girls&quot;?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Like performers? Does anyone know about them?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Nope, not me.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> What about you, Mai-chan?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> No, I haven&#x27;t heard about them either.<br>
<strong>??? (Juuna):</strong> We&#x27;re students of Seisho Music Academy. You&#x27;ve heard of that, right?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Seisho Music Academy? Do you know about it, onee-sans?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> No, I&#x27;ve never heard of it.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I should be familiar with prestigious music academies, from socializing in those circles...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> But the name Seisho Music Academy doesn&#x27;t ring any bells.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Maybe it&#x27;s not all that prestigious?<br>
<strong>??? (Maya):</strong> I&#x27;m not about to let that comment pass.<br>
<strong>Karen:</strong> There&#x27;s no Starlight-!?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> What do you mean aradama don&#x27;t exist!?<br>
<strong>Claudine:</strong> So, if I&#x27;m understanding this correctly, these girls came from another world?<br>
<strong>Kaoruko:</strong> Could something out of a fairytale like that happen?<br>
<strong>Futaba:</strong> You fought them yourself, didn&#x27;t you, Kaoruko? Those, aradama, you called them?<br>
<strong>Kaoruko:</strong> ...It might have actually happened after all...<br>
<strong>Kaoruko:</strong> Which all works out then.<br>
<strong>Kaoruko:</strong> We&#x27;ve been in a pickle. The audition was suspended thanks to these aradama. Could you defeat them for us?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Audition...? I haven&#x27;t seen any judges here.<br>
<strong>Juuna:</strong> It&#x27;s called an audition, but it isn&#x27;t like any ordinary audition you&#x27;re thinking of.<br>
<strong>Juuna:</strong> Stage girls fight amongst each other, aiming to be the top star.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Hmmm. Well, you don&#x27;t have to ask. I&#x27;ll get all the aradama-chan myself.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Shichinosato Kofuki is right. Defeating aradama is our duty as toji.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Duty&#x27;s great and all, but... If we beat them all, is that gonna send us back to our world?<br>
<strong>Maya:</strong> I believe things will work out.<br>
<strong>Maya:</strong> The giraffe asked for you to suppress the aradama. So, once they are all suppressed, he should send you back.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Then there shouldn&#x27;t be a problem. You can leave suppressing the aradama to us.<br>
<strong>Karen:</strong> ...But, is it really okay for us to make Shidou-san and them do all the work?<br>
<strong>Mahiru:</strong> I feel the same way. It&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s the toji&#x27;s fault the aradama are here...<br>
<strong>Hikari:</strong> Besides, this is our audition.<br>
<strong>Maya:</strong> Which leaves us only one option: we will help suppress the aradama too.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> But, it&#x27;s dangerous!<br>
<strong>Maya:</strong> Despite not being toji, we can defeat these aradama, can&#x27;t we? There should be no issue then.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="3-a-shared-resemblance"></a>3: A Shared Resemblance<a class="hash-link" href="#3-a-shared-resemblance" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Shichinosato-san, there&#x27;s aradama on our 9 o&#x27;clock. Did you notice them?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> The hell, what is this place, aradama-chan heaven!? Bring it on! Just try and keep up!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Don&#x27;t mind me; go all out.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Look at them go-. At this point, can&#x27;t we just leave everything to those two?<br>
<strong>Nene:</strong> Nene!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> You know we can&#x27;t do that! So long as aradama are here, they&#x27;re causing problems for Karen-chan and the others!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> That&#x27;s right, Kaoru-chan.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> And besides, if we don&#x27;t get back soon... I&#x27;m sure Sayaka-chan and the others will be worried sick.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Worried, huh...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...You&#x27;re losing focus, Maki-san.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Does it look that way?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> There&#x27;s no other way of looking at it. Wouldn&#x27;t you ordinarily be leading the charge against the aradama?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> But there are three concerns causing you to falter. Will we be able to go home? How is Yukari-sama reacting to this?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> And also... about the dance performance.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ...I can&#x27;t hide anything from you, can I.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I&#x27;m simply worried about the same things you are.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Since we have this opportunity, I&#x27;d like to ask these girls for their opinions on our performance. What do you think?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Ask them?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yes. Their lives revolve around the stage, don&#x27;t they? They should be able to offer us valuable insights.<br>
<strong>Maya:</strong> The closing act of your dance isn&#x27;t coming along well?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> That&#x27;s right. Aside from the very end, we can bring it together with few mistakes.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> But, no matter how many times we rehearse it, we never manage to synchronize the end.<br>
<strong>Maya:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Claudine:</strong> It isn&#x27;t as if your bodies stop moving, is it?<br>
<strong>Claudine:</strong> From watching you fight with the aradama, each of you should have more than enough basic physical fitness, so all that&#x27;s left is for you to practice.<br>
<strong>Maya:</strong> ...Are they not losing sight of their direction?<br>
<strong>Claudine:</strong> What do you mean by that?<br>
<strong>Maya:</strong> Assuming the toji are also special students, there isn&#x27;t a chance they would receive an utterly useless curriculum.<br>
<strong>Maya:</strong> In which case, their dance must also be treated as an extension of their everyday life.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> An extension of our usual life...<br>
<strong>Maya:</strong> That&#x27;s right. Shidou-san, you&#x27;ve been attempting to deviate from your ordinary selves, have you not?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ...You&#x27;ve hit the nail on the head, Tendou Maya.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> In focusing too heavily on acting as miko for our dance, we&#x27;ve lost sight of being toji.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ...A theater pro really does see things differently. I&#x27;m glad I asked you.<br>
<strong>Claudine:</strong> I could have told you that much...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> (As expected, Tendou-san made a convincing argument. Though... I wonder what has Saijou-san looking so bothered?)<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> (Her hostile attitude toward Tendou-san seems somewhat familiar...)<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Hmmm. Hey, Yomi-onee-san?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> What is it, Tsubakuro-san?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Does Clau-onee-san remind you of anybody? She feels really familiar for some reason...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Oh my, you had the same impression, Yume?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ...That would be Konohana-san, wouldn&#x27;t it? Though she hasn&#x27;t acted like that for a long time.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh, Suzuka-onee-san, did you used to be like that?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes. Just like that.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> (...Ahh, so that&#x27;s what it was.)<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Saijou-san?<br>
<strong>Claudine:</strong> What? It&#x27;s true that you need to practice. I haven&#x27;t said anything wrong either.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...I&#x27;m not here about that. It&#x27;s difficult, isn&#x27;t it? Following after another.<br>
<strong>Claudine:</strong> What are you talking about?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> There&#x27;s someone who&#x27;s captured your attention, isn&#x27;t there?<br>
<strong>Claudine:</strong> ...Not really.<br>
<strong>Claudine:</strong> There&#x27;s only someone I&#x27;m going to surpass. Without fail.<br>
<strong>Claudine:</strong> Oh, right, about getting opinions on your performance. Since you have the chance, why not ask all of us?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Of course, we will--<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Shichinosato-san, here comes another wave. We may need to break out the flag for this one. [Referring to a flag Japanese fishermen will hoist after catching a huge haul]<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Was that supposed to be a joke!?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> And besides, they&#x27;re all mine! Nobody&#x27;s taking them from me!!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Suzuka! Yomi! Yume! We&#x27;re moving in too!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Understood.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> It&#x27;s boring fighting these weakling aradama though.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Now that&#x27;s how Maki-san ought to be.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> You&#x27;ve started acting like an elite guard again.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="4-the-star-we-sought"></a>4: The Star We Sought<a class="hash-link" href="#4-the-star-we-sought" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Mirja:</strong> After all that, it seems the amount of aradama appearing has decreased.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I think so too, Mirja-san!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> If we keep up the pace, we&#x27;ll be back home in no time... Wait, we can&#x27;t!!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> What&#x27;s wrong with going home?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> You want to stay in this aradama infested theater production from hell forever?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> But still! The lovely ladies from Seisho! I still need to cozy up with them!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...Do you listen to yourself talk?<br>
<strong>Kaoruko:</strong> Lovely ladies, you say. Well, that&#x27;s only a natural reaction.<br>
<strong>Futaba:</strong> Don&#x27;t flatter yourself.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I get what you mean, Yui-chan.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Kanami-chan! I didn&#x27;t think I had an ally here!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Everyone from Seisho, their movements are so beautiful. Right down to their fingertips; it&#x27;s so precise!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> ...That&#x27;s not the kind of ally I was looking for!<br>
<strong>Karen:</strong> Stage girls are evolving every day!<br>
<strong>Karen:</strong> Even when fighting aradama, you can&#x27;t forget about the stage!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> That&#x27;s an interesting perspective, Etou Kanami. Unlike Yamashiro Yui&#x27;s.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Everyone from Seisho acts with such finesse, though their fundamental movements are all different.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Is there something like schools of swordsmanship within theater performance?<br>
<strong>Hikari:</strong> ...The difference in our fields of expertise?<br>
<strong>Juuna:</strong> It might be something like that. Isurugi-san, swordfights are your specialty, aren&#x27;t they?<br>
<strong>Futaba:</strong> Yeah, I don&#x27;t plan on letting anyone show me up when it comes to a swordfighting scene.<br>
<strong>Mahiru:</strong> For me, it would be the baton?<br>
<strong>Nana:</strong> The toji girls are the other way around, right?<br>
<strong>Nana:</strong> There&#x27;s differences in the details, but the way they move their whole bodies are all tuned for using a sword.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> The way we move our bodies is tuned for using a sword... You mean our fundamentals are the same?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> ...I wonder if that could help us improve our dance performance?<br>
<strong>Karen:</strong> Dance performance?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I&#x27;ll explain that.<br>
<strong>Karen:</strong> The toji are dressing up as mikos for a dance!?<br>
<strong>Junna:</strong> You&#x27;re all so athletic, so it should be a real show seeing you all moving together.<br>
<strong>Nana:</strong> Yeah, yeah. I wish I could be there to see it.<br>
<strong>Karen:</strong> Put on the show for us here!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> If we want your opinions, the best way would be to practice in front of you.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh!? We&#x27;re doing it now!?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Tendou Maya. It might still be far from complete, but will you watch our performance?<br>
<strong>Maya:</strong> That&#x27;s an important responsibility. Because it&#x27;s incomplete, that&#x27;s all the more reason for you to need our opinions.<br>
<strong>Hikari:</strong> What do you mean?<br>
<strong>Claudine:</strong> They can&#x27;t seem to get their closing act to come together.<br>
<strong>Karen:</strong> Why do you know that, Clau-chan!?<br>
<strong>Claudine:</strong> I heard it from them earlier. They said they wanted advice on how to improve.<br>
<strong>Hikari:</strong> ...Why didn&#x27;t you tell us?<br>
<strong>Claudine:</strong> We were going to, but then the aradama arrived. Anyway, let&#x27;s move things along. Start your performance.<br>
<strong>Karen:</strong> That was so intense!<br>
<strong>Junna:</strong> Agreed. Getting to see it up close, you get such a sense that those okatana are the real thing.<br>
<strong>Futaba:</strong> When it comes to the dancing, that&#x27;s Kaoruko&#x27;s field, right? You want to help them out?<br>
<strong>Kaoruko:</strong> You say that, but wasn&#x27;t that closer to a combat demonstration than a dance?<br>
<strong>Kaoruko:</strong> I don&#x27;t have a single bit of advice to offer.<br>
<strong>Nana:</strong> A combat demonstration... Ah, maybe that&#x27;s why the just the last part felt different?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> That&#x27;s it! Please, tell me more! What is our performance missing?<br>
<strong>Karen:</strong> It&#x27;s hard to say exactly what... When you&#x27;re swinging your okatana, it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s filled with emotion?<br>
<strong>Karen:</strong> It&#x27;s like a real dance performance then.<br>
<strong>Hikari:</strong> It must be because you have a clear image of a target in mind.<br>
<strong>Nana:</strong> Aradama, right.<br>
<strong>Mahiru:</strong> So then, why isn&#x27;t the last part going as well?<br>
<strong>Claudine:</strong> ...It&#x27;s because they can&#x27;t get their mental images aligned, isn&#x27;t it?<br>
<strong>Claudine:</strong> Just looking at Maki and Suzuka, there&#x27;s force behind Maki&#x27;s movement, but Suzuka&#x27;s was more delicate, wasn&#x27;t it?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong>  Delicate? I wasn&#x27;t intending to restrain myself...<br>
<strong>Claudine:</strong> I&#x27;m only talking about the difference I felt between what you two were picturing. Maki imagined cutting down an aradama, and...<br>
<strong>Maya:</strong> Konohana-san had returning her sword to its sheath in mind.<br>
<strong>Claudine:</strong> Well, that&#x27;s about it.<br>
<strong>Maki/Suzuka:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Junna:</strong> So, to sum it up, at the very end of this dance performance, you can&#x27;t unify what you&#x27;re all expressing?<br>
<strong>Karen:</strong> Yeah! That&#x27;s it!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Our mental image, huh. I think mine is staying on guard.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I think that&#x27;s mine too.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> I picture striking down my enemy.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I imagine ending everything with a big group hug!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Can&#x27;t we just imagine taking a break, since it&#x27;s done?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> You two... Are you not going to take this seriously?<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> GGGGAAAAAOOOOOO!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Tch, aradama!?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Oh my, and a rather large one at that.<br>
<strong>Claudine:</strong> C&#x27;est pire! ...Could it not have given us a little more time here!?<br>
<strong>Karen:</strong> Why are you two acting so calm when there&#x27;s that giant monster aradama!?<br>
<strong>Maya:</strong> Its size has nothing to do with this. They can at last see their performance taking shape.<br>
<strong>Maya:</strong> Once this aradama is defeated, their dance can be completed.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Right, so let&#x27;s go!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="5-a-time-we-surely-shared"></a>5: A Time We Surely Shared<a class="hash-link" href="#5-a-time-we-surely-shared" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Giraffe:</strong> You&#x27;ve done well, toji. The audition will resume.<br>
<strong>Karen:</strong> If the audition&#x27;s resuming... That means we took out all the aradama?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Now we can go back home, Hiyori-chan!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...Can we really go back though? I don&#x27;t even remember how we got here in the first place...<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Come to think of it, just how much time has passed since we came here?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> It might be like Urashima Tarou when we get back. [a fairytale about a man who spends time in an underwater kingdom and finds a century has passed when he returns]<br>
<strong>Karen:</strong> Hey, Kanami-chan and them can get back fine, can&#x27;t they?<br>
<strong>Giraffe:</strong> Of course, I will dutifully return them home.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> That&#x27;s good to hear.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ...Before we go, could we show you our performance one last time? I want you to see the final act with all of our minds focused on the same mental image.<br>
<strong>Maya:</strong> We would be glad to.<br>
<strong>Karen:</strong> Cause we&#x27;ll get to see an even better performance than before!<br>
<strong>Hikari:</strong> ...I can&#x27;t wait.<br>
<strong>Nana:</strong> And this time, I&#x27;ll be sure to take some good photos of it.<br>
<strong>Juuna:</strong> Is there any way we could exchange the pictures?<br>
<strong>Mahiru:</strong> I wonder if we would have time to print it out?<br>
<strong>Claudine:</strong> Why don&#x27;t we just test sending it to them now?<br>
<strong>Futaba:</strong> Test it... Do our phones work the same as theirs?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> They look to be the same. Daiba-san, would you mind sending me the data?<br>
<strong>Nana:</strong> Sure thing. Here, point your phone this way.<br>
<strong>Kaoruko:</strong> Anyway, how much time do we have left?<br>
<strong>Giraffe:</strong> They leave right now.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Right now... Wait, huh? This is, the boarding house...?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> It was a dream?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Was that dream about fighting aradama in an underground theater, by any chance?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I had the same dream too!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Was it a dream?<br>
<strong>Nene:</strong> Ne-?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Don&#x27;t tell me... Those theater cuties were all a figment of my imagination!?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> No, I don&#x27;t believe it was a dream.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ah! Suzuka-onee-san! Is that picture the one Banana-onee-san sent you?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> That&#x27;s right. I still have it, right here. Look.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> The advice they gave us... It won&#x27;t go to waste.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> First, we&#x27;re all going to synchronize our mental image of our performance! After that, we&#x27;re going to practice!  </p><p>On the day the dance performance would be shown to the public.</p><p><strong>Maki:</strong> (Everything&#x27;s gone well so far... All that&#x27;s left is the closing act... It&#x27;ll be fine.)<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> (We&#x27;ve shared our mental image, like the stage girls suggested.)<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> (All we need is to...!)<br>
<strong>Cheers:</strong> HURRAAAAHHHH!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="6-collecting-suzudaru-cats"></a>6: Collecting Suzudaru Cats!<a class="hash-link" href="#6-collecting-suzudaru-cats" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Karen:</strong> There really are some things besides aradama that&#x27;re different between our world and yours, Kanami-chan.<br>
<strong>Karen:</strong> You still have the Tokyo Tower, right? And it&#x27;s still red like it&#x27;s supposed to be, right?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Yep, it&#x27;s still red alright!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> I wonder why things are different. Aradama and okatana don&#x27;t exist...<br>
<strong>Hikari:</strong> Starlight, which has been performed countless times around the world, doesn&#x27;t exist...<br>
<strong>Mahiru:</strong> Ah, that reminds me. I wanted to ask you something. Does Suzudaru Cat exist in your world too?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Suzudaru Cat? Hmm, I haven&#x27;t heard of it. How about you, Kanami-chan?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I&#x27;ve never heard of it either.<br>
<strong>Mahiru:</strong> I don&#x27;t believe it~... A world without Suzudaru Cat...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> What kind of cat is it?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Hey, hey. What&#x27;re you talking about?<br>
<strong>Karen:</strong> Yume-chan, Yomi-chan. We were just talking about how, isn&#x27;t it weird how some things are different between our worlds?<br>
<strong>Mahiru:</strong> Ah! It&#x27;s Suzudaru Cat! So you have it in your world after all; thank goodness~.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> What do you mean, Suzudaru Cat?<br>
<strong>Mahiru:</strong> Eh!? You&#x27;re holding it right there~.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Huhh. So this thing&#x27;s called Suzudaru Cat?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> It dropped off of an aradama just now.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> An aradama?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> That&#x27;s Suzudaru Cat...?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Woww... It&#x27;s too cute, Mahiru-chan! There&#x27;s this sort of unexplainable charm to it!<br>
<strong>Mahiru:</strong> Isn&#x27;t there? Suzudaru Cat has that kind of cuteness you just can&#x27;t describe-!<br>
<strong>Mahiru:</strong> Ahhh, I&#x27;m glad I found someone who can understand Suzudaru Cat&#x27;s greatness~.<br>
<strong>Karen:</strong> I&#x27;m happy for you, Mahiru-chan.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> You like those kind of mascot characters, don&#x27;t you, Kanami-chan?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah, I love them!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Hey, Tsubakuro-san, Satsuki-san? What was it like when you got that Suzudaru Cat?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Just before the aradama I killed dissappeared, it was like, poof!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I can&#x27;t say it will be the same for all aradama, but that&#x27;s what it was like with the one we defeated.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Cool, so while we suppress the aradama, we can also collect a bunch of Suzudaru Cats!<br>
<strong>Mahiru:</strong> Defeating aradama means getting Suzudaru Cats...!<br>
<strong>Mahiru:</strong> Etou-san! If it&#x27;s alright with you, do you think you could... share some of the Suzudaru Cats you find?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Of course! I&#x27;m not about to take them all for myself! Let&#x27;s share them with everyone! Hiyori-chan, you&#x27;re fine with that too, right?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> I-I never said I wanted any, did I?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> But they&#x27;re so cute. I know I&#x27;ll come to like them soon enough.<br>
<strong>Hikari:</strong> Mr. White is even more amazing though... [mumbled]<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Did you say something, Hikari?<br>
<strong>Hikari:</strong> ...I didn&#x27;t say anything.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Come on, let&#x27;s go ask everyone to start collecting Suzudaru Cats from the aradama!</p></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="theme-doc-footer-edit-meta-row row"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations/edit/docs/Revue_Stage_Girls_and_Toji_no_Miko.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="theme-edit-this-page"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_2_ui" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_13-_"></div></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"></div></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_35-E thin-scrollbar"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#1-the-training-camp-runs-into-trouble" class="table-of-contents__link">1: The Training Camp Runs into Trouble</a></li><li><a href="#2-could-this-be-another-world" class="table-of-contents__link">2: ...Could This Be Another World?</a></li><li><a href="#3-a-shared-resemblance" class="table-of-contents__link">3: A Shared Resemblance</a></li><li><a href="#4-the-star-we-sought" class="table-of-contents__link">4: The Star We Sought</a></li><li><a href="#5-a-time-we-surely-shared" class="table-of-contents__link">5: A Time We Surely Shared</a></li><li><a href="#6-collecting-suzudaru-cats" class="table-of-contents__link">6: Collecting Suzudaru Cats!</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Links</div><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://pastebin.com/LdyviZ8Z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Translator anon&#x27;s pastebin<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Site source code<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Built with Docusaurus.</div></div></div></footer></div>
