This might be tough.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I&#x27;m thinking about trying to improve my concentration, but, am I really doing it, you know?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Though... If we don&#x27;t do it, we won&#x27;t wake up from this dream, will we...?<br>
<strong>Erika:</strong> Aren&#x27;t you overthinking this a little, Mihono, Kiyoka? If you&#x27;re getting into your ideal state, you should be able to do it even when you&#x27;re relaxed.<br>
<strong>Erika:</strong> Take Kanami for example. She&#x27;s having fun challenging everybody to matches, see?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> That&#x27;s cause it&#x27;s so much fun!<br>
<strong>Erika:</strong> And, saying that, I&#x27;ve gone along with her countless times.<br>
<strong>Angelina:</strong> I stopped by to watch partway through, and they kept going for over an hour.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Kanami&#x27;s really something.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Erika-san&#x27;s swordsmanship has this unfamiliar feeling to it, so I just can&#x27;t help but want to see more!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Hmm. Erika-onee-san, are you strong?<br>
<strong>Erika:</strong> What&#x27;s that-? You want to go too, Yume?<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> Chiba-san, you&#x27;re such a popular girl.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Nnn, that wouldn&#x27;t be bad either, but...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Since this is supposed to be a dream, I wanna try doing something even more exciting!<br>
<strong>Erika:</strong> Whoops, I got rejected. So, what kind of exciting things did you have in mind?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I want to use magic!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I know there&#x27;s magic in the world you onee-sans come from, so maybe I can do it too here, since it&#x27;s a dream!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> You&#x27;re not giving up on that, huh, Yume.<br>
<strong>Honoka:</strong> If you could use magic, what sort of things would you like to do, Yume-chan?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Let me see... Maybe fly in the sky? That&#x27;d be fun for sure, and it&#x27;d probably feel good to fly wherever you want!<br>
<strong>Miyuki:</strong> Flight magic, then. In our world, provided you have enough magic power, we&#x27;ve shown that&#x27;s a technique many magicians are capable of using.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> You&#x27;ve flown in the sky before!?<br>
<strong>Miyuki:</strong> I have. My first experience with it was highly enjoyable, and I felt proud to be a part of it.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> That&#x27;s so cool-! I want to fly too!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> That&#x27;s awesome! So you really can fly around in the sky-.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Since it&#x27;s a dream, if you jumped down from one of the school windows or somewhere up high, maybe you&#x27;d start flying-?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> So long as you decide that your ideal self should be able to fly around!<br>
<strong>Mihono/Kanami:</strong> Ah-!?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I was wondering what all the excitement was about... Yume... You can&#x27;t know that for sure, so give it up.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> And, Asakura and Etou. Could you not look at her like she just came up with something genius?<br>
<strong>Mihono/Kanami:</strong> Ahaha...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh. It&#x27;s okay if I&#x27;m just going to give it a try, right-?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yume. We may be within a dream, but you still feel pain here, don&#x27;t you?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I&#x27;m sure that Ban-san has prepared some sort of safety mechanism, but, if worse comes to worst, we can&#x27;t be certain it won&#x27;t have an effect on your body or mind.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ehhh.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Flying in the air does sound incredible, but I think this dream has a lot of limitations to it.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Even if we wish for it, the aradama won&#x27;t just up and vanish in an instant. ...[chomp]<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> What&#x27;s that you&#x27;ve got there, Onee-san?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Chocolate mint ice cream... [chomp]<br>
<strong>Shizuku:</strong> ...[chomp]. Though, I know the feeling of wanting to try something since it&#x27;s a dream. The magic we use can&#x27;t do everything, after all.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> ...I don&#x27;t really want to hear anything from you onee-sans while you&#x27;re all satisfied eating your dream ice cream though-.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...Ngh.<br>
<strong>Miyuki:</strong> Fufu, it seems she&#x27;s struck a sore spot, Hiyori-san.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Yeah, yeah. I only wanted to try it a little bit too.<br>
<strong>Miyuki:</strong> You&#x27;re just brimming with curiosity, aren&#x27;t you, Yume-san.<br>
<strong>Miyuki:</strong> However, even if this dream may seem both real and fantastical, doesn&#x27;t it seem difficult for anything out of a fairytale to appear, like a house made of candy?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yes. It&#x27;s likely just as Shiba-san says; it&#x27;s unlikely anything can happen that strays too far from our common sense of the world.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> That&#x27;s how it is, Yume. You&#x27;ll just have to live with it.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Grr--! Fine then! I&#x27;m not going to ask you onee-sans what to do anymore!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah... Yume-chan!?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Wait... Yume!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="2-chasing-yume-like-in-the-events-title-yume-isnt-written-in-kanji-here-so-it-could-mean-both-yume-and-dreams"></a>2: Chasing Yume [Like in the event&#x27;s title, Yume isn&#x27;t written in kanji here, so it could mean both Yume and dreams]<a class="hash-link" href="#2-chasing-yume-like-in-the-events-title-yume-isnt-written-in-kanji-here-so-it-could-mean-both-yume-and-dreams" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Mayumi:</strong> This here. It looks like Tsubakuro-san dropped it earlier. I think it&#x27;s some sort of character keyring.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> That&#x27;s the mascot character, Ichigo Daifuku Neko.<br>
<strong>Honoka:</strong> Ah, now that you mention it, it looks like it has a strawberry daifuku motif. It&#x27;s cute...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Yume really likes that character.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Still... Yume completely blew her top back there.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...We&#x27;ll have to think up something else besides simply searching for her.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Even if we can&#x27;t go as far as making her fly... So long as we had something else that&#x27;ll make her happy.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> That&#x27;s just it...<br>
<strong>Suzuka/Maki:</strong> ...!<br>
<strong>Miyuki:</strong> ?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Sorry to ask you this so suddenly, but... Is there any way you could make Yume happy with your magic? Of course, if it&#x27;s too difficult, I won&#x27;t blame you for refusing.<br>
<strong>Angelina:</strong> You and Suzuka both seem strict on her, but actually... You&#x27;re very sweet with that girl, aren&#x27;t you?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> We have to give her a proper warning, but she is something like a little sister to us.<br>
<strong>Miyuki:</strong> I don&#x27;t have anything specific in mind now, but, could we think on it a little?<br>
<strong>Honoka:</strong> You&#x27;re doing so much for us, so I want to help too.<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> Let&#x27;s pitch in for Tsubakuro-san&#x27;s sake. If we&#x27;re going to make her happy, we might as well give her a surprise that she can&#x27;t help but smile with.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Thank you, all of you. If you think of anything at all that you need, please ask us without hesitation.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Then, Yomi and I will go looking for Yume.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ...There&#x27;s a possibility that Tsubakuro-san didn&#x27;t give up on trying to fly, after all.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I&#x27;ll help look for Yume-chan too!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Shidou-san, Satsuki-san. I&#x27;ll go too!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> That would be a great help. Thank you very much.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Then, let&#x27;s move quick. I&#x27;d appreciate if you girls did what you could too.<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> Of course; you can count on us.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ...If she&#x27;s already left the school, we&#x27;ll have to go outside.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> I thought she might be on the roof or one of the upper floors, but couldn&#x27;t find anything...<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes. I thought the same thing.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Still, I didn&#x27;t expect this. For you to help with the search.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> I was looking where she might jump down. I&#x27;m just thinking, when I was talking to her, I should have chosen my words a bit more carefully.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Let&#x27;s search elsewhere.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Right. We should meet up with Shidou-san and the others for now.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ...You didn&#x27;t find anything either, Yomi?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Unfortunately.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I see. Then, we&#x27;ll just have to take things slow and steady.<br>
<strong>Erika:</strong> We&#x27;re going to help you too.<br>
<strong>Erika:</strong> Lina and I looked around this area earlier, but we didn&#x27;t find her. She wasn&#x27;t in her room or anything, was she?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Thank you very much, both of you. Yes, I just checked there.<br>
<strong>Angelina:</strong> If we&#x27;re going to find Yume, I&#x27;d like to have some kind of lead first. Do you have anything like that?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Since she said she wanted to try flying before she ran out, it&#x27;s possible she might try jumping from somewhere high...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> But, it is Yume we&#x27;re talking about. She might&#x27;ve also completely dropped that and is doing something else now.<br>
<strong>Angelina:</strong> I suppose... All we can do now is ask around.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="3-i-hope-todays-memories-remain"></a>3: I Hope Today&#x27;s Memories Remain<a class="hash-link" href="#3-i-hope-todays-memories-remain" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Maki:</strong> Was Yume there!?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah, Shidou-san!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> From what witnesses said, it looks like Yume-chan was at a souvenir shop around here.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> But, with this many people around... We can&#x27;t find her!<br>
<strong>Angelina:</strong> It would be a real challenge looking for one person in this crowd. Can you still not reach her?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> She hasn&#x27;t replied to phone calls or text messages.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Still, why is she at a tourist place right near Renpu?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> If Yume&#x27;s given up on trying to fly, that&#x27;s a relief, but we don&#x27;t know what she&#x27;s up to now.<br>
<strong>Erika:</strong> It&#x27;d be weird to go sightseeing somewhere right next to where you usually stay too.<br>
<strong>Angelina:</strong> Maybe she&#x27;s curious about finding differences between the dream world and the real world...?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Who can say? Though, in Tsubakuro-san&#x27;s case, I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s very likely.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> What if she just came here to have fun?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Over there; I see Yume-chan!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> What did you onee-sans come here in a big group for?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ah. Were you maybe gonna start doing something fun? If you were, then you should&#x27;ve told me first-.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> That&#x27;s not it...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Then, what? Tell me!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> We only came out here to find you after you went running off. We weren&#x27;t planning on doing anything else.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh... All these people came just to look for me? Why...? Are you sure you weren&#x27;t doing something else?<br>
<strong>Erika:</strong> We were worried after you vanished all of a sudden. Especially Maki here. And, what did you come here for, Yume?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Heh hehh~. That&#x27;s because-, this place is selling a limited edition Buddha version Ichigo Daifuku Neko purse!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I was suprised they were selling it in the dream! They haven&#x27;t actually sold these for real yet.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> The truth is stranger than fiction... Would that mean that Tsubakuro-san&#x27;s power of imagination overcame the dream?<br>
<strong>Angelina:</strong> You really do love that mascot character, don&#x27;t you, Yume. Is it a daifuku, or a Buddha... I can&#x27;t even tell.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Nn? Suzuka&#x27;s calling me.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Yeah, we found her just now. Understood. We&#x27;ll take Yume with us and head there.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Where are we going?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I think you&#x27;ll definitely find this interesting. Let&#x27;s go.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Onee-sans, why&#x27;d you all come out here for? It doesn&#x27;t look we&#x27;re here to swim, and it&#x27;s a little early, isn&#x27;t it?<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> The truth is... Starting now, we&#x27;re going to put on a quick show of how great magic is for you, Tsubakuro-san!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> You mean it-!?<br>
<strong>Miyuki:</strong> Yes. Now then, Saegusa-senpai. Let&#x27;s get started.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Yume: That&#x27;s a really big round ball of... ice?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> That&#x27;s crazy! I bet you could make shaved ice for hundreds of people with all that!<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> Now it&#x27;s time for me to show my strengths. --Here goes!<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> I&#x27;ll need your help too, Miyuki-san. I&#x27;m depending on you.<br>
<strong>Miyuki:</strong> Please count on me. --YAA!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Now they&#x27;re chipping away at the big ice with little ice!? Hey, what&#x27;re you making?<br>
<strong>Angelina:</strong> You&#x27;ll just have to wait and see, Yume.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Whoaa-!<br>
<strong>Shizuku:</strong> Now for the finishing touch. Honoka, you&#x27;re up.<br>
<strong>Honoka:</strong> ...O-Okay! Just have to light up the finished ice sculpture... There.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> You made a giant Ichigo Daifuku Neko out of ice!! Wow wow wow! It&#x27;s all sparkling!<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> It took a little bit of time, but don&#x27;t you think it turned out rather well?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Yeah! I&#x27;ve never seen one this big before!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...Even though it was on short term notice, the results are impressive.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Because of this big Ichigo Daifuku Neko, it sort of feels nice and cool... I know; can I take pictures?<br>
<strong>Miyuki:</strong> Of course.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> We hurried over after Asakura Mihono called us, but this truly is an incredible sight.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Right. I didn&#x27;t think it would be so elaborately made.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I&#x27;m going to take some pictures of the ice sculpture with Mayumi-san and everyone, to commemorate!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You&#x27;re just using the ice sculpture as an excuse to take their pictures, aren&#x27;t you...?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> ~ ~.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> ~ ~.<br>
<strong>Erika:</strong> They seem really happy with it.<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> It was worth going to the effort.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Thank you as well, Mitsui-san.<br>
<strong>Honoka:</strong> This much was nothing at all. It&#x27;s easy for me to keep it going long enough for Yume-chan to enjoy herself taking photos.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ah... But, when we wake up from the dream, these pictures won&#x27;t be there anymore, will they. I wish they&#x27;d be there forever-.<br>
<strong>Miyuki:</strong> Even so, if we believe they will remain, that might just end up being the case.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Miyuki-san&#x27;s right. Since we&#x27;re all here, we should take a group photo of everyone in front of the ice sculpture.<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> That&#x27;s a great idea, Etou-san! How about that, Tsubakuro-san?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I&#x27;m totally okay with it-. But, who&#x27;s going to take the picture?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I&#x27;ll take care of it!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Go on; everybody bunch up in front of the ice sculpture-. Honoka-san, if I could get you to move a little too please-. I want to capture you in all your glory-!<br>
<strong>Honoka:</strong> Okay, I got it.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> If you could get up against the other girls... Just squeeeze yourself right up against them!<br>
<strong>Honoka:</strong> Ehhhhhh!? S-Squeeze against them!?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Feel free to disregard her comment just now.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Isn&#x27;t this great, Yume.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Yeah! Thanks, all you onee-sans!</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations/edit/docs/Yume_and_the_Ice_Magic_Sequence.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_2_ui" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_3DPF"></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"></div></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_35-E thin-scrollbar"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#1-i-still-want-to-do-it-like-magic" class="table-of-contents__link">1: I Still Want to Do It, Like Magic!</a></li><li><a href="#2-chasing-yume-like-in-the-events-title-yume-isnt-written-in-kanji-here-so-it-could-mean-both-yume-and-dreams" class="table-of-contents__link">2: Chasing Yume Like in the event's title, Yume isn't written in kanji here, so it could mean both Yume and dreams</a></li><li><a href="#3-i-hope-todays-memories-remain" class="table-of-contents__link">3: I Hope Today&#39;s Memories Remain</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Links</div><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://pastebin.com/LdyviZ8Z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Translator anon&#x27;s pastebin<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Site source code<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Built with Docusaurus.</div></div></div></footer></div>
