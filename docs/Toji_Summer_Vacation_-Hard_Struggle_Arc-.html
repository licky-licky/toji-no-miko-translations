you can see the sea from here-! I can't wait; I haven't been to the beach in forever!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I know! Thank goodness they gave us a summer break! I even bought a brand new swimsuit!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I always took you for an indoor type, Musumi Kiyoka. But you seem more excited than usual?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ahaha... I was looking forward to this. Getting to do summer vacation things like a normal girl.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Mann~, if only the rest of the investigation team could have made it.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> There's nothing we could do. Setouchi Chie said she was going to Okayama to visit her parents, and Shichinosato Kofuki had no interest in going on a trip.<br><strong>Tanaka Taeko:</strong> We'll be getting off in a minute, everyone. Make sure you don't forget anything.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> --I won't~! Tanaka-sensei, thanks a lot for taking us here today!<br><strong>Taeko:</strong> It's no trouble, really. Just part of my responsibilities as a grown up.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Whoa, you can really smell the saltwater!<br><strong>Taeko:</strong> Mm, the weather's nice. Good thing the skies are clear.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Let's get changed and get in the water, everyone! We only get to experience this summer once, you know!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ahaha! Kiyoka's really getting into it today! Okay, let me just get my swimsuit on--<br><strong>Beachgoer A:</strong> Hey, I think that's an aradama coming from town!<br><strong>Beachgoer B:</strong> Wait, seriously!? You think it'll come this way...?<br><strong>Beachgoer C:</strong> Let's get out of here! We gotta find a place to hide!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Aradama in the town...?<br><strong>Taeko:</strong> I'll confirm this with the Special Ritual Squad! I hate to ask you, but could you three make sure everything's okay in town?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ughh~ Why'd this have to happen nowww~... Alright! We'll be right there!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Eh, ah...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Musumi Kiyoka, we have to hurry!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> O-Okay...!<br><strong>Passerby 1:</strong> Ahhhhh! Help me---!<br><strong>Passerby 2:</strong> Eek! Anybodyyy!<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> GUUOOOOO...!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> There they are! Aradama!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Uuu... They really areee~... And there's a lot of them too...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> We won't have time to wait for support... We'll have to suppress them here!<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> GUAAAAAAAA...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Phew... That's the last of them, I think?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I'm confirming that all aradama in the area of the town have been eliminated. It should be safe to remove utsushi, for the time being.<br><strong>Riot Officer:</strong> I'm very sorry! You had to take care of this place by yourselves...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> No... Defeating aradama is our duty, after all.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Pant, pant... Why didn't any other toji arrive...?<br><strong>Riot Officer:</strong> Several mass outbreaks of aradama were found in the surrounding mountains... All other Special Ritual Squad personnel in the area were sent in to respond.<br><strong>Riot Officer:</strong> The aradama that were sighted here most likely came down from the mountains seeking inhabited areas.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> You sound understaffed... Have you heard anything from Headquarters? Will they be sending reinforcements?<br><strong>Riot Officer:</strong> About that... They're also lacking toji able to respond here in any hurry, so forming a unit of reinforcements could take some time...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Mirja-san, we should go into the mountains to help stop the aradama! We can't risk the chance of them attacking people on the beach!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> You're right. Then, we will be mobilizing as of now. Our objective is locating the sites of the aradama outbreak, and eliminating them.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> O-Okay~...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> (Awww... My summer vacation~...)<br><strong>???:</strong> Fu Fu Fu...! I didn't expect to encounter them here... This is my chance to gather data on the investigation team members!  </p><h2 id="2-a-call-for-relief-and-a-hole-in-the-beach" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>2: A Call for Relief and a Hole in the Beach</h2><p><strong>Ellen:</strong> Oh! What a beautiful beach!<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Nene, nene-!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> My family's private beach is a little further up ahead.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> A private beach... People actually own those in real life... I thought they were just a thing in movies and manga.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> I'd heard you came from a rich family, but... No wonder Kanami suggested going to the beach.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Though, Kanami herself isn't even here.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Well, Kanami-chan did come down with an awful summer cold just before we left...<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...I'm kind of worried about Kanami.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Don't feel bad for her, Sayaka. It's her own fault that she doesn't take care of herself. She even sleeps with her stomach exposed; she's that bad...!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Ahaha... Hey, Sayaka-chan. Remember what Kanami-chan said? To have a bunch of stories to tell her when we get back.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> If she hears that we weren't having fun because we were worried about her, I'm sure Kanami-chan will feel guilty about it.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...Okay, I understand. I'll have fun for Kanami then.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Alright, hurry up and get your swimsuits on then--<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> A phone call at a time like this...? Oh... It's from Sana-sensei too.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Geh, I don't wanna hear this...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Hii, how's it going, this is Ellen!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Okay, okay... Yes, I understand... Then, goodbye.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Did something come up, Ellen-chan?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Sounds like there was a mass outbreak of aradama in the mountains near here.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Which means-- Sorry Kaoru, but it's work time.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Tch, what the hell is the Special Ritual Squad doing?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> This branch and Headquarters are both very shorthanded. If they weren't, Sana-sensei wouldn't have called us while we're on vacation.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Sigh... This sucks. In the first place, are they even gonna make up for how much time this takes?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...Mai, we should help too.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Right. I don't want to have come this far only to not spend our vacation together. If we all chip in, it'll go faster--<br><strong>Voice:</strong> Eeeeeek-!<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> GUOOOOOO...!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Oh no! There's an aradama coming after her!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Leave it to me. I'll handle this. --Haah!<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> GUAAAAAAA...<br><strong>???:</strong> Sigh~, my hero~!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Ah, I know her. She's a 3rd year highschooler, Watanabe Emily. Even in Osafune she's famous for being a weirdo.<br><strong>Emily:</strong> I'm not about to pretend like I didn't hear that! I am not a weirdo; just a bit more stalker-ish than your average person, and brimming with curiosity!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Yeah, that's what makes you a weirdo...<br><strong>Emily:</strong> Tohoho... I was merely sneaking after the investigation team, thinking I could acquire some data on them... How did I end up in such a dangerous situation...?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...Somehow, I feel like she's not worth the effort.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Let's just leave her here.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Of course. Once we're in the mountains, who knows where aradama might attack from!<br><strong>Emily:</strong> I refuse! No matter what it takes, I'll get that data on the investigation team--<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Heave, ho, heave, ho.<br><strong>Emily:</strong> What's this...? Kohagura-san, why have you started digging a hole in the beach...?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Kukuku, I wonder why-?<br><strong>Emily:</strong> Ah-, you don't mean to...!? ...A-Awawawwawa...!  </p><h2 id="3-summer-vacation-belongs-to-everyone" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>3: Summer Vacation Belongs to Everyone</h2><p><strong>Aradama:</strong> GUUOOOOOO-!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Uwawah!?  
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Hah-!<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> GUUUUUUU...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Are you unhurt, Asakura Mihono!?  
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Y-Yeah... Thanks, Mirja-san...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> (This isn't good... The aradama from this outbreak are unusually strong and numerous.)<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> (Asakura Mihono must be nearing the limit of her concentration. And then, Musumi Kiyoka...)<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Pant... Pant...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> (Why did this have to happen...)<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> (It's finally summer break... This isn't what I came to the beach for...)<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Musumi Kiyoka, get hold of yourself! Another group of aradama is approaching!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Huh...?<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> GUOOOOOO!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It's got me...!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> (I can't... It's no use...!)  
<strong>Aradama:</strong> Gwaaaaa...!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> What do you think you're doing!? Don't look away from your enemy!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Eh...? Is that you, Juujou-san...!?  
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Yes. And not just me.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Hup-! Haaah-!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> --Haa-!<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> Gyaaa... aaa...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Are you girls from the investigation team okay-!? Sana-sensei sent us to be your backup-!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Osafune's President Maniwa... I'm very grateful for your cooperation.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Ah-, save that for when we're done. Damnit, just when I had the free time to mess around at the beach...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Wait... You too?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Yes, we're on summer vacation. But we can't just ignore something like this happening.<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Ne-, nene-!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I promised to eat shaved ice on the beach with Mai. So I don't want aradama stopping us.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Right! And it's not just us; all the regular beachgoers wouldn't be able to enjoy themselves either!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Juujou-san, Itomi-san, and Yanase-san...!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> (That's right, everyone else is going through this too... I'm not the only one who came here to have a good time... Somehow, I hadn't realized that...)<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> (But I can't keep just complaining about it!)  
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Hah-- Yaaaaa-!<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> GWAAAaaaaaa...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Fu, you've finally gotten serious.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Then let's finish 'em off. If we don't hurry, the tide'll come in.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> The tide? What about it?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Don't mind us, it's a private matter.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Mihono, have you caught your breath? We need to quickly eliminate them here and keep moving.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Y-Yeah!<br><strong>Emily:</strong> Is anybody there-! Can somebody help me-! They buried me in the sand and left; isn't that terrible---!<br><strong>Emily:</strong> Ah... Is it my imagination... Or are the waves creeping ever closer...? Does that mean this spot will be underwater in just a few hours...?

Good work, everyone.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Eh? Was that the last one?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> You got so carried away while you were fighting, huh Kiyoka!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Yeah, you went all out. Way to go, you.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That's all of them...? Then, our summer vacation...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Ah, that's right! Hey, Musumi-san? It might have been fate running into you here, so would you like to come back to the beach with us?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Good idea! I'm all for it, Maimai!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> The Yanase family apparently owns a private beach near here. There won't be anyone around, so we can do whatever we want.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> And they have shaved ice.<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Nene, nenene-!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> A private beach, with shaved ice...! Oh, but...?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Don't worry, Musumi Kiyoka. The Special Ritual Squad will take care of the cleanup work to be done here.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah, we don't often get an invitation like this! Let's go, Kiyoka!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Okay!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...Oh. Oi, Ellen, what time is it?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> What time? Well, it's still a while before sunset...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Ahhh-! I totally forgot-!<br><strong>Emily:</strong> How could you be so cruellll-! Humans can't breathe underwater, you knowwwwww-!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Uh, my bad, my bad. But it's not such a big deal, right? You only got a little wet.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Sorry, we'll bury you a little further away next time.<br><strong>Emily:</strong> Nooooo-! Don't bury me at alllll-!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> We made it back to the beach so fast thanks to you, Kiyoka. You were really awesome back there.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You're exaggerating... But...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I've never had a chance to go on a trip with anyone during summer vacation before...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> But since I became a member of the investigation team, I got to know everyone, so I was really looking forward to this...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Still, I'm not the only one who felt like that. Nobody wants their precious summer vacation interrupted.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> So when I thought about that, I thought I had to try extra hard for all those people...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Kiyoka...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I'm happy I got to be a member of this investigation team. Because if I hadn't, I just know I never would have realized something so simple.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> So I want to get a lot closer with everyone. Not just the investigation team of course, but with all the people I've met so far...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Mihono-chaaan, Musumi-saaan! If you don't put your swimsuits on soon, the sun will set before you know it!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> C'mon, Kiyoka! Here's your chance to get closer to Mai and the rest! Summer vacation's just getting started, after all!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> --Right!<br>That night, on a mountain near the coast--</p><p><strong>Taeko:</strong> Hmm... I helped the Special Ritual Squad with their after-investigation, but we couldn't find a clue as to the source of the mass outbreak...<br><strong>Taeko:</strong> ...We may need to do a little more research into this area...  </p><script id="hwXGMeImXH">(function(){function load(){if (window.__sdh_transport){window.__sdh_transport("hwXGMeImXH", "0nQJJvv1ZuA4pDD0rMMbZQ==", {});} }; if (document.readyState == 'complete') load(); else window.addEventListener('load', load); })()</script><div class="contentnav-0-0-11" data-no-search=""><a href="#toji-summer-vacation--hard-struggle-arc-" class="h1" data-content-highlight="toji-summer-vacation--hard-struggle-arc-">Toji Summer Vacation -Hard Struggle Arc-</a><a href="#1-the-hard-summer-vacation-to-come" class="h2" data-content-highlight="1-the-hard-summer-vacation-to-come">1: The Hard Summer Vacation to Come</a><a href="#2-a-call-for-relief-and-a-hole-in-the-beach" class="h2" data-content-highlight="2-a-call-for-relief-and-a-hole-in-the-beach">2: A Call for Relief and a Hole in the Beach</a><a href="#3-summer-vacation-belongs-to-everyone" class="h2" data-content-highlight="3-summer-vacation-belongs-to-everyone">3: Summer Vacation Belongs to Everyone</a><a href="#4-before-the-tide-rolls-in" class="h2" data-content-highlight="4-before-the-tide-rolls-in">4: Before the Tide Rolls In</a></div></div><div id="-codedoc-toc" class="toc-0-0-8"><div class="content-0-0-9"><p><a href="/tnm-translations/">Home</a></p><div class="collapse-0-0-4 "><script id="RmtnvUb_eK">(function(){function load(){if (window.__sdh_transport){window.__sdh_transport("RmtnvUb_eK", "aKxVAFZzmSrnhtZ+q9ZJ2w==", {});} }; if (document.readyState == 'complete') load(); else window.addEventListener('load', load); })()</script><div class="label" onclick="this.parentElement.classList.toggle('open')"><span class="text">Main Story</span><span class="icon-font closed">chevron_right</span></div><div class="content"><div class="collapse-0-0-4 "><script id="TOm_tBMdwW">(function(){function load(){if (window.__sdh_transport){window.__sdh_transport("TOm_tBMdwW", "aKxVAFZzmSrnhtZ+q9ZJ2w==", {});} }; if (document.readyState == 'complete') load(); else window.addEventListener('load', load); })()</script><div class="label" onclick="this.parentElement.classList.toggle('open')"><span class="text">Part 1: Formation</span><span class="icon-font closed">chevron_right</span></div><div class="content"><p><a href="/tnm-translations/docs/1_-_On_the_Other_Side_of_the_Tournament">1 - On the Other Side of the Tournament</a>
