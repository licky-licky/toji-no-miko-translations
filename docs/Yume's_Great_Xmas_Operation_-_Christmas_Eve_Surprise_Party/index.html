Wait, how are you supposed to do this anyway? Geez-, why doesn&#x27;t this book explain things right?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Since Yomi-onee-san&#x27;s birthday is on the 24th, I was gonna surprise her by making a cake without going to Maki-onee-san or Suzuka-onee-san for help, but this is too hard!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I can&#x27;t tell what it&#x27;s saying when it&#x27;s just a book full of recipes-.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Tsubakuro-san? What are you doing in here?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> O-Onee-san! That&#x27;s what I should be asking you; what are you doing here?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I&#x27;d thought about making some cookies for Sayaka-chan. These ingredients... Were you baking some sweets too, Tsubakuro-san?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Yeah. I was getting ready for the 24th. I was thinking, after I call everyone over and the party starts, that&#x27;s when I&#x27;ll bring out a cake I made myself and really surprise Yomi-onee-san and everyone.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> (On the 24th... So a Christmas Eve party. I&#x27;m sure that if Tsubakuro-san did make a Christmas cake, everyone in the elite guard would be very surprised.)<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> If it&#x27;s alright with you, can we make it together?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> You&#x27;ll do that?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Of course I will. The 24th of December only comes around once a year, so we might as well make a big celebration out of it.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Thanks! Oh, yeah! It&#x27;ll be a bigger party if there&#x27;s more people, so can you and your friends all come too?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Can I? I&#x27;m glad you asked! Then, let&#x27;s look forward to the 24th and do all we can to prepare together.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Wow, I mixed it just like you said to, Onee-san, and now it&#x27;s looking a lot more like cake batter!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Fufu, you&#x27;re a quick learner, Tsubakuro-san, so it&#x27;s fun showing you how it&#x27;s done.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I&#x27;m figuring out what to do with the cake, but we have to get everything else ready too, don&#x27;t we? Will you help me out with that too, Onee-san?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Of course I will. Since we&#x27;re going through with this, I want to make it as grand a party as I can!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Hooray-!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Since we&#x27;ve decided on that, I&#x27;d like to have more friends helping us with the rest. I&#x27;ll try asking around.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> A Christmas Eve party!? That sounds fun! Sure, I&#x27;ll help!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> You might be right. It&#x27;s not a bad idea bringing everyone together at the end of the year to celebrate. I&#x27;ll lend a hand too.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> It sounds like too much work, but Ellen gets annoying bugging me to come help. I&#x27;ll just get it over with and join you.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Thank you, all of you! I&#x27;m going to go ask around some more, so I&#x27;ll meet you in the cooking classroom later.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Wow, you got all these people to help get the party ready?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Yep, I told them I wanted to throw a big party for the occasion, and they all volunteered.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Hey, I didn&#x27;t volunteer or anything.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Shichinosato-san is here to work as payment for eating Kitora-san&#x27;s share of pudding. Isn&#x27;t that right?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> That&#x27;s correct. I&#x27;ll have you repay this year&#x27;s debts before the year is done. Now then, everyone, in order to welcome the 24th as best we can, let&#x27;s get to work at once.<br>
<strong>Mihono/Hiyori/Mai:</strong> Yeah-!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> (I didn&#x27;t think this many people would come help to celebrate Yomi-onee-san&#x27;s birthday!)<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Tsubakuro-san? Is something the matter?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I-It&#x27;s nothing. Thanks for bringing everyone here, Onee-san. Let&#x27;s throw a good party.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Sure!<br>
<strong>Announcement:</strong> Aradama have appeared in the surrounding city, toji are to intercept at once. I repeat--<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Aradama!? Geez-, could they have picked a worse time to show up-?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> This sure is some bad timing. But still, if we want to make sure everyone can enjoy the party, we should finish our duties first.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Yeah, I&#x27;m not letting them stop us no matter what! I&#x27;ll take them all out in a second!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="2-the-two-slightly-off-the-same-page"></a>2: The Two Slightly Off the Same Page<a class="hash-link" href="#2-the-two-slightly-off-the-same-page" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Mai:</strong> It&#x27;s a good thing those aradama were dealt with safely, isn&#x27;t it.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Yeah. I punished them as good as I could, so hopefully they don&#x27;t show up anymore...<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Hm? By the way, did you see Mihono-chan and the others? Where could they have gone.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Asakura Mihono said she was going to practice her singing, and she took Ban Tsugumi and Shichinosato Kofuki with her to the music room.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> (Singing? ...Oh, that makes sense. The happy birthday song is a really important part of birthdays. I&#x27;m happy they&#x27;d go as far as to practice singing it!)<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> We can&#x27;t have the party without singing, after all!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> That&#x27;s true. This will definitely help liven up the party.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> (Fufu, a choir singing carols? It&#x27;s so Christmas-y that I can&#x27;t wait to hear it! We&#x27;ll have to get Santa and reindeer themed outfits ready for people too.)<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Kitora-san, can I ask you to take care of costumes?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Costumes!? You&#x27;re going to get stuff like that for the party too?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Since we&#x27;re putting on this party, I&#x27;d like to do all we can to make it extravagant. I&#x27;ll go ahead and work on providing the costumes then.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Now it&#x27;s just the two of us again, Tsubakuro-san. In the meantime, how about we continue working on preparing the cake and feast?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Sure-!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> There you are, Tsubakuro-san.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Y-Yomi-onee-san!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> (No way, why is she here? What do I do... If she finds out I&#x27;m making a cake, the surprise&#x27;ll be... I need to fool her, but how, umm...)<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> If you have a moment, Satsuki-san, what sort of Christmas songs do you like?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Huh? Christmas songs?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> None in particular... If I had to say something, I prefer them to have a peaceful melody, as it&#x27;s calming.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> (Oh, I get it! She asked her something totally unrelated to naturally move away from the cake! Onee-san&#x27;s good at this.)<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> That aside, Tsubakuro-san, Yukari-sama is calling for you. Please return to Yukari-sama&#x27;s quarters at once.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Eh-, do I have to go right now? I&#x27;m kind of in the middle of something though...<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> If the head of the Origami family is calling for you, you&#x27;ll just have to go. I&#x27;ll take care of the rest, so you should go see her, Tsubakuro-san.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Okaaay. I&#x27;m going then.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I&#x27;ll be back as soon as I can, so you have to keep the surprise a secret from Yomi-onee-san, okay?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> You look like you&#x27;re preparing for something. Would you like me to assist you?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> (Tsubakuro-san said she wanted to keep the fact that she&#x27;s making a cake a secret from the elite guard... I know! I&#x27;ll distract her by asking her to take care of something else.)<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Satsuki-san, could you help with getting the feast ready at the kitchen counter over there? We&#x27;re doing the cooking for a Christmas Eve celebration party.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I see, so that&#x27;s what you were preparing for. I understand. If you need celebratory food, red bean rice is a must have.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I&#x27;m baaack~! Wait, huh? Why is Yomi-onee-san doing the cooking!?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Eh? Tsubakuro-san, what&#x27;s wrong? Why do you look so panicked?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> What about you, Onee-san!? Why are you acting so calm about this! I mean, the party on the 24th is for...<br>
<strong>Announcement:</strong> Aradama have appeared, aradama have appeared. Toji are to intercept at once. I repeat--<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> And why do aradama have to show up now!? Geez-, we have to get things ready as fast as we can!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> There&#x27;s nothing we can do about them appearing this often. Let&#x27;s all combine our efforts to deal with them again.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Boo-. If I have to then-. Let&#x27;s go right away then.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Please wait a moment. There isn&#x27;t much time left before the 24th, so Tsubakuro-san, please stay here and continue working on the party preparations.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Huh?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Let&#x27;s leave, Yanase-san.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Right!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> It&#x27;s Yomi-onee-san&#x27;s own birthday party, but, asking me to please work on the preparations, she must be super excited for it! Was she always like that?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> But, more importantly, the surprise got out! Onee-san couldn&#x27;t keep her mouth shut~! What should I do now-!?  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="3-the-outcome-of-the-surprise"></a>3: The Outcome of the Surprise...<a class="hash-link" href="#3-the-outcome-of-the-surprise" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>On the day of the party.</p><p><strong>Suzuka:</strong> As one might expect, after spreading the word to toji throughout the Five Traditions, there&#x27;s quite a number of people here tonight.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> By the way, I haven&#x27;t seen Yume anywhere in a while. Do you know where she went?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> If you&#x27;re looking for Tsubakuro-san, she&#x27;s shut herself up in the cooking classroom getting things ready for the party.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yume is cooking? That&#x27;s rather surprising.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Tsubakuro-san, I&#x27;ve started decorating the cake, but would you like to do it together with me?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> No thanks. There&#x27;s other things I have to do...<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> (Tsubakuro-san seems to be in sort of a bad mood, but I wonder why...)<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Sigh... It might not be a surprise anymore, but I&#x27;ve gotta at least make a sign that goes on top of the cake...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Uhh, I&#x27;ll take this big cookie, and write on top with a chocolate pen, &quot;Happy Birthday, Yomi-onee-san.&quot; There...<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Tsubakuro-san, I&#x27;ve finished decorating the cake, so will you come check how it turned out? I tried making it look a little fancy, but what do you think?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ehhh!? This is just a Christmas cake!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Eh? Yes... It is a Christmas cake. ...Wait? Tsubakuro-san, what did you write on that cookie...<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Wait, don&#x27;t tell me, is today Satsuki-san&#x27;s birthday!?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh-!? You helped me out without even knowing that? Didn&#x27;t I tell you at the start, we&#x27;re doing a celebration party on the 24th...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ahhh! Wait, Onee-san, did you think we were doing a party celebrating Christmas Eve!?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I-I did. You mentioned the 24th, so I was sure you meant Christmas Eve...<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I see now. So that&#x27;s why it sometimes felt like we were talking about two different things. I&#x27;m sorry, I gave myself the wrong idea, and even had Satsuki-san herself help with it.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> No, it&#x27;s not your fault then. I&#x27;m sorry too, for getting upset with you.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> It&#x27;s alright. I feel much better now that that mystery is cleared up. But still, what are we going to do about the cake? I gave it the most Christmas-y decorations I could come up with.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Hmm, there&#x27;s not a lot of time left, so if we get rid of the Santa decoration and put this cookie on, it&#x27;ll look a little more like a birthday cake. I&#x27;m taking the Santa off.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Wait! Just leave the cookie where it is for now! I just came up with a good idea.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> A good idea?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> If we take advantage of the situation, we can still surprise Satsuki-san.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Wait, what? What do you mean-? I don&#x27;t really get it, but this sounds fun!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Now, everyone, the Christmas cake you&#x27;ve all been waiting for is ready to be presented! This cake was made with the combined efforts of Tsubakuro Yume and Yanase Mai.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Tadah! Look, look! Me and Onee-san made this cake together!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I only helped with it a little, so first, we&#x27;d like for the elite guard to have a taste of the cake Tsubakuro-san made herself.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Yume made a cake by herself!? I can&#x27;t believe it.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> So this was the big surprise she was excited about. It&#x27;s very well made.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes, I never would have thought Tsubakuro-san could make such a fine cake. I&#x27;m surprised.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ehehe, you&#x27;re surprised? But you know, the best part is what&#x27;s next?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> A blackout!?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> An aradama might be responsible. I&#x27;ll get my okatana at once...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> You don&#x27;t have to do any of that-. Onee-sans, are you ready? One, two-!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi/Mihono/Kofuki:</strong> Happy birthday to you~. Happy birthday to you~. Happy birthday, dear...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Yomi-onee-san~. Happy birthday to you~.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Oh my, Yomi-san! On top of the Christmas cake, there&#x27;s a big birthday message!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Wasn&#x27;t this a Christmas Eve party today?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Hooray-! The surprise was a big success!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Mmhm! Isn&#x27;t that great, Tsubakuro-san.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Thanks to the mixup between Yanase Mai and Tsubakuro Yume, Satsuki Yomi was brought here under the pretense of a Christmas party, and the surprise was highly successful. It may have been accidental, but it played out perfectly.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Everyone, I&#x27;m sorry you had to do all this for my sake. This can be a Christmas party from here on out, so I hope you can enjoy yourselves as you planned...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> There&#x27;s no backing out of it, Yomi-onee-san-. Tonights stars are you and all the Santas, right?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> That&#x27;s right. This is a birthday party and a Christmas Eve party. We have an outfit ready for you too, Satsuki-san. Here, please get changed!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> My, and how adorable it is! It would fit Yomi-san perfectly. Eh? You have one for me as well? Come along, Yomi-san, let&#x27;s get changed.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Satsuki-san and them finished changing, so, after the birthday song, our choir is gonna sing Christmas carols!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Will those of you in reindeer and Santa outfits come forward. Now, let&#x27;s all have a dance!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Kyahaha-! That Santa outfit looks really good on you, Yomi-onee-san!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> She seemed to have no idea, so the surprise was a big success, wasn&#x27;t it?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Yeah! Onee-san, thanks a bunch. And also, Merry Christmas!  </p><div class="videoWrapper"><iframe width="640" height="480" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XL33MXyxw44?t=6708"></iframe></div><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="4-kanami-and-hiyoris-christmas-eve"></a>4: Kanami and Hiyori&#x27;s Christmas Eve<a class="hash-link" href="#4-kanami-and-hiyoris-christmas-eve" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Kanami:</strong> That was a fun party, wasn&#x27;t it! And you were so cute dressed up like a reindeer, Hiyori-chan. See, look! I took a ton of pictures!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Kh, you took so many so fast it&#x27;s practically a video... What were you even going to do with all these photos?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> You were too cute, so I just had to. Ahh~, I&#x27;m having such a good time it&#x27;s gonna be hard coming back down to reality-.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I&#x27;ve got it! If we go out around town, the Christmas lights might be up! Hiyori-chan, let&#x27;s go check it out together.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> You want to do a walk through the night? Well, that doesn&#x27;t sound so bad.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> There&#x27;s not a single sign of Christmas down this street.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Uuuu, who&#x27;d have thought even here would still be the same as usual...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Sorry about this, Hiyori-chan. I made you come out with me and all...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> You don&#x27;t have to mind me.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Still... I thought I&#x27;d finally get to enjoy something Christmas-y with you. Uuu...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Kanami... Guess I might as well do it now. I was going to leave this by your pillow tomorrow morning, but... Here. This is for you.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> A cute box with a ribbon on it... Hiyori-chan, what is this?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Y... Your Christmas present. I had to give something back for all the help you&#x27;re always giving me.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Eh-- A Christmas present from Hiyori-chan!? For me? Can I have it? I can really have it?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> I said it&#x27;s for you, so just take it already. It might not seem like anything special either...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> No way; I&#x27;ll be happy no matter what I get from you, Hiyori-chan.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> And, besides...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Kanami? What are you looking all flustered for now?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> (I never even thought about a Christmas present. What should I do... Umm, what can I come up with quick at a time like this...)<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Oh, right! I can do that! Let&#x27;s see, I&#x27;ll take a notepad and colored marker...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> What&#x27;s going on, Kanami? You just started writing a note out of nowhere...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> And done-! Here you go, Hiyori-chan! This is my Christmas present to you! It&#x27;s a ticket to have a sparring match anytime.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Heh...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Huh? Normally you&#x27;d say something to make fun of me there.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Go ahead and open the box I gave you.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> What&#x27;s in it? Umm...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> No way-! It&#x27;s a handwritten &quot;We&#x27;ll have a sparring match whenever you want&quot; ticket!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> That&#x27;s crazy! We both thought up the same thing on our own. That kinda makes me happy.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> I couldn&#x27;t think of anything Christmas like to give you.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Then, let&#x27;s use these and do something Christmas like! Come on, hurry, hurry-!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> H-Hey, Kanami! Don&#x27;t grab my hand and start running like that! It&#x27;s dangerous.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> This is...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Last year, they had this big tree decorated here, so I thought maybe they did it again! It&#x27;s as pretty as last year...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> It sure is. I thought that, wherever you go around Christmas, there&#x27;d be people everywhere, but there isn&#x27;t a single person here before us. It&#x27;s nice and quiet.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> It feels a little strange, doesn&#x27;t it? Spending Christmas Eve alone together at the place where we first met.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Heh... That&#x27;s true...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Anyway, let&#x27;s get right to our match! Are you ready to go, Hiyori-chan?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Sure, I&#x27;m ready for you anytime.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> (A sparring session all alone with Hiyori-chan, lit under the light of a Christmas tree! This turned into the best Christmas ever.)  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="5-maki-and-suzukas-christmas-eve"></a>5: Maki and Suzuka&#x27;s Christmas Eve<a class="hash-link" href="#5-maki-and-suzukas-christmas-eve" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Maki:</strong> Today was a completely unexpected surprise. What a nice party this was.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> It was. It should make for a good report to Yukari-sama. Hm? But where did the star of the night, Yomi-san go off to?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Yomi-onee-san said she was too tired from people celebrating her, so she left as soon as the party was over.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I see. Then, it&#x27;s about time we excused ourselves too.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I want to help those onee-sans clean up until the end, so you go back without me, Maki-onee-san, Suzuka-onee-san. I&#x27;ll see you later.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> It&#x27;s just you and me now. Why don&#x27;t we head home?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> H-Hang on a moment. Maki-san, it is the night of Christmas Eve, so why not go and see some Christmas lights?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Christmas lights?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yes. It&#x27;s a bit out of the way, but I know of an incredibly beautiful spot.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Sure, it&#x27;s not a bad idea to take detours from time to time. Let&#x27;s go see it together.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Oh my! What a happy accident, that the lights were so much more elaborate than I had thought.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> You were right, it really is beautiful... Though, I didn&#x27;t expect to see this big a crowd at night in the middle of winter.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Suzuka, be careful so we don&#x27;t lose each other...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> And as soon as I said that, she&#x27;s already gone. Suzuka! Oiii, Suzuka!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Maki-san, what&#x27;s the matter? You were shouting my name so loudly.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Well, you just went and vanished on me... With all these people around us, we might get separated again. Here, hold onto my hand.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Eh-- Maki-san...?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> What&#x27;s wrong, Suzuka? Your face is red.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Th-That&#x27;s only... It&#x27;s only because of the reflection of the lights!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Uh, none of the lights around here are red. Ah-- Don&#x27;t tell me, did you start catching a cold?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> No, that&#x27;s not the case...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> We can&#x27;t afford to ignore colds this time of year. Let&#x27;s check right away to see if you&#x27;ve got a fever. Suzuka, let me see your forehead.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Ma-Maki-san!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> (Right in front of all these people...)<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> What is it? If you don&#x27;t hold still, it&#x27;s hard for me to tell.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...........................<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Hmm... It feels like you maybe have a little bit of a fever.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> We can&#x27;t let it get worse, with the night wind blowing on you. Here, I&#x27;ll lend you my scarf.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> No, that won&#x27;t be necessary. This fever isn&#x27;t being caused by a cold...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> There&#x27;s no point in holding back now. Here, I&#x27;ll wrap you up in it.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Okay, there you go. We&#x27;ve had our fill of the Christmas lights, so why don&#x27;t we get you home?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> It looks like the crowds keep going up ahead. Be sure not to let go of my hand.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> O-Of course.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> The north winds sure are blowing strong today.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I&#x27;m perfectly warm wrapped in your scarf, but are you feeling cold, Maki-san?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Oh, I&#x27;ll be fine. I&#x27;ve got the heat of your hand keeping me warm.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Honestly...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> (This year&#x27;s Christmas Eve will be a fine thing to remember. I&#x27;ll have to offer my gratitude to Santa Claus...)</p></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="theme-doc-footer-edit-meta-row row"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations/edit/docs/Yume&#x27;s_Great_Xmas_Operation_-_Christmas_Eve_Surprise_Party.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="theme-edit-this-page"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_2_ui" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_13-_"></div></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"></div></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_35-E thin-scrollbar"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#1-lets-get-things-ready-for-the-24th" class="table-of-contents__link">1: Let&#39;s Get Things Ready for the 24th!</a></li><li><a href="#2-the-two-slightly-off-the-same-page" class="table-of-contents__link">2: The Two Slightly Off the Same Page</a></li><li><a href="#3-the-outcome-of-the-surprise" class="table-of-contents__link">3: The Outcome of the Surprise...</a></li><li><a href="#4-kanami-and-hiyoris-christmas-eve" class="table-of-contents__link">4: Kanami and Hiyori&#39;s Christmas Eve</a></li><li><a href="#5-maki-and-suzukas-christmas-eve" class="table-of-contents__link">5: Maki and Suzuka&#39;s Christmas Eve</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Links</div><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://pastebin.com/LdyviZ8Z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Translator anon&#x27;s pastebin<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Site source code<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Built with Docusaurus.</div></div></div></footer></div>
