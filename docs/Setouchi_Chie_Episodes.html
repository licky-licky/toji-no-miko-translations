Cherry...<br><strong>Emily:</strong> Chie, Cherry, it's all the same, isn't it?<br><strong>Emily:</strong> Ahh, I almost forgot. Today's request is about that thing handed down through the Mashiko family. You know.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Thing? You mean Nene? He's always hanging around Mashiko-san. What do you want with him?<br><strong>Emily:</strong> Mm, first, take a look at this recording. 3... 2... 1... Begin playback!<br><strong>Emily:</strong> Well? How'd you like my camerawork?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> I already know the answer, but... Are you always doing this stuff?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Filming the Special Ritual Squad like that is already breaking regulations, but... You're really bothering them by getting in their way to film while they're trying to actually work...<br><strong>Emily:</strong> ...Ahem. Now then, take a look at this part again. Mashiko Kaoru-san's okatana, Nenekirimaru, goes flying through the air.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> She threw it, didn't she?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> I'm more interested in why Mashiko-san was just standing around doing nothing in the middle of a mission, actually.<br><strong>Emily:</strong> More importantly, take a closer look at this analysis with a slow motion camera. Here you can see Nene pulling it along.<br><strong>Emily:</strong> It's not necessarily in the field my research team is covering, but... For an aradama to make an okatana fly like that... Don't you see the potential here?<br><strong>Emily:</strong> If we could reproduce the effects by lining an okatana's mountings with noro... No, if we could reproduce Nene itself through cloning perhaps, more toji would be able to make use of this flying okatana technique.<br><strong>Emily:</strong> Now this is where you come in, Cherry. I need you to go out and capture this "Nene"...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Emily?<br><strong>Emily:</strong> Of course, I will pay you for this...<br><em>Chie gives Emily a noogie</em></p><p><strong>Chie:</strong> Stop talking. There's no way I'd help you with something as horrible as capturing Mashiko-san's important partner!<br><strong>Emily:</strong> Ow ow! Grinding my forehead like that is off limits! Really! You're always so kind to your juniors, Cherry! Why won't you be my onee-san too!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> ...We're in the same grade, you know. You're a little old for that.<br><strong>Emily:</strong> Now that you mention it!  </p><h2 id="2-the-girl-who-was-a-crybaby" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>2: The Girl Who Was a Crybaby</h2><p><strong>Chie:</strong> It's been a while, Yoshizumi-san.<br><strong>Asakura Yoshizumi:</strong> Oh, Chie-san. You don't have to be so formal. I don't mind if you call me Grandpa like you used to.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Then, Grandpa Asakura... It really does feel more natural. You should go back to calling me Chie-chan too.<br><strong>Yoshizumi:</strong> I see, so you've been working as a toji at Osafune. Does that mean you've grown out of being "Crybaby Chii-chan"?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Please don't bring that up. That was a long time ago...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> ......<br><strong>Yoshizumi:</strong> Hm? What's wrong?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Maybe I haven't grown out of it. All I ever do is find things to cry about. I keep making new regrets.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> When we were kids, Mihono-chan went to stop some older boys from picking on me, and she ended up getting hurt...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Even at Minoseki, it's thanks to me that she ended up fighting her friend... And it's all my fault she got wrapped up in this to begin with...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> ...I'm sorry, Grandpa. I feel like... I have to apologize. It's all because of me that Mihono-chan is in this mess...<br><strong>Yoshizumi:</strong> ...That's not true. Don't worry, Mihono got into this of her own accord. I have no doubt she would have gotten into trouble all on her own.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> You don't know the full story! Mihono-chan did nothing wrong... She did the right thing...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> I promised back then... That I'd become a better onee-chan for her, but...<br><strong>Yoshizumi:</strong> ...Hmm. I might not know all that happened, but... I think you've become a bit too much of a perfectionist.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> ......<br><strong>Yoshizumi:</strong> Listen here.<br><strong>Yoshizumi:</strong> There's nothing wrong with striving to be perfect. But people don't always expect the best from others. It might sound cruel, but that's normal.<br><strong>Yoshizumi:</strong> Don't put so much pressure on yourself. If you want to be an onee-chan to her, then you should enjoy yourself while you're doing it.<br><strong>Yoshizumi:</strong> I don't know what goes through her head, but Mihono... I know that, right now, being by your side makes her very happy.<br><strong>Yoshizumi:</strong> So you should be happier about it too!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Grandpa...  </p><h2 id="3-the-secret-behind-the-ribbon" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>3: The Secret Behind the Ribbon</h2><p><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> By the way, I've been thinking this for a while, but that ribbon of yours is so fashionable, Setouchi-san.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> The one I tie my hair back with?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Yes, it's very stylish. I couldn't help but notice it.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> As it turns out, Mihono-chan gave this to me.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Asakura-san did?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Yes. It was a gift from Mihono-chan, when we were split up after I moved away from Gifu to Okayama.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Really? That's so cute; giving a ribbon as a parting gift. I wonder what feelings she wanted you to carry with it?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Fufu. Actually, this ribbon was cut in two. Mihono-chan kept the other half. She wanted it to feel like, even if we were apart, we'd always be together.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> That's what she promised me, but...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Oh! You two! More aradama showed up! Let's get in formation!<br><strong>Kiyoka/Chie:</strong> !!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> ...That seems like the last of them.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Y-Yes. I hope so. So, about what you were saying before... Do you think Mihono-san still remembers that ribbon?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> I'm not sure? It wouldn't surprise me if she forgot.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Eh? What's up? You're talking about Chii-nee's ribbon? Sure I remember!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> !?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Huh? Well of course I would; it's really important to me. I tied it to my bed back at the dorms, like a protection charm.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> We suddenly got pulled into this investigation team though, so I didn't have a chance to bring it with me.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Wait, you mean you didn't see it when you were in my room, Chii-nee?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> O-Oh, I, uh... Sorry, I must not have noticed~. Maybe I was just distracted by how cute your sleeping face looked, Mihono-chan?  </p><h2 id="4-sing-my-fellow-toji" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>4: Sing! My Fellow Toji</h2><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> Since everyone's got nothing better to do, let's start the karaoke tournament~!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> It's not really a tournament, you know.<br><strong>Sasano Miyako:</strong> And some of us do have better things to do.<br><strong>Miyako:</strong> Still, I didn't think the school had a karaoke room. What is this place?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> They use this for school festivals. They let us rent out the latest equipment too.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> This sounds like fun. We haven't done anything like karaoke since we formed the investigation team.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...Tch.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Fukki's not getting into it... I wish Mirja-san could have joined us too.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Being the captain keeps her busy. Um, here, you're up first, Hono-chan.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I'm on it!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Everyone's such good singers~. Miyako-san knows so many western songs, Kiyoka did all those trendy songs, and Fukki... Well, you just kept singing the same one over and over again. Four whole times.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> It's the only one I know! You got a problem with that!?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That only leaves Chie-san. From the start, all she's been doing is picking out songs for Hono-chan. Does she not plan on singing?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah... You're right... I didn't get to choose a single song! Everyone else did it, so you sing too, Chii-nee!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Eh? Well, I'm... You know?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Chie-san, I want to hear you sing too! Please sing for us!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Really? Well, if you're all asking...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Come to think of it, I've got no clue what kind of music Chii-nee is into...<br><strong>Miyako:</strong> Well, you'll find out soon enough. A pro like her's about to put us all to shame.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> A pro!? Is she going to sing a really adult love song or something?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Or maybe she'll sing jazz!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Or something unexpected, like death metal... Ah... Chie-san took out her smart phone.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> She must already have a karaoke app. She seems really used to this.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...!?

Thank you so much, you two.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> You're the one who's always saving us, Chii-nee. But today we got to pay you back, right, Kiyoka!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah, yes. I, um... I was useful too, wasn't I?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Mmhm, you're so strong, Kiyoka-chan. But I feel so safe with Mihono-chan watching over me. It's like you don't need my support anymore.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Really!? We can take care of ourselves now! It's official!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Th-That's troubling though... At the very least, if I could still stay in the back...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Okay, okay, you two have outgrown your onee-san~. Now let's clean things up here. Mihono-chan, you were scratched, so take care of that.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Fukki-! Give me a bandage! A bandage!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Huh!? Use one of your own!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Sorry, I used up the last of ours...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Tch, then take whatever...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Thanks!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> (They've really grown...)<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> What's the matter, Setouchi Chie-san?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> It's nothing...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> No, it's bothering me. I thought I'd always be their onee-chan, but look at them now...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> If anything, they're the ones protecting me now.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> It was pretty arrogant of me to think I'd always have to look after them, wasn't it...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I see...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah! I found a bandage!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Nice, Kiyoka! High five! ...Ah!!

This one's not cute, which is perfect for you.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> I'm not sure I like that last part, but... This is nice too.

This's pretty normal.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I think both of them would suit you fine.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Um... I suppose that's fine then, but...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> If you've got something you're looking for, then just say it.

I'll... give it a try.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Still, I wish we had a few more people here to come up with something.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> There's no helping it. Hono-chan had something she had to take care of, and the others are all away on missions.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Well, no use talking about who's not here, I guess. The two of us'll have to come up with something that'll fit Chichie.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Thank you for coming out with me today, you two.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> But... I'm sorry. In the end, I wound up choosing a ribbon with a design like the one I already had.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Don't worry about that! It was fun picking out a ribbon with you, Chie-san!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> I mean, if you say that's what you want, then it's fine, right?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> That's what you're most used to, after all.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Thank you... I'll take good care of it.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Oh? Who could be stopping by this late?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Good, you're still up, Chii-nee!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Mihono-chan? Why are you here? I thought you had gone back home today...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah, I just got back. So anyway-- Here, I got you a present!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> ...A ribbon? Don't tell me... When you said you had something to take care of today, you were fixing this...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah, no, that's not it. Actually, when I first got this ribbon, it came in a set of two.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> ...It did?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> When you look that surprised about it, it's kinda awkward.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> And anyway, think about it. If you were going to split the same ribbon between two people, wouldn't you normally just buy two of the same ribbon?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> That's... true, I suppose. But, if you had this, then... Why did we split one ribbon in two back then?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I thought, if we did it that way, then you wouldn't forget about me.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> ...Of all things. Even if you hadn't done that, you know I could never forget about you.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> So then, you went back home to get this?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah. I'd totally forgotten where I'd left it, so it took me all this time to find.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> But... Chii-nee. This one's also the real ribbon from back then.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Will you take it?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> ...Thank you, Mihono-chan.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> The ribbon I got from the others...

Maybe it's to make it easier for visitors to see his face?<br><strong>Kazari:</strong> Ah, that sounds like it could be the reason why.<br><strong>Kazari:</strong> What should we do next? There were other places I wanted to go see, but it's probably going to get dark soon.<br><strong>Ruiko:</strong> Still, isn't it a little early to be heading back?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> That's right, in that case, why don't we go get something sweet to eat? There's a place I want to visit.<br><strong>Ruiko:</strong> I'm all for it!<br><strong>Kazari:</strong> I can't wait!<br><strong>Ruiko:</strong> Ahh-, that shiruko was so good. They went all out with the azuki beans. I'm a fan now!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> The mochi was just the right size too, so it felt fine eating before dinner.<br><strong>Kazari:</strong> The cream anmitsu was delicious too. If only Misaka-san and everyone were here to taste it.<br><strong>Ruiko:</strong> Right-? I get the feeling they've been working a little too hard.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> That's true. Let's buy something to bring back as a present for them.<br><strong>Kazari:</strong> Sure! Setouchi-san, thank you very much for taking us sightseeing around Kamakura today.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> You're very welcome. I'd never taken a good look at the sights here myself, so it was fun.<br><strong>Ruiko:</strong> On top of that, you treated us to oden at that shop just now. Thanks a lot!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Fufu, it was nothing. Don't mention it.<br><strong>Ruiko:</strong> The croquettes we tried on the way were tasty too; I'm really glad you came with us, Setouchi-san!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Sanae-chan is the one who told me, if you're going into Kamakura, you have to stop by that croquette shop.<br><strong>Kazari:</strong> I see. So that was one of Iwakura-san's picks.<br><strong>Ruiko:</strong> We'll have to tell her thanks later then. Anyway, to finish off our sightseeing, let's pick out some souvenirs!<br><strong>Ruiko:</strong> What would be good-? It's gotta be something for everyone to eat, right? Since there's a lot of people, we should buy a variety of stuff.<br><strong>Ruiko:</strong> It would've been great if we had gotten some of that shiruko from before as a present.<br><strong>Kazari:</strong> I want to get some Kamakura Great Buddha candy and something else. Come to think of it, we've been eating different things all day, haven't we?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Isn't that fine? Savoring tasty foods is one of the goals of sightseeing.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> But the shops might be closing up for the day soon, so we should hurry.<br><strong>Ruiko/Kazari:</strong> Okaaay~.  </p><h2 id="railgun---chie-end-lets-make-lovely-flower-decorations-with-onee-san" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Railgun - Chie: End]: Lets Make Lovely Flower Decorations with Onee-san</h2><p><strong>Ruiko:</strong> I want to do something to thank her, you know?
