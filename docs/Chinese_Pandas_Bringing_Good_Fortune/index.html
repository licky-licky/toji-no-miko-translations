It&#x27;s amazing! The streets don&#x27;t even look like Japan anymore!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> It&#x27;s been a while since I came here, but it&#x27;s always so busy that it looks as if it&#x27;s in the middle of a festival.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> There&#x27;s cute girls all around, so I&#x27;m feeling the excitement!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Thanks for coming along with me on your day off, you two.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I should be thanking you, Mihono-chan, for inviting me on a Chinatown date with you and Tsugumi-san. My heart won&#x27;t stop racing!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing all sorts of unusual things here as well.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> That&#x27;s good to hear. Then, let&#x27;s get started on our main objective in coming here today.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Main objective? Which would be...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I was watching TV the other day, and they said, here in Chinatown, there&#x27;s these Chinese dressed panda dolls that are super popular right now!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ah-, I heard about those too! The ones that all the girls are collecting, right?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> They&#x27;re cute enough just to look at, but that&#x27;s not all! Apparently they&#x27;re also lucky item that brings you happiness!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I see, so there&#x27;s some link between the dolls and good fortune... I&#x27;d be interested in seeing more data on that.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I don&#x27;t know about the data, but if cute girls are into them, I want to get one. It might come in handy in the future.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> So, do you know where in Chinatown they might be selling these dolls?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> They&#x27;re a huge fad right now, so they said on TV that any place selling souvenirs should have them.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Though, I don&#x27;t see any on display in the stores around here.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Perhaps the special feature on TV caused their popularity to skyrocket and they sold out.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> No way... But still, there&#x27;s so many shops around here, so one of them has to be selling them! We just have to look hard enough and... Huh?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Hey, you two~, where&#x27;d you go?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Uhyaa-! The girls walking around Chinatown give Harajuku a run for its money! I might&#x27;ve found a nice secret spot to go girl watching!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Yui! We can go girl watching later, but what about the pandas...?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Whoops, sorry. When girls this pretty go walking by, I can&#x27;t help myself from following them.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> But don&#x27;t you worry! You and Tsugumi-san are my honeys today!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> O-Okay. Thanks.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> So come on, honey, let&#x27;s go find you what you wanted! ...Wait? Where&#x27;s Tsugumi-san?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> She was gone before I knew it...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Wait!? Over in front of that shady looking shop...<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> A Chinese herbal medicine store, operating for generations here in Chinatown... The product of four thousand years of Chinese efforts could prove useful in bolstering toji&#x27;s abilities...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> She looks like she&#x27;s having a good time, so maybe we should leave her be...<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Ah-- I&#x27;m sorry. We were going to help Asakura-san with her shopping first, weren&#x27;t we. I should have been more mindful...<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Still, none of the souvenir shops we&#x27;ve seen have been selling them, have they?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Uuuu... I wonder why.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Don&#x27;t lose hope yet! Maybe they have a still have a ton of them in the back! We should ask the shopkeeper! Excuse me!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> We were looking for the pandas wearing Chinese clothes that were on TV the other day.<br>
<strong>Shopkeeper:</strong> Sorry, but to tell the truth, aradama showed up here in Chinatown this morning, and...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Don&#x27;t tell me... They stole the pandas!?<br>
<strong>Shopkeeper:</strong> Mmm, not so much as stole them, but... They went rampaging around and the pandas got caught up in them?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I see. There are an endless amount of forms an aradama can take. Many of them could easily ensnare an object by accident.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Whoa whoa wait, no matter how easy it would be, wouldn&#x27;t it be weird for all the pandas to get grabbed like that!? Don&#x27;t you think the aradama are stealing them after all!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> If that&#x27;s the case... There is a high possibility these aradama have caught onto the fad and are all collecting the dolls.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Okay okay okay, Chinatown&#x27;s pandas are just so popular, even in the netherworld, that there&#x27;s just not enough for everyone~ like I&#x27;m gonna be happy with thaaaat!!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> And we just came all the way out to Chinatown to buy them too-, dangiiit!!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Hnng, Mihono-chan&#x27;s so cute when she&#x27;s frustrated! But I bet you&#x27;d look even cuter hugging a panda all happy... Alright, we can go get them back together!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I&#x27;ll join you. We might come to understand why the aradama are so fascinated by these dolls. Let&#x27;s leave at once.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> You guys... Thank you! With us together, we won&#x27;t leave a single panda behind!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="2-where-are-chinatowns-best-meat-buns-at"></a>2: Where are Chinatown&#x27;s Best Meat Buns At?<a class="hash-link" href="#2-where-are-chinatowns-best-meat-buns-at" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> Phew, we finally got a Chinese panda! Look how cute it is~!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Nnn~, Mihono-chan&#x27;s so cute with her panda~! I want a video of this I can put on an infinite loop!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I hate to spoil such a happy moment, but many more dolls still need to be recovered. Why don&#x27;t we return that to the store for now and continue suppressing aradama?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> That&#x27;s right... Uuu, Chinese panda-chan... We&#x27;ll meet again, okay... I&#x27;ll come get you for sure, I mean it...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> You just have to think positive, Mihono-chan. Once we get all of them back, we can buy as many as we want!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Oh yeah. Let&#x27;s do our best then, and beat all the aradama!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Uh... That reminds me, since I thought we were going to eat a lot in Chinatown, I skipped breakfast.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> They say you can&#x27;t fight on an empty stomach. Why don&#x27;t we find something to replenish our energy while we wait for the next aradama to show itself?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I&#x27;m all for it~. There&#x27;s so many tasty looking things around here, so what should we go with-?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Since we&#x27;re here in Chinatown, we have to at least try some meat buns!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I saw on TV, there&#x27;s this meat bun store here that&#x27;s supposed to have the most delicious meat buns, and they looked super yummy too! Can we go there?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> That sounds good. What&#x27;s the name of the place? Do you know where it is?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Umm... I completely forgot! Uuu... Sorry.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> If the store is popular, there should be a line for it, shouldn&#x27;t there? Why don&#x27;t we look for a place selling meat buns with a line out front.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Smart thinking, Tsugumi-san! But it&#x27;d help if we had any other hints. Mihono-chan, was there anything else you remember about that store?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I remember there was so much meat that the juices were all spilling out...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Sounds delicious! So we&#x27;re looking for a popular store with a line out front selling juicy meat.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> You know, the smells coming from any one of these stores are tantalizing enough to work up my appetite.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> At this point, I think I&#x27;d be fine getting meat buns from anywhere.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Just hang in there! Since we&#x27;re looking for it anyway, we might as well find the number 1 tastiest meat buns! All full of meat, and dripping with juices. I just know you won&#x27;t regret it!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Sniff, sniff, sniff... Ah, how about that place...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Yui, Tsugumi-san! This is it! We&#x27;re here-!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Seems we&#x27;ve found it at last. Let&#x27;s go join her!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Check it out, you two! In this bamboo steamer! All full of meat; in fact, it&#x27;s mostly just meat! It&#x27;s amazing!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Mm~, it smells so good! I think I&#x27;ll take a peek in there too. Let&#x27;s see... Wait, Mihono-chan!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> This is...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Huh? What&#x27;s up?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Yeah, this is full of meat, but...<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Asakura-san, these are different kind of dumpling called shumai.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah-! They are-! I got so focused on finding meat that I forgot all about looking for meat buns!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Really, what are we going to do with you, Mihono-chan? Though that clumsy side of yours is so cute too!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Uuu... Sorry I got your hopes up.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> There&#x27;s no need to apologize. These may not be meat buns, but take a look at their sign. It says they serve the best shumai in Chinatown.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> ...Wait? The shop next door has a huge line too. It looks like they&#x27;re selling meat buns...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah-! That&#x27;s the place! The one on TV! That&#x27;s crazy; we found two of Chinatown&#x27;s best right next to each other! It&#x27;s our lucky day!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Why don&#x27;t we take this chance to try both of them out! Ahh~, I&#x27;m so glad we kept on searching~.<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> Keeeeeee!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> An aradama!? Geez, why&#x27;d you have to show up now!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> It may be frustrating, but we can enjoy the shumai and meat buns after we finish fighting.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Grrh... You&#x27;re gonna pay for this, you aradama! C&#x27;mon, let&#x27;s go!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="3-the-secret-behind-chinatowns-alluring-sweets-is"></a>3: The Secret Behind Chinatown&#x27;s Alluring Sweets is...!?<a class="hash-link" href="#3-the-secret-behind-chinatowns-alluring-sweets-is" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Nicely done, you two. There should only be a small number of aradama left for us to defeat.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I wonder when the next&#x27;ll show up. It&#x27;d be nice if they all came at once so we could finish it all up.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> They probably won&#x27;t be here right away, so let&#x27;s go back to where they were selling meat buns and shumai! My tummy&#x27;s rumbling~.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Oh no...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> &quot;Sold out, closed for the day.&quot;<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> They must have sold out while we were suppressing the aradama. What now? Should we find another store?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Uuuu... We finally the place they were calling Chinatown&#x27;s best too...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Hang in there, Mihono-chan. Chinatown has more number 1s than just meat buns and shumai.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ta-dahh! Look what I&#x27;ve got! One of Kiyoka-chan&#x27;s magazines had a special feature on Chinatown, so I borrowed it!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Whoa~, all the food in here looks so tasty! Oh, there&#x27;s a tapioca juice shop. It says it gets the longest lines in Chinatown; we should go check it out!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> That sounds like a good idea. The sugar will quickly convert into energy, so it&#x27;s optimal for a pre-fight meal.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Hmmm, it looks like the tapioca shop should be straight down this street.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah-, look! That looo~ng line, maybe that&#x27;s...<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> It seems to be the store from the magazine, doesn&#x27;t it.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Uhyaa-! Look at all the cuties waiting in line! We&#x27;ve gotta line up next to them!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Okay!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I went and got their menu. What should we buy?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Look at all the flavors besides milk tea! Wow, I can&#x27;t make up my mind~!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> They all sound tasty, but... What do they make tapioca with, anyway? It&#x27;s all round and squishy.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Huh, I never thought about it. I don&#x27;t know.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> They closely resemble frog eggs, don&#x27;t they? In early spring, you can find them bunched up around ponds and riversides...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Gehh... Now that you said it, I think I see it too...<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Actually, I&#x27;ve handled both of them before, and it isn&#x27;t just their appearance that&#x27;s alike. They feel very similar to the touch as well. You know, it is spring now, so it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ehh-, I don&#x27;t think I can do this!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Hey, hang on, Mihono-chan! Where are you going-? We&#x27;re almost to the front of the line-!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I can&#x27;t eat frogs~!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I may have teased her too far. She&#x27;s long gone.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ahh, I can&#x27;t believe it... All this time, I never thought about it, but the yummy tapioca I&#x27;ve been eating was actually...<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Finally, there you are. I&#x27;m sorry about before, Asakura-san. I only meant it as a joke, but I didn&#x27;t expect you to believe me...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Eh? A joke? Then...<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Tapioca is made from starch extracted from a tuber that grows in southern countries. They roll it into round shapes and then boil it. None of its ingredients involve frogs in any way.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Wait, really~? If I&#x27;d have known that, I would&#x27;ve never left the line~!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I thought you might feel that way, so I left Yamashiro-san keeping our place in line. We were nearly at the front, so let&#x27;s go back and buy our drinks.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Really!? What a relief~! Thanks so much, Tsugumi-san!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Welcome back, you two~! You came just in time for us to order.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Thanks, Yui!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> What should I go with~? Okay, I made up my mind! I&#x27;ll have...<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> Keeeeeee!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> EHHHHH!? Why&#x27;d you have to show up right now-!?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> First the pandas, then the meat buns, then the tapioca. It seems our target aradama are sensitive to trends after all...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Arghh-! Let&#x27;s just get this over with!!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Of course, of course. Let&#x27;s proceed then.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="4-wheres-our-lucky-break"></a>4: Where&#x27;s Our Lucky Break...?<a class="hash-link" href="#4-wheres-our-lucky-break" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> Haa~, we&#x27;ve gotten rid of all the aradama, and gotten all the pandas back. Now our mission&#x27;s complete, right!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> We&#x27;ve worked hard. Now we can enjoy the sights of Chinatown at last.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> For now, why don&#x27;t we go back to that tapioca store we almost got to try?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah, let&#x27;s go back!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Oh no...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> You&#x27;ve gotta be kidding. They closed the shutters...<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> The magazine says, &quot;They close as soon as they run out of stock.&quot;<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Uuuu... First the meat buns, and now the tapioca...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Hey now, cheer up, Mihono-chan! I know you were looking forward to trying the different foods, but we still took care of your main goal today; we got the Chinese pandas, didn&#x27;t we?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> We did! After all our hard work, we got them all back. We should go pick up some for ourselves before they run out!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> She sure took off in a hurry.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Well, she did want to come to Chinatown and fight those aradama all for the pandas. We&#x27;d better catch up.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Wait for us-!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Uuuuu...<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> What&#x27;s wrong? You look disappointed. Don&#x27;t tell me...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> They&#x27;re all sold out of pandas...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ehh-!? But we got so many of them back though?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> They said news that the lucky pandas were getting returned from the aradama spread all over the web, and they sold out instantly...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Even though the whole reason I came to Chinatown was to get those pandas...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> It&#x27;s not the end of the world, Mihono-chan. If you can&#x27;t get a Chinese panda of your own, then I&#x27;ll put on a China dress and you can hug me all you want!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> While making it seem like you&#x27;re cheering someone up, you move straight into skinship. You&#x27;re a natural, Yamashiro-san.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Yui... I&#x27;ll be fine. Just... Uuuu... My pandas-!!<br>
<strong>Shopping District Helper:</strong> Excuse me, are you girls the toji who cleaned out the aradama just now?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Yes, that would be us. Is there something you needed?<br>
<strong>Shopping District Helper:</strong> I&#x27;ve been looking all over for you, to reward you for bringing our valuable merchandise back.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Eh, a reward!? Like what? Something like a full course meal of high class Chinese food?<br>
<strong>Shopping District Helper:</strong> Sorry, would you have preferred something like that? I heard you were young girls, so I only have these for you...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ehhhh---!? Chinese pandas, and three of them!!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> But weren&#x27;t they all sold out from every store?<br>
<strong>Shopping District Helper:</strong> We wanted to be sure to give something back to the toji who defeated the aradama, so everyone in the shopping district made sure to leave enough for the three of you.<br>
<strong>Shopping District Helper:</strong> This is our show of appreciation, so please, by all means, take them.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Thanks so much! Wow~, I finally got one~!! It&#x27;s so cute~!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Wasn&#x27;t that nice of them, Asakura-san. Now you&#x27;ve accomplished your starting goal.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> With these pandas, plenty of good things are sure to happen from now on!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah! Good things&#x27;ll happen for sure!

<strong>Yui:</strong> Of course I do!ã€€It&#x27;s a Chinatown date with two good looking girls at my side! This makes fighting off those aradama all worth it~.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Date~! Date~! Chinatown date~!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> You&#x27;re sure in a good mood, Yui.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> You know I am! Taking a beauty like you on a date through Chinatown; that&#x27;s the kind of classic date course I&#x27;ve been dreaming of!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Hm? What&#x27;s up, Tsugumi-san? Ah-- Don&#x27;t tell me, you&#x27;re getting jealous I&#x27;m giving Mihono-chan all the attention?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> No, not once this whole time have I ever felt anything like that...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Then, what&#x27;s that uneasy look on your face for?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Sorry, it might be senseless of me to ask, but... I was just wondering, what is the definition of a &quot;date&quot; to begin with?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Tsugumi-san, you&#x27;re such a serious going girl. When it comes to things like this, it&#x27;s all about &quot;Don&#x27;t think; feel!&quot;<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Go with your feelings without thinking... Is that it. Then, coming up with feelings regarding dating... How exactly do you do that?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> That&#x27;s easy! Right now, I&#x27;ll swap between taking you and Mihono-chan on a Chinatown date with me, to give you the dating experience!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> The dating experience?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Yeah! I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time mentally rehearsing for the ultimate heart-pounding Chinatown date, so I&#x27;ll show you a good time for sure!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> If you&#x27;re that sure then, Yamashiro-san... It might not be so bad to get an experience of the real thing.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> That&#x27;s the spirit! So then, to start us off... I think I&#x27;ll take out Mihono-chan!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ehh-- Starting with me!? If you just tell me we&#x27;re going on a date like that, I don&#x27;t have time to get my heart ready...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Don&#x27;t you worry about that, Honey. I&#x27;ll escort you around just right. Why don&#x27;t we find somewhere to get some delicious sweets first?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> This place sells the apricot seed soft serve that&#x27;s the talk of Chinatown! I don&#x27;t have much pocket money on me today, so let&#x27;s share one between us. Here, open wide.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ahhn. [chew chew]... It&#x27;s yummy-!!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Alright, now it&#x27;s your turn, Mihono-chan! I&#x27;ll say &quot;ahh&quot;, and you...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah, look, look! In that general store next door! They&#x27;ve got cute panda things you can wear!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ah, wait, Mihono-chaaan!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Tadahhh! Check it out! See this panda hat I got! Does it look good?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Mmm~! It&#x27;s good; so good~! Next up, let&#x27;s try this Chinese hat~! Uwah~! This one looks good too~.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Um, would it be alright if we stopped for a moment?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Hmmm? What&#x27;s the matter, Tsugumi-san? Hahahn~, now are you feeling jealous of me with Mihono-chan...<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> That&#x27;s not it. It&#x27;s just that, I&#x27;ve started to have my doubts about all this. Eating sweets together, and excitedly shopping. It&#x27;s true that it does seem like you two are having lots of fun, but...<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> It also seems as if nothing has changed from when the three of us were going around together before. Can you really call this an example of a date...?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> You&#x27;re right. It was a lot of fun, but if I had to say either way, this isn&#x27;t any different from everyone hanging out together, is it-?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Yamashiro-san, is it really fine to classify this under the definition of a date?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Uuu~, when you put it like that, I&#x27;m losing confidence. Could I have a little time to think this over?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Get ahold of yourself, Yui. Remember the strongest Chinatown fantasy date plan you fantasized about over and over day after day. Chinatown... Chinatown... When I think of an ideal date in Chinatown, it&#x27;s gotta be...  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="china---yui-end-a-practice-run-yuis-fantasy-chinatown-date"></a>[China - Yui: End]: A Practice Run!? Yui&#x27;s Fantasy Chinatown Date!<a class="hash-link" href="#china---yui-end-a-practice-run-yuis-fantasy-chinatown-date" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Yui:</strong> Chinatown date... Chinatown date... When I think of situations for the Chinatown date I&#x27;ve been dreaming of, there&#x27;s...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> That&#x27;ll do~!!!!!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> You look like a lightbulb went off in your head, Yui.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> She does. And, it&#x27;s somewhat unsettling...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Anyway, let&#x27;s get back into it, and swap partners! I&#x27;ll need you to be play my girlfriend now, Tsugumi-san!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> (Sigh, of course it would come to this. Though, I was the one who asked what a date was to start, so I can&#x27;t back out now, can I...)<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Understood. Then, please go easy on me.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Just leave that to me! Anyway, let&#x27;s start right off by holding hands! [squeeze~]. Woww, Tsugumi-san, your hands are so soft and warm~!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Y-Yamashiro-san! What are you doing? You got too close all of a sudden!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> See, I remembered. When you think of a date, it means the two of you are closer than friends! That means, the two of us need to have a closeness deeper than friendship.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Deeper than friendship... Is that so.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> That&#x27;s right! For example, if, while everyone&#x27;s watching, I gave you a deep kiss!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> And then, and then, if I took you someplace where no one&#x27;s around, like a park or back alley, and when it&#x27;s just the two of us, we... Ehehe... Ehehe...<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I-Is that what it means...  I think I understand the gist of it now, so don&#x27;t you think we can end our fake date here?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Y-Yeah. I think so too... The sun&#x27;s going to go down soon too, so why don&#x27;t we head home for today...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ehh-, just hang on! We were only just getting started-!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Uuuu... Just when it was looking like we were going to get into the juicy stuff; I&#x27;m such an idiot! I should have way more stuff in my stock of fantasies that&#x27;ll make girl&#x27;s hearts pound-!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ah-! I know! I have the strongest Chinatown date plan in history here! Hey, you two-, wait for me-!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I thought up the strongest Chinatown date plan! So please! Will you at least hear me walk you through it? If this doesn&#x27;t make your hearts throb, then I&#x27;ll take this as my loss!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> We weren&#x27;t competing to see if you won or lost in the first place... But, if you&#x27;re that adamant about it, we can at least hear you out.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah. It&#x27;s fine if you&#x27;re only going to talk... And plus, I&#x27;m a little curious what the strongest date plan is like!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Thanks so much, you two! It&#x27;s that kind side of you that I love so much! Anyway, I&#x27;ll get right to my presentation!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Our date starts off at a China dress shop in Chinatown! We put on matching dresses, and head out on the town!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Matching China dresses... We&#x27;re sticking to the assumption that this is a same sex female couple then...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Still, this sounds exciting! You&#x27;d be happy to wear a cute dress, wouldn&#x27;t you!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Right? So then, we eat some tasty food in Chinatown, and have a good time going around to all the cute general stores...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> That&#x27;d be fun~! But...<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Things have gone back to playing out exactly the same as before, haven&#x27;t they...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Hold your horses-! The main event starts right here!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> While the two of us are having a good time on our date, a group of burly thugs shows up and surrounds us, then tells you this:<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> &quot;Hey, pretty little thing, want to come have a good time with us...&quot;<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> That&#x27;s when the thugs try to take you away by force. But then, I shout, &quot;Get your hands off my girlfriend-!&quot; and give the guys a high kick while I&#x27;m still in my China dress!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> To protect the girl I love, I start pumping out stylish moves, taking down the punks one after another. And, completely captivated by me, my girlfriend says:<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> &quot;Thank you! I owe you my life. To make it up to you... You. Can. Have. Me...&quot;<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Kyaa-! Y&#x27;know, you&#x27;re a lot bolder than I thought... But, what kind of woman turns down a woman&#x27;s advances! Now&#x27;s not the time to hold ourselves back! And then, the two of us spend our sweet time together... Eheheheh...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> So, what do you think? Don&#x27;t you want to go on a date like that?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ummm... I want to wear a China dress, but... Everything after that is a little...<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> To begin with, it&#x27;s hard to imagine such a convenient group of thugs would appear at such convenient timing...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Come onnn... But I came up with the strongest, most exciting Chinatown fantasy date plan in history...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Wawah, Yui&#x27;s all depressed now...<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> If we were to leave her like this, it would weigh on our conscience, wouldn&#x27;t it. We have to come up with something to support her...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Yui, I think everybody has their own different kind of date they dream about, but I got to have a lot of fun today because you were with us! So thanks.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> That&#x27;s right. And, I was able to mostly understand what the definition of a date is too...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> You mean it!? I&#x27;m so glad~! I should be the one thanking you two! Getting to go on a three girl date through Chinatown made me the happiest girl in the world!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> A three girl date...? Can you really call an outing with three people a date? Sigh... I&#x27;m understanding the definition less and less.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations/edit/docs/Chinese_Pandas_Bringing_Good_Fortune.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_2_ui" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_3DPF"></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"></div></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_35-E thin-scrollbar"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#1-searching-for-pandas-in-chinatown" class="table-of-contents__link">1: Searching for Pandas in Chinatown</a></li><li><a href="#2-where-are-chinatowns-best-meat-buns-at" class="table-of-contents__link">2: Where are Chinatown&#39;s Best Meat Buns At?</a></li><li><a href="#3-the-secret-behind-chinatowns-alluring-sweets-is" class="table-of-contents__link">3: The Secret Behind Chinatown&#39;s Alluring Sweets is...!?</a></li><li><a href="#4-wheres-our-lucky-break" class="table-of-contents__link">4: Where&#39;s Our Lucky Break...?</a></li><li><a href="#china---yui-start-the-chinatown-date-ive-longed-for" class="table-of-contents__link">China - Yui: Start: The Chinatown Date I&#39;ve Longed For!?</a></li><li><a href="#china---yui-end-a-practice-run-yuis-fantasy-chinatown-date" class="table-of-contents__link">China - Yui: End: A Practice Run!?
