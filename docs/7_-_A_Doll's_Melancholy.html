Kamakura! It's only been a few days, but it feels like we were gone forever!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I know what you mean. That reminds me... I wonder what happened with my hotel room?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> My president summoned me really suddenly, so all my luggage was left in the room I was staying in during the tournament.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> That's... I'm sure someone from Heijou collected them for you. At worst, the hotel staff might be holding onto it?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Y-You're probably right... I hope they didn't... Find anything embarrassing...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Oh yeah, so that rumor about Akabane swords in Izu, that turned out to be fake, didn't it?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Hmm... I thought Aoto-kan's Youji-san was supposed to be better informed than that...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> It was, but we shouldn't blame him too much. Rumors are just rumors, after all. And thanks to that rumor, you got to see Etou-san, didn't you?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah, that's true. Ahh, I hope they made it out of there alright.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> I think they'll be fine... But the bigger concern for us is that we found out about the elite guards using noro.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Though Mirja-san said, "They overlooked it, so we shouldn't get any further involved."<br><strong>Chie:</strong> But we can't stay quiet about it forever.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> To tell the truth, I'm really confused by it. I mean, that's not something a toji should do. Injecting noro in their bodies, all for the sake of getting stronger...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> You can't do that... And still call it justice.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I'm scared. I don't know what's going to happen. Are we really doing the right thing?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It's hard to... Feel confident in that anymore...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> ......<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Oh? Kofuki-san, where are you going?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...Tch. Renpu's research building.

Well, if they're friends of yours, Shichinosato-san. Um, Asakura-san and Musumi-san, was it? Research team 16 welcomes you.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I'm the mock battle operator, Ban Tsugumi. Our team is in charge of disposing of experimental results. Though primarily, other teams come to us for practical tests of their research.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Disposing of?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> What she means is, we get rid of the aradama they experiment on. We're the team on garbage duty.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Do you... Always do that?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Isn't it great? I get to mess up aradama-chan as much as I want. Hey, Tsugumi, I came all this way, so let me in there a while.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Now now, don't be in such a rush. You said you had to check in, but the truth is you're just bored, aren't you?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Heh, you know me!

You'll be disappointed to hear this, but we ran out of the kind of aradama you like.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> You were away for a while, and in the meantime someone dropped by and disposed of them...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Huh? Who'd go and... ...!?  
<strong>???:</strong> It's me-!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Tch... Of course it was.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Bleh, I didn't think you were going to block that... I spent all that time setting up a sneak attack too; how boring.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> The aradama here are so weak that I needed a new way to kill some time...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> I had a feeling it was you...  Who said you could come in here and mess with my things!?

I heard all about it, she's strong!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> She's the one who fought off Maki onee-san and Suzuka onee-san all by herself, right!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Huh... So that's what you're after. Then you two have fun together.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ehhh!?  
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Wait! Kofuki-san!? Stop, Yume-san! The elite guard were ordered not to attack us...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> And besides, we haven't told anyone about...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I don't care about any of that stuff. I just wanna fight this onee-san!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Still, you can't just go picking fights!

You have to because you're weak.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> ....Ahhh, this just got really boring. Beating weaklings won't... I'm bored... I'm going home.<br><strong>Kiyoka/Mihono/Kofuki:</strong> .... ........ ............<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Y-You saved us~!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I was worried about what would happen next...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> ......<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Thank you, Kofuki-chan. You protected Mihono-chan and Kiyoka-chan, didn't you?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> HUH?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> That's not what happened!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Really? In any case, you made your onee-chan happy. Everyone's safe, aren't they?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Tch......<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Safe, but they seem to have been severely beaten... We're very lucky they aren't injured.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Anyway... We should leave here as soon as possible. Afterward, there's something we need to tell all of you.  </p><h2 id="9-the-location-of-the-akabane-swords" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>9: The Location of the Akabane Swords</h2><p><strong>Mirja:</strong> ...To find out who is scattering the Akabane swords, and for what purpose, we must head to Tokyo.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Scattering? You said someone is scattering them... Right?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Yes.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Yesterday, Osafune contacted Setouchi Chie-san about an anonymous informant willing to expose the reasoning behind why the Akabane swords have been found in aradama.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Our destination is the Kita ward of Tokyo, to the Akabane district itself. To meet with this informant, our investigation team has been assigned as official representatives of the Sword Administration.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It finally feels like we're doing an investigation, doesn't it? We won't have to fight any aradama or elite guards this time.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> What a relief.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Yes~.  
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Though, why would they suddenly decide to expose... I mean, why would they feel like contacting us now?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> That's true. We were curious about that as well. From what Setouchi Chie-san was able to learn over the phone, it's very likely...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> To be in response to the creation of this investigation team.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> But, Mirja-san, that would also mean...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ???<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Yes. We haven't exactly been operating with much secrecy, however, this response is still too quick.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> There may be a spy within the Sword Administration, or someone may be leaking information. Whatever the case, it's best to think all our actions are being leaked from now on.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> In fact... This informant may have contacted us with the intention of making us aware that they have access to our information.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You think it's a threat?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ......Well, maybe they're telling us to stay careful!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Maybe. I'd rather hope they mean well. That this has nothing to do with spies or research into using noro.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Right!  </p><script id="ObAkJmNEUo">(function(){function load(){if (window.__sdh_transport){window.__sdh_transport("ObAkJmNEUo", "0nQJJvv1ZuA4pDD0rMMbZQ==", {});} }; if (document.readyState == 'complete') load(); else window.addEventListener('load', load); })()</script><div class="contentnav-0-0-11" data-no-search=""><a href="#7---a-dolls-melancholy" class="h1" data-content-highlight="7---a-dolls-melancholy">7 - A Doll's Melancholy</a><a href="#1-return-1" class="h2" data-content-highlight="1-return-1">1: Return (1)</a><a href="#2-return-2" class="h2" data-content-highlight="2-return-2">2: Return (2)</a><a href="#3-return-3" class="h2" data-content-highlight="3-return-3">3: Return (3)</a><a href="#4-i-wanna-play-with-you-so-bad" class="h2" data-content-highlight="4-i-wanna-play-with-you-so-bad">4: I Wanna Play with You so Bad!</a><a href="#5-who-even-matters-to-you-1" class="h2" data-content-highlight="5-who-even-matters-to-you-1">5: Who Even Matters to You?
