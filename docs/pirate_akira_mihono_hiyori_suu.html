Now's your chance!<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Sure, leave it to me!<br><strong>Akira:</strong> You're not gettin' away, ORAAAAAHH!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Nice!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Asakura-san. There still seem to be aradama in the area we're in charge of. Approaching from 9 o'clock; be on guard.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> 9 o'clock? Wait, which way is that!?<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Left from where you're facing, Mihono!<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Yomi, are those the last of 'em?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Cool, let's finish this quick.<br><strong>Park Manager:</strong> Thank you very much. Now we can re-open for business.<br><strong>Park Manager:</strong> As a way to give our thanks, once the others are finished clearing out the aradama, would you like to enjoy our newest attraction?<br><strong>Park Manager:</strong> It's based around a theme of pirates and treasure hunting; "Treasures of the Pirates".<br><strong>Park Manager:</strong> And there were nine toji who came here today. You can make three teams of three, so it works out perfectly.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...!!<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Nah, we're good. That's a real nice offer, but we've got work to get back to.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Akira-san...<br><strong>Akira:</strong> ...Or I was thinking, but, if you're gonna extend the favor, we should have some fun after all!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> If we're in teams of three, we can just stay in the teams we're in, so we can play as soon as the mission's over!<br><strong>Park Manager:</strong> Then, I'll arrange for that. We would appreciate it if you would give us your impressions once you're done as well.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> That's a small price to pay. Thanks for having us!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I'll go let everybody know! And help them out too!<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Were you okay with this? You're probably busy.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I don't mind. I can stay with you for today.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> You sure? Sorry. Though, if we're doin' it, we might as well have fun.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> You're lookin' pretty good as pirates! The three of us'll get that hidden treasure for sure!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Aye aye sir! We have to go to the beach on the map straight away!<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Nah, first we're stealing the maps offa Yui and Suu! Loot and plunder! Cause we're pirates right now!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Oh, yeah! The rules said we can do that too, didn't they.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> It seems only one team has the correct map to begin with.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> If we board the other ships and lower their pirate flag, they have to give up their treasure map.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> If we get all the maps, our odds of finding the treasure go up. And it sounds more fun than just going around looking, right?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah! It's totally more exciting!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> There is a time limit, so please don't forget that, you two.  </p><h2 id="pirate---akira-end-alriiight-were-boarding" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Pirate - Akira: End]: Alriiight, We're Boarding!</h2><p><strong>Akira:</strong> Yo, wanna have a little fun with us?<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Give us a minute and we'll get your flag down.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> That's how this will be, so excuse us.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> You gotta get more aggressive at times like these.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ...That's not how I am.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> We were planning on picking a fight ourselves, but we were beaten to the punch.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That's mostly Captain Yui's fault though!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> And also, where's Hono-chan...?<br><strong>Akira:</strong> You can tell by looking, so I'll say she's off on her own here.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Is she protecting your flag? Or, is she sneaking over to ours. --One of those two, right?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Since it's Hono-chan... She wouldn't sit still and watch the flag. So it might be down to the captain.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I was thinking the same thing. Let's take out Inagon and Yomiyomi and get their flag, Kiyoka!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Alright!<br><strong>Akira:</strong> I'm all for a fight! Let's do this, Yomi!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Right.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Aww... So Fukki's ship won in the end?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Well, on accident.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> But still-, that means there was no point in how hard we worked getting Yui's map, so it's twice as frustrating!<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Yeah, guess not.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> But y'know, it was pretty damn fun swinging around toy swords instead of our okatana for once, right?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah-- it was like I was back to playing around as a kid again!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I get the feeling Kaoru would have fun playing this. Maybe I should invite her, when we get a day off.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Tsubakuro-san would as well. After I tell her about today, she might be eager to come here.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> ......<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> What is it?<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Nah, nothing. You'd wanna spend fun times with your buddies, wouldn't you.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ......<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Mannn, seeing Boss tearing around like a real pirate was so good!<br><strong>Akira:</strong>　Thanks, Yui. ...Might as well ask, that's a compliment, right?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> That goes without saying! I've got nothing but good things and more good things to say about girls!<br><strong>Akira:</strong> S-Sure. So, where was the treasure at anyway?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> You'd better ask her about that.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Eep... A-Ask m-me?<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Huh... Why'd she suddenly get all weird?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Isn't that... because she's scared of the way you look like a bad person, Akira?<br><strong>Akira:</strong> It's not like I did anything to her... And anyway, that's pretty blunt of you. Kinda hurt.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> I-I'm sorry... Then, if you'll let me, I'll go over in detail how we found the treasure, to... to the best of my ability!!<br><strong>Akira:</strong> You don't gotta apologize.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> I'm sorry... Ah, ah, I'm sorry...! Then, I'll begin now, if that's okay...!<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Sure... Whenever you're ready.

But, will Akira-san be fine on her own?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> She should be fine. Using cover, she drew the aradama to where they were manageable.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Then, we have to beat the aradama here and get to where Akira-san is!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ......<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> You're right.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> We've gotta give it our best!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> --YAAAAAH!<br><strong>Park Manager:</strong> Thank you very much.

It's been a while since we got to do something like this.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Well... I am on the same team as Inami Suu and Kofuki. Can't say I'm not worried.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I predict Hiyoyon and her merry friends will be a tough team to beat!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ellen-san's team with Yui and Kiyoka seems tough too, but we aren't gonna lose-!<br><strong>Akira:</strong> You tell 'em, Mihono. Let's go find that treasure for ourselves!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Hmmm. What do you think the treasure pendants'll be like?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> That's one thing to look forward to, but what I really want to see to is everybody dressed like pirates! I'll burn it deep into my eyes and plenty of photos on my phone~!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah, yeah!

Bringing down their pirate flag is actually tough...!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Fu fu fu~. And what about you, Mihono-chan? You sure you didn't want to stop us from bringing down your pirate flag?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Eh... Our ship-- Are Kiyoka and Ellen-san there already!?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Wait... Nobody's there. Yuiii~.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> If you take down our flag, we have to give you the treasure map-. So I'll tell a lie if I have to.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> But, that's not enough to make me give up!<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Me and Yomi'll take 'em head on, dealing with anybody coming off of Yui's ship.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> I want you protecting our flag, Mihono. If they take it down, they get to take our treasure map.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Then...<br><strong>Akira:</strong> That's what I wanna say, but we're pirates. It'd be lame to just stand guard.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> So, a little after we start up, you sneak on board their ship and take their flag down. Then it's all ours.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> But, what happens if they get on board our ship?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> We can worry about that when it happens, is that right?<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Well, that's how we're winging it. Sounds cooler for you too, right, Mihono?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah! I'll sneak in and take down their flag! Leave it to me!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I thought I'd get in all sneaky and bring your flag down though...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> If that was... your sneaking, being a spy or a ninja really isn't for you, Mihono-chan.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> I kept hearing "Ahh!" and "Crap!"<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> No way~... I thought I was doing perfect though.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> But still, so long as I keep pulling the rope hard--<br><strong>Akira:</strong> That's it! Keep it up just like that, Mihono!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> EIIII---!!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Even though we got Yui's pirate flag, we didn't have any time to look for treasure...!<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Suu's team found the pirate pendants first anyway, so we lost either way.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> With the number of people we had today, we couldn't keep up with two teams at once.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> If we had more people, I bet it would be twice as much fun-!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Next time I want to invite Kanami and Chii-nee along.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> ......<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Though, even though she found the treasure, Inami-san doesn't look happy about it at all.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> From what I heard, it sounds like there was an aradama hiding by the treasure... Apparently it was a really small one though.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> And then Kofuki-san chased after it, leaving Inami-san alone in a dark model cave for a while.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ahh... Fukki... She would run off and leave her, wouldn't she.

Can't exactly... be the only one going back early.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Fufu, thanks for that~.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> What's this attraction like?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> From the sound of it, we're all pirates searching for treasure. You can steal maps from other pirates too... the other people competing to get the treasure, so there's different ways to play.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> You can steal maps from the other players?<br><strong>Suu:</strong> It's sort of a team battle treasure hunt, but all the maps each team gets are different, and some of them are supposed to be fakes.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> I see. It sounds a bit tough. How about let Kofuki know and head over for now.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> U-Um... I'll let you two tell Shichinosato-san about this by yourselves.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Sure thing. Don't worry. I'll break it to Fukki so she'll join us for sure-!<br><strong>Suu:</strong> I-I leave it to you...!<br><strong>Suu:</strong> ...So then, we'll be aiming to clear "Treasures of the Pirates" with the teams we were in fighting aradama before...<br><strong>Suu:</strong> But, what should we do? Juujou-san, Shichinosato-san...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> I don't really have a choice, so I'll do this with you; at least till we get to the X on the map.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Are we fine with not going after the other team's maps?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Mihocchi was all, "Let's plunder-!" but if the map you steal's no good, there's no point.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> ...I think that's fine! It's important to clear the game fast too!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> There is a time limit; they were saying it goes until the cannons fire 3 times.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> It should be just about thirty minutes.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> We might be hard on time if we get in fights.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> There's a drawing like a cave on our treasure map, so we should go there first...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> You can hold onto the map.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> You know I'm just here to make the team's even, right?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Suu's... not the most reliable.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> ......<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Tch... Guess if I've gotta.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Ehh... As long as there aren't any aradama, I'm not like that! ...I won't lose the map, okay!?  </p><h2 id="pirate---hiyori-end-this-might-not-be-so-bad-every-now-and-then-huh" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Pirate - Hiyori: End]: This Might Not Be So Bad Every Now and Then... Huh</h2><p><strong>Suu:</strong> I didn't think the cave drawing on the map would take us to a big stalactite cave facility, and they even had a boat for us. This has to be it--<br><strong>Suu:</strong> --HYAUU!?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Don't shout like that outta nowhere... You made me jump.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> But some water dripped on me! They made this way too real in some weird places...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Anyway, you were just saying you thought this was it; why's that?<br><strong>Suu:</strong> They put a lot of effort into making this place, so I don't think they'd go this far if the right treasure wasn't here.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Putting it pretty straight out there. Though, this does feel like the kinda place that'd have a pirate treasure.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> So that's another way of looking for it. Then, there's a good chance the treasure's up ahead.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> The old pirates' treasured pendants should be here. Finding that is the best way to get points in this game.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Oi... Look! Over there.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Wow... That's a super realistic looking skeleton!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> This must be it. Hey you, go and get the thing.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Roger that-. Inami Suu is setting off-.<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> GYUUU...!<br><strong>Suu:</strong> GYAAH!? Something came out!?<br><strong>Suu:</strong> ...A-A-A-Aradamaaa!?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...What!? After it!<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> ......<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> You're running around all over the place, but this is it!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> It was so small it hardly showed up on the spectrum finder, so it's a good thing we found it.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> There might be others around; let's look.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Should we message Ellen and Kiyoka and them?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Shouldn't have to. The two of us are enough. Well, I could do it myself though.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Maybe you could, but you shouldn't go alone.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...What about Suu?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> There was just one of them, so she'll be fine back there. Let's get this done as fast as we can.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Even if... I don't want to fight aradama... I thought it was really mean the way you left me behind!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> We still came back fast enough.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> I think that place might have been starting to give me a fear of the dark too...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Though from the looks of it, it didn't.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> And anyway, thanks to you, we got the pendant.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Juujou-san, are you... trying really poorly to make me feel better?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...Urgh. I do feel a little bad.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Next time something happens, I'll beat some aradama-chan for you to make up for it.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> And you... You just want to hunt aradama yourself, am I wrong?<br><strong>Suu:</strong> That's right, tell her some more!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Oh! Mihocchi and Kiyoka are headed over. Go shove this pendant in their faces, Hunchback.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Hunchback!? Could you please not call me weird names... It's rude!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Good grief...<br><div><iframe width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ee9V9yy0uqk"></iframe></div>  </p><h2 id="pirate---suu-start-after-eliminating-the-aradama--" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Pirate - Suu: Start]: After Eliminating the Aradama--</h2><p><strong>Aradama:</strong> AAAAA...<br><strong>Suu:</strong> GYAH! D-D-Don't come this way, aradama!<br><strong>Suu:</strong> I mean, Shichinosato-san!? Aradama! There's an aradama!? Hurry up hurry up!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> I've got my own to play with here for now! Either wait it out or do something yourself!<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Come onnn~. You said to leave all the aradama to you; that's why I joined your team~!<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> KSHAAAAAAA...!!<br><strong>Suu:</strong> ...I-It's coming!?<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Uwah!? Uwahh!?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Honestly... What are you even doing? Calm down and hold your okatana properly. Are you trying to get yourself hurt?<br><strong>Suu:</strong> ...G-Got it! Thank you so much, Juujou-san!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> So, we took care of the aradama, but why're we still in the amusement park?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> C'mon, Fukki. You heard Ellen-san, didn't you?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> We're here cause somebody from the park said we could play on their new attraction to test it out!<br><strong>Suu:</strong> We're super lucky they're letting us play on it. "Treasures of the Pirates" is really popular, so it has a reputation for being hard to get onto!<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Dressing up like pirates and going treasure hunting sounds pretty cool.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> It sets a nice mood, doesn't it-. I want to hurry up and play it!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> So anyway, you do it with us, Fukki.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Well actually, I already signed us up as the same teams we had when we were stopping the aradama just now.<br><strong>Kofuki/Suu:</strong> ...Don't go deciding that on your own!/Why did you decide on that for us!?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Eh-!?<br><strong>Suu:</strong> ......<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> ......<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> This "treasure map" the park attendant gave us... Seems like some of them are fakes.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> They are. Which is why, sometimes this turns into a game of fighting over "treasure maps" between the other teams<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> So that's why Ellen and Kiyoka said they'd start searching after they collect all the maps.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> What a waste of time... Let's just go to the point marked on the map we've got, and if that's not it, we're done-.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> ......<br><strong>Suu:</strong> (She really... doesn't seem interested in anything besides aradama. Does Shichinosato-san not have any hobbies or anything?)<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...Nn?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> What, you got a problem with that?<br><strong>Suu:</strong> No-! I think that could work too...!<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Then, let's go as quickly as possible to the place on the map!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Oi... Wait a sec. She didn't even look at the map; where's she think she's going?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...Guess we should go after her.  </p><h2 id="pirate---suu-end-this-was-supposed-to-be-all-fun-and-games" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Pirate - Suu: End]: This Was Supposed to Be All Fun and Games...!</h2><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> So if we find... a pendant from an ancient pirate treasure before time runs out, we win?<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Yes. It looks like you also get points for stealing other team's maps, but getting a pendant is worth the most.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Aghh... Instead of treasure, could we get some aradama-chan in here~.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> No, no, no, no, finding the treasure would be a million times better...! And besides, didn't you beat plenty of aradama today-?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> There were too many of you here, so I got even less to play with-. I'm not even close to satisfied...<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Ehh...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Oi... Look! Over there.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Wow... That's a super realistic looking skeleton!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> This must be it. Hey you, go and get the thing.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Understood-.

Something came out!?<br><strong>Suu:</strong> ...A-A-A-Aradamaaa!?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...What!? After it!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> I know...!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Fufufu...! You're tiny, but you're not getting away!<br><strong>Suu:</strong> ...Ahh! Wait, please wait...! Don't leave me alone in this place-!?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> That's crazy-! So Fukki, you found the treasure and even beat an aradama?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Sure, but it was so freaking small it was over in seconds.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> You could have come right back then... Why did you leave me there for over ten minutes...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> We needed to check around to see if there were any other aradama, just to be sure.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> And you had your okatana with you, didn't you?<br><strong>Suu:</strong> I did... In theory, I get what you're saying. In theory...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Since it was Kofuki-san who said to leave Inami-san behind... she probably wanted to keep the aradama all to herself. She didn't even contact us or anything.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> You really get her, Kiyoka.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> I wanted to beat some aradama-chan, what's wrong with that? Besides, if this scaredycat was in the boat, it'd be more dangerous with her in the way.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Ah, that makes sense...?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Next time we're on a mission together, I'll take care of all your ones for you. Then you won't be whining about it, right?<br><strong>Suu:</strong> In that case... sure.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You can't give in to her, Inami-san.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Ah...!<br><strong>Suu:</strong> (I don't even want to be on missions with her in the first place...
