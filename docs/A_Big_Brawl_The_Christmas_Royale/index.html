They&#x27;re looking excited, aren&#x27;t they?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Well yeah. Exams just finished, and it&#x27;ll be Christmas soon. They&#x27;re all getting into it.<br>
<strong>Nene:</strong> Ne-!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Awww~...<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> What&#x27;s with you? Normally you&#x27;d be all &quot;Christmas!&quot; and dancing around.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Christmas is the problem! Hear me out, Kaoru.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> This year, everyone in my family has some other important business stopping them from getting together on the 25th...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> This was my chance to be with everyone, and I was really looking forward to it.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Aww... Now I&#x27;ll be spending Christmas all by myself.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Fine, since it&#x27;s Christmas, I&#x27;ll celebrate with you. Though it sounds like a lot of effort.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Kaoru...! Friends have to stick together, right! We should start getting things ready for Christmas right now!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> But I&#x27;m tired.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Come on, let&#x27;s go!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> O-Oi, you don&#x27;t have to pull so hard.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> First off, we should think of where to order the cake from.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Ah, for the main course, instead of chicken, why don&#x27;t we do it like in America and roast a turkey?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> The two of us aren&#x27;t gonna be able to finish a whole turkey...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> I just can&#x27;t wait to spend Christmas with you, Kaoru.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> That&#x27;s my phone... I don&#x27;t want to answer.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Is it Sana-sensei? If you don&#x27;t, it&#x27;ll be worse later.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Fine... Hello?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Huhh? Hang on! I only just got back here!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> What&#x27;s wrong? Kaoru?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> I&#x27;ll be on expedition duty Christmas day... Ughh.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> But... What about getting ready for our fun Christmas together!?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> I can help you get ready for a lonely Christmas at least... I can&#x27;t believe how hard they&#x27;re overworking us...<br>
<strong>???:</strong> Ughhhh... Why is this happening to me.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Come on, Kaoru. No matter how bad things are, don&#x27;t you think you&#x27;re laying it on too thick?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> That wasn&#x27;t me just now.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Then, who...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> That one.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Yep, there&#x27;s no mistaking that gloomy face.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Should we talk to her?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Let&#x27;s do it!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Oiii, what&#x27;s wrong? You look upset about something.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Oh, Ellen-san, Kaoru-san.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> I can&#x27;t help but worry when I see you looking depressed, MihoMiho.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Well... You see...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I failed my exams... When I think about how the winter break I&#x27;ve been waiting on is gonna be filled with makeup classes and more exams, I can&#x27;t help but be depressed...<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> That sounds pretty...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> ...Heavy, huh.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> This&#x27;ll be my saddest winter break ever...!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> I know how you feel... We should get to decide how to spend our own break!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Instead of a white Christmas, it&#x27;s looking like we&#x27;ll all be having a black Christmas...<br>
<strong>Passing Toji A:</strong> Isn&#x27;t Christmas coming up? Do you have any plans?<br>
<strong>Passing Toji B:</strong> Ahaha, of course I don&#x27;t.<br>
<strong>Passing Toji A:</strong> Then, have you heard about that Five Traditions Unified Christmas Mock Battle they&#x27;re doing on Christmas Eve?<br>
<strong>Passing Toji A:</strong> The one where the winner gets a reward from the head of the family.<br>
<strong>Passing Toji B:</strong> Nobody told me. What reward?<br>
<strong>Passing Toji A:</strong> They&#x27;re saying you can wish for anything, and the head of the family will make it happen.<br>
<strong>Passing Toji B:</strong> Seriously!? That&#x27;s Yukari-sama for you, I guess. I&#x27;ll think about it.<br>
<strong>Mihono &amp; Ellen:</strong> ...!?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> I&#x27;m going to ask for more information! You two just wait right here-!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> If what they were saying is true... Then there&#x27;s still hope!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Well, nobody wants to spend Christmas studying.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="2-unified-christmas-mock-battle"></a>2: Unified Christmas Mock Battle<a class="hash-link" href="#2-unified-christmas-mock-battle" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Ellen:</strong> Getting right to it, both the Five Traditions Unified Christmas Mock Battle and Yukari-sama granting any wish are real!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> That&#x27;s crazy!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> It&#x27;s just limited to anything Yukari-sama can make happen.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> But that means Yukari-sama could cancel out my failing grades and makeup classes, right!?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> That&#x27;s what it means. Yukari-sama&#x27;s so generous.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Then I might be able to win back my fun filled winter break... Probably!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> That&#x27;s the spirit, MihoMiho!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I should tell Chii-nee and the others about the mock battle!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> I think they&#x27;re going to officially announce it soon.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Oh, okay. So what are we supposed to do to win, anyway?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> They said they&#x27;re going to announce that on the day of the mock battle.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> If they&#x27;re granting any wish, there&#x27;s going to be a lot of people getting worked up over it.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> That&#x27;s right, that&#x27;s why I need you getting worked up over it too, Kaoru!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Sure.<br>
<strong>Nene:</strong> Nene-!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> We might both end up rivals in the mock battle, but let&#x27;s both do our best to get that Christmas present, MihoMiho!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I&#x27;m not planning on losing!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Chew chew... Your cookies are always good. I like them.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I&#x27;ll make more for you. Oh right, why don&#x27;t we hold a Christmas party together? I can make you more than just cookies.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm... I&#x27;ll look forward to spending Christmas together.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> But... I can&#x27;t help you get ready for the party.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> You didn&#x27;t have to worry about that, but why?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> The day before Christmas, there&#x27;s going to be a unified mock battle. President Takatsu told me to win it.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I have friends who are joining that too. The winner is supposed to get their wish granted by Yukari-sama.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I know you&#x27;re strong, Sayaka-chan, but don&#x27;t push yourself too hard.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm. If I got hurt, I wouldn&#x27;t be able to spend Christmas with you. I&#x27;ll be careful.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Okay, please do. So then, do you know what you want to wish for?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> The president only told me to fight. It&#x27;s like a mission.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Hmm... You should think up something, in case you win.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Something you want, or want to try doing.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> I&#x27;ll think about it. Thank you, Mai.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> You don&#x27;t have to thank me. But if there&#x27;s anything you want from me, just ask, okay?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> I want another cookie.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> In that case... Here, say &quot;ahhh&quot;.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> This Five Traditions Unified Mock Battle we&#x27;re holding... It could be a good chance for toji to improve their technique and sense of awareness.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> But, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;ll be a winner.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I agree. Considering the victory condition, it&#x27;s very difficult.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> We&#x27;ll have to do everything we can to make sure this mock battle goes off without a hitch.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes.<br>
And now, the 24th of December. The day of the Five Traditions Unified Christmas Mock Battle has arrived.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="3-an-out-of-place-christmas-tree"></a>3: An Out of Place Christmas Tree<a class="hash-link" href="#3-an-out-of-place-christmas-tree" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Maki:</strong> Silence-! Yukari-sama is about to explain the purpose of today&#x27;s mock battle. Please, go ahead.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> To begin with, I want to apologize for making this announcement so shortly before the event begins.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> To all of you students, tomorrow you will be entering your winter break, sure to be a time of festivities as we enter the new year.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> However, for all of you toji, I would like for you to once more engrave your duty deeper into your minds. To that end, I have hosted this Five Traditions Unified Christmas Mock Battle.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Though, I don&#x27;t mean to be so strict with you today. I promise that, whoever can come out the victor of this mock battle, I will grant any wish I can make possible.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Basically, that makes Yukari-sama your Santa Claus this year~!<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> ...Indeed, though my clothes aren&#x27;t nearly as red, and I have hardly as many presents to reward you with.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> That will be all from me. There are those among you who won&#x27;t participate in this assignment, but I hope you feel mutually encouraged by those aiming for victory.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Now then, I&#x27;ll be going over the rules and victory condition.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> First, to explain how we will decide the victor, I&#x27;d like for you all to look at the top of this tree.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Do you see the star mounted on top? Whoever can take that star will be our winner.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> So there was a practical reason for that big tree.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> I just thought it was there to look pretty.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> You can defeat your rival toji first, or aim right for that shining star.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> But, those rivals won&#x27;t be your only obstacle. Protecting that star will be--<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Hiii, it&#x27;s me and Suzuka onee-san!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yume, Maki-san was in the middle of her explanation.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ehhh, but she was just gonna introduce us, so what&#x27;s the difference?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Sigh... Maki-san, please continue.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Putting it simply... If you can&#x27;t pass the defenses of the second and fourth seat of the elite guard, you won&#x27;t be getting that star.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> And as far as time goes, you have until 10pm to accomplish that. That does it, as far as basic rules go.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> In addition, I will go over responding to any aradama that appear during the mock battle.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> In the case of an aradama&#x27;s appearance, dealing with it will be our top priority. Of course, taking the star at that point will not count.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Please do not forget your duty as toji.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Then, Suzuka, Yume.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Starting now, the Five Traditions Unified Christmas Mock Battle will begin-!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> All of you can come at once, you don&#x27;t have to be shy you know-?<br>
<strong>Ordinary Toji A:</strong> They might be the elite guard, but there&#x27;s only two of them... If we all rush them, someone will be able to break through for sure!<br>
<strong>Ordinary Toji B:</strong> We don&#x27;t have to beat them either... So long as one of us can grab that star--<br>
<strong>Ordinary Toji C:</strong> Let&#x27;s all go together-!!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Too easy. I can&#x27;t even call that a warmup~. If that&#x27;s all you&#x27;ve got, you&#x27;re just gonna annoy me making me fight you.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> You shouldn&#x27;t speak to them like that. This is an exercise in improving their technique. You need to face them as proper opponents<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Fineee. You can take a break, you know, Suzuka onee-san.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Fufu, I&#x27;m afraid I can&#x27;t accept that offer, but I&#x27;d welcome seeing you try your best, Yume.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Nobody said I was gonna have to fight the elite guard for this!?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Considering the reward, I expected as much...<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> I&#x27;ve confirmed the victory condition... I&#x27;ll secure the star now.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Hang on, Sayaka-chan. Why don&#x27;t we wait and see how things play out first?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Understood. I know I can rely on you at times like this, Mai.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Hmmm~, looks like we&#x27;re really going to have to work to make this happen. But, so long as you&#x27;re here Kaoru, I know we can do it!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> I&#x27;m really losing interest in this whole wish granting thing though. It suddenly became a pain in the ass... Ahh, I could be eating kanpyo rolls under a kotatsu right about now.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Just forget about everything else, and let&#x27;s challenge ourselves a little!<br>
<strong>Nene:</strong> Ne-ne! Ne-ne!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Alright, you win, but just a little.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Now then. How do we go about getting past Yumecchi and HanaHana...  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="4-the-distant-star"></a>4: The Distant Star<a class="hash-link" href="#4-the-distant-star" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Mock Battle Participant A:</strong> Kyaa...!?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> You&#x27;re all being far too careless.<br>
<strong>Mock Battle Participant B:</strong> Wait... When did she-!?<br>
<strong>Mock Battle Participant C:</strong> How are they this strong...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> No matter how many you bring, you won&#x27;t reach the tree without a proper plan.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Aww, I thought I was gonna get to play with those onee-sans!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> You were dealing with another group, weren&#x27;t you, Yume?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I wanted to count how many I could play with at the same time.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Why exactly do you think we&#x27;re here...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> The elite guard might be a huge wall in the way, but I&#x27;m not about to give up on Christmas and winter break... Mmmm, what do I do...?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> It&#x27;s true... Those two are unbelievably strong. But you don&#x27;t have to defeat them. You only have to worry about getting the star from the tree.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Oh yeah! If I don&#x27;t have to beat them... Then getting out of makeup classes isn&#x27;t just a dream!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> That&#x27;s right... With the right strategy, you might still win. Though, I&#x27;d be okay with helping you study for your exams, you know?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> If I can help it... I don&#x27;t want to study!!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Honestly, as your onee-san, I&#x27;d rather you studied instead. But I promised I&#x27;d help you with this.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> We&#x27;ll just have to put our heads together and figure out how to get that star. &quot;Where there&#x27;s a will, there&#x27;s a way&quot;, right?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah! Where there&#x27;s a will, there&#x27;s a way...!!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> That&#x27;s my Mihono-chan.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> So you two were doing all that yelling. A will and a way&#x27;s not gonna help you beat the elite guard.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I know, but... Then you help too, Fukki!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Don&#x27;t wanna. Call me when there&#x27;s aradama-chan to fight instead of toji.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> But I think if you helped us, our chances of winning would be much higher, Kofuki-chan.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> I&#x27;m on standby. You guys can handle that mock battle yourselves.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Besides, Chichie, you baby Mihocchi way too much. I mean come on, her wish is getting out of makeup classes...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Ughh!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> You might be right, Kofuki-chan.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Chii-nee.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> But even so, if Mihono-chan is in trouble, I want to be there to help her. I&#x27;m her onee-san, after all.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Chii-nee!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> O-Oh... Mihono-chan... When you hug me like that... It&#x27;s a little awkward.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Ehehe. I made up my mind, there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m not getting that star!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Fighting those two directly will be tough, but I&#x27;ll try to give you an opening.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...Whatever, I won&#x27;t be a third wheel. Ahh, when are there gonna be some aradama-chan around here.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> The star feels so so high up and far away.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> I thought that Yume was obsessed with fighting, but even after teasing her she won&#x27;t move away...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> And even if you did, HanaHana&#x27;s still there.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> But still, we can&#x27;t just keep hiding back here. Let&#x27;s go get a close up look at the enemy!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> I&#x27;ll give it a shot.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ahaha! You came out of nowhere, right from my blind spot! That&#x27;s more like it!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> You&#x27;re going to hurt my feelings, acting so casual about my surprise attack~<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> D&#x27;yaaah!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> At last, some opponents worth fighting have arrived.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Though, doesn&#x27;t that okatana give you trouble in close quarters?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Well, that much is obvious. But it doesn&#x27;t matter.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I see, so you&#x27;re betting on her to win then?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Yes, I&#x27;m here to take your star!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Nooope, I won&#x27;t let you do that, Onee-san-!!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Haaaah-! I&#x27;ll send you flying-!!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Oh...! Combining that move with hachimanriki! Nice, Yumecchi!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Fufu~, seeya next time, Onee-san~!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Alright, time to retreat.<br>
<strong>Nene:</strong> Nene!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...Huh!?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> She launched you pretty far. You okay?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> I&#x27;m fine, thank you. I like when you get worried, Kaoru.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> So, what do you think?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> They made some changes to the way they fought against us.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Yumecchi&#x27;s speed is an issue, but it seems like they&#x27;re fighting to keep us away from the tree.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> If they can&#x27;t beat someone in one hit and a long fight breaks out, it must get a lot harder protecting the star.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> So it probably makes their job easiest if they keep using hachimanriki to bounce us away.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Feels like Yumecchi is on top of her game today. This could be a real piece of work.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Geez-! Why&#x27;d they run after I only knocked her away one time-! That&#x27;s so boring!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="5-various-desires"></a>5: Various Desires<a class="hash-link" href="#5-various-desires" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Yume:</strong> Sayaka-chan, play~ with~ me~!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Sorry, I&#x27;ll be your opponent instead!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Nn~, then I&#x27;ll leave Sayaka-chan for later. How long do you think you can keep up with me, Onee-san?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> If you&#x27;re challenging me too, then I&#x27;ll face you the same as the others.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Fighting you isn&#x27;t my goal. So...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Well, of course it wouldn&#x27;t be. But--<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> In the middle of our fighting, I tried to lead Tsubakuro-san away from the tree. But it was no use.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Tsubakuro Yume moved a little away. It wasn&#x27;t a bad plan, Mai.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I think Konohana-san... No, Tsubakuro-san too, they realized what we were doing. If I were on the defending team, it would never be a good idea to move far from the tree.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Maybe we should have tried a more direct offense before.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> We won&#x27;t be able to take the star that easily.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> That reminds me, Sayaka-chan. Have you decided what you&#x27;ll wish for when you get the star yet?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> I forgot to think about it. My wish... What I want to do, what I want.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> That&#x27;s right. Yukari-sama seems like she would be able to make anything possible.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...I thought of it... I want to eat Mai&#x27;s cookies.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> But Yukari-sama could ask a high class bakery to make you some delicious sweets. Why not ask for that?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> No, I want yours. When I think about getting to eat the tasty cookies Mai made, I feel like I can work even harder.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> In that case, I&#x27;ll bake you the most delicious cookies I&#x27;ve ever made, I promise.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm, I want to try that.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> But, to get that star, we can&#x27;t just fight those two.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> That&#x27;s right. Why don&#x27;t we look for an opportunity as we see how they move to intercept? We&#x27;re sure to find an opening somewhere.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Hm?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> What is it? Mai?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Tsubakuro-san, she left the tree? What are they planning... A trap?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Come onnn, nobody strong is showing up! This is too boring! Ever since the start, we&#x27;ve only been getting weaklings!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> You knew this would happen, though. There are few toji capable of entertaining you out there.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Well there was Sayaka-chan and some others, but they won&#x27;t fight me for real.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> They seem to be coming up with their own plans.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I got it! Since I&#x27;m bored, I&#x27;ll see if Maki onee-san will play with me!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I supposed this might happen. I&#x27;ll handle things while you&#x27;re gone.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Hey, hey, fight me, Maki onee-san! I was about to die of boredom over there~.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> You know we can&#x27;t do that now. You and I both have our duties here.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Boo. You just have to stay near Yukari-sama!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ah! I just thought of something good. Yukari-sama~? If I can protect the star, I want you to grant my wish!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> That&#x27;s already an important role Yukari-sama gave you. Don&#x27;t start acting greedy with it.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> No, if that will keep Yume motivated, I&#x27;ll allow it. If you can keep the star untouched, I&#x27;ll grant your wish.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> You mean it!? Hooray-! I wonder what I should wish for~?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Wasn&#x27;t that nice of her, Tsubakuro-san.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Yeah! It&#x27;s my Christmas present~, my Christmas present~!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> (Come to think of it, doesn&#x27;t something happen around Christmas?)<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> ...Ah! It&#x27;s Yomi onee-san&#x27;s...!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> (Yomi onee-san&#x27;s birthday! I remember hearing it&#x27;s on Christmas Eve!)<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> My... What?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> It&#x27;s nothing, nothing at all-!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> (I&#x27;ll make Yomi onee-san all surprised by giving her a birthday present out of nowhere~!)<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> (What should I get for her~. What would make Yomi onee-san happy...)<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> !!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Hey, hey, Yomi onee-san, you love rice, right? You were eating a lot of rice balls the other day.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ...Yes. Though, why are you asking?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> No reason, I just remembered is all.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I should get back to the tree now! Nobody&#x27;s gonna get that star from me, just you watch~.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Yume is looking especially motivated now.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> You made the right call, Yukari-sama.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes. Now it will be harder than ever for those participating to take that star.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> We can&#x27;t say for sure how things will end. Let&#x27;s watch as the toji show us how they&#x27;ve grown.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> No matter how many times you try, it&#x27;s gonna be the same, you know~? I won&#x27;t go easy on you.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> You seem to be rather excited about your work now. Did something happen?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Yukari-sama promised me, if I can keep the star from getting taken, she&#x27;ll grant my wish too~!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Then I&#x27;ll need to do my best to make sure your wish comes true, Yume.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Thanks, Suzuka onee-san!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="6-christmas-memories"></a>6: Christmas Memories<a class="hash-link" href="#6-christmas-memories" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Chie:</strong> Now&#x27;s your chance, Mihono-chan!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Okay!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Are you thinking you can take me cause Suzuka onee-san&#x27;s busy with other people? That&#x27;s a little disappointing.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> I&#x27;m not taking you lightly. But you can&#x27;t win without risking it!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> No matter who you are, I won&#x27;t be allowing you through.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...So fast! Even though she already had her hands full.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> I won&#x27;t let you stop her-!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> You can&#x27;t go getting distracted like that, Onee-san.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Eh?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Chii-nee!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Phew... I made it!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ooh, that was a pretty good move! I wasn&#x27;t expecting you to step in~.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Chii-nee... Let&#x27;s get out of here for now!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Ah...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I grabbed your hand pretty hard back there. Was I too rough?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> ...You didn&#x27;t hurt me at all.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> You know, I&#x27;m sorry I dragged you into this on Christmas Eve, Chii-nee...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Tsubakuro-san and Konohana-san were on us in a second. It put me in a cold sweat...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> No, thank you for saving me. I&#x27;m supposed to be your onee-san... But I&#x27;m no help.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> What are you saying, Chii-nee? You&#x27;re always helping me out.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Thank you. Maybe it&#x27;s because of how you took my hand then, but you reminded me of when we were kids.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Did something like this happen before?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> I was about to start crying, and... You came straight over and led me away by the hand. It was just like this; you were a real hero of justice.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I was? I think I remember something like that, but...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> But still, lately you really feel like an onee-san, Chii-nee. You&#x27;re nothing like you used to be. And you help me out all the time.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> It makes me happy to hear you say that, Mihono-chan. I mean it.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> You know, now that we&#x27;re thinking back, remember that time when you were in elementary school and we had a Christmas party at your house?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> I do. And I remember you were so excited that you dropped your cake on the floor. You got so upset over it.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> W-Well I was just a kid back then...!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> But then, you cut your cake in half and gave me some.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> I think I was trying to act a little more like your onee-san.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> You keep running into trouble, Mihono-chan, so I want to be there more for you to rely on me.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Besides, Christmas cake doesn&#x27;t taste as good when you&#x27;re eating it by yourself, right?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah! It was only half, but I remember it being really yummy.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Look at us, getting lost in the past. Why don&#x27;t we come back to the present and think about how we&#x27;re going to get that star down?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> I want to spend another good Christmas with you this year, after all.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> For sure! I&#x27;m counting on you, Chii-nee!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> You can help think too, Mihono-chan.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Because the members of the elite guard protecting the tree are stronger than expected, there are less and less toji trying for the star. Meanwhile, it&#x27;s becoming easier for them to guard it.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> In short, I think many people have given up already.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Maybe that&#x27;s why. Konohana-san worked through the people she was already fighting quicker than I thought, so...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> But, I also think it&#x27;s a good thing there are less rivals now.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> I see you still haven&#x27;t given up, MihoMiho. If only Kaoru could learn from that side of you.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Does that mean Kaoru-san quit already?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Unfortunately, yes. It sounds like she&#x27;s too tired from being on so many expeditions.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> She must have been on a lot...<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Oh, you&#x27;re here, Ellen-chan.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> I was waiting for you, MaiMai, Saaya.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Ellen, what did you want to talk about?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Huh? What&#x27;s going on?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Fufufu~  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="7-until-you-get-the-toji-star"></a>7: Until You Get the Toji Star!<a class="hash-link" href="#7-until-you-get-the-toji-star" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Ellen:</strong> We&#x27;re holding a combined strategy meeting to settle this once and for all!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ooh!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> To start with, why don&#x27;t we all share what happened the times we tried getting that star?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> When Kaoru and I made our move, I was going to use jin&#x27;i and hachimanriki to reach the top, but Yumecchi saw it coming.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Kaoru was keeping HanaHana busy at the time. How did things go for you when you went up against those two?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> You can be sure that if you take your attention off them for a moment, they&#x27;ll be closing in.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> If Mihono-chan wasn&#x27;t there to protect me... I&#x27;m sure Tsubakuro-san would have taken me out.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> How about you, MaiMai?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Konohana-san keeps a close eye on Tsubakuro-san, and is always ready to follow up and coordinate with her.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> It&#x27;s hard to take the star while being Tsubakuro Yume&#x27;s opponent. You don&#x27;t get to focus on anything else.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> You&#x27;re right about that. It feels like to push through their defense, I&#x27;d need another helping hand or two.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> The time limit is also approaching.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Then it sounds like we need to have everyone here fighting together?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> That&#x27;s a nice idea, but everyone here wants the star for themselves, right?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Oh yeah.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> That&#x27;s going to make everyone joining forces sort of difficult.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> That&#x27;s true. I don&#x27;t have a wish of my own, but I promised Mihono-chan I would help her with hers.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I&#x27;m sort of the same way.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> If we try our hardest, I&#x27;m sure things will turn out for the best for one of us.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Let&#x27;s all work hard and not worry about who&#x27;s going to win!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Fufu~. It&#x27;s looking like I&#x27;ll be the one getting the star after all.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> You shouldn&#x27;t have said that, Yume. Now they&#x27;re here.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Hyaah-!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I&#x27;ll play with both of you at once!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> I&#x27;m going to take the star.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> While they attack from the front, we&#x27;ll move in from the other side.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> You didn&#x27;t think it would be that easy, did you?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Mihono-chan, I&#x27;ve got this... And Tsubakuro-san is also...!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Thanks, Chii-nee!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I&#x27;m more than capable of handling the two of you as well.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> (Everyone&#x27;s started making their moves.)<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> (Even though we said we wouldn&#x27;t work together, attacking in waves would be the most effective option.)<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> (Hmm, Yumecchi should be better for this than HanaHana.)<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> If only Kaoru were here, I could calm down and enjoy myself some more.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Yumecchi! Don&#x27;t you want to play with me?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Hmph... I&#x27;m a little busy playing with Sayaka-chan and this other onee-san right now, so come back later!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> But that&#x27;s no good; I want to play with you now.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I told you, go away!!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Sayaka-chan!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> !<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Don&#x27;t go anywhere, Sayaka-chan! I&#x27;ll deal with this onee-san later... Haaah-!!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> (She&#x27;s grinning? To begin with, why would she come to take Yume&#x27;s attack head on like that?)<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> (That&#x27;s right... When she fought her last time, Yume used hachimanriki like this to knock her... Ah!)<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> You can&#x27;t do that... Yume! If you hit her away--<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Huh?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Just like I wanted, thanks a bunch!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> If I bounce up the tree with some help from hachimanriki, the star&#x27;s right in my reach.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Kohagura Ellen&#x27;s got the star in her hands!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> She actually used the kickback from being struck by Tsubakuro-san...<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Ellen&#x27;s amazing.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Awww... I don&#x27;t believe it.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> That&#x27;s not fair, big boobie onee-san!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Ooph! It&#x27;s perfectly fair. I put all my faith in how strong you are, Yumeechi!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> The winner is Kohagura Ellen. With this, the Five Traditions Unified Christmas Mock Battle comes to a close.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="8-ellens-wish"></a>8: Ellen&#x27;s Wish<a class="hash-link" href="#8-ellens-wish" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Mai:</strong> That&#x27;s too bad, huh.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Ellen&#x27;s tactics won. I wanted those cookies, but I had fun fighting with you, Mai.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Fufu, don&#x27;t worry. I&#x27;ll still make you cookies and a cake for Christmas.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I know it isn&#x27;t much compared to Yukari-sama granting you anything. But it&#x27;s my Christmas present to you for trying so hard, Sayaka-chan.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> I&#x27;m excited for tomorrow.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Boo. We almost made it...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> She did find a clever way to win, but it&#x27;s frustrating nonetheless.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I think you two fought well.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> But I wanted to ask Yukari-sama to give Yomi onee-san a year&#x27;s worth of Akita rice for her birthday present-!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ...Yume.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> So that&#x27;s what you were thinking about.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I just wanted to give her a present.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> It would be difficult to accept a year&#x27;s worth, but thank you, Tsubakuro-san.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> You don&#x27;t have to thank me, I couldn&#x27;t even get you anything.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> That&#x27;s not true... I&#x27;ll make you some kiritanpo to eat, Tsubakuro-san.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Kiritanpo on Christmas? Ahaha, that&#x27;s really weird-!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> If there&#x27;s a kind of rice you like, please tell me. If not, I will choose a rice from Akita.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Yo, winner.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Where have you been all this time?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> So, what are you gonna wish for?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> For Yukari-sama to give you a vacation on Christmas. That&#x27;s all I want!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> You can think of it as my Christmas present to you.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Huhh? You&#x27;re the one who won. Use it for yourself.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> You could have just accepted it. But I love when you&#x27;re considerate like that, Kaoru.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> I&#x27;m just stating the obvious. Come on, isn&#x27;t there anything else you want?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Hmmm... Let&#x27;s see. I only want to spend a nice Christmas together with you, so...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> ! I just had a good idea!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> I&#x27;ll ask for a Five Traditions Unified Christmas Party. That way, everyone can have a good time together!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Why not, it sounds like fun.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Is that okay, Yukari-sama?<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> A Unified Christmas Party? It&#x27;s short notice, but that won&#x27;t be a problem. I&#x27;ll begin the preparations.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> The elite guard will take charge of responding to any aradama incidents that may happen tomorrow.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> No matter what aradama show up, you know I&#x27;m enough to beat them alone, Yukari-sama.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> We&#x27;ll do as you order, Yukari-sama. The elite guard doesn&#x27;t object.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> With that settled, tomorrow we will host the Five Traditions Unified Christmas Party.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Kaoru gets the day off, and we get to spend Christmas together. It&#x27;s two birds with one stone!<br>
<strong>Nene:</strong> Ne-!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Normally in America we spend it with our families, but I heard in Japan you spend it with the person you love, so this year I&#x27;ll try a Japanese style Christmas!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Because you&#x27;re the person I love, Kaoru!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Uh, when they say that, it&#x27;s actually supposed to be more like a romantic thing... ...Well, fine. I get the day off, so I&#x27;ll go along with it.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> It sounds like Yukari-sama is hosting a Christmas party instead.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> If Mai&#x27;s going, I&#x27;ll go too.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> There&#x27;s going to be a big Christmas party, Mihono-chan. So cheer up.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> The party sounds like fun, but... Makeup classes won&#x27;t be.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> I can&#x27;t go to class for you, but I&#x27;ll be right there helping you get ready for your exams.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> That way, you should still be able to find some time to have fun over the break, right?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> So let&#x27;s forget about that for now and enjoy tomorrow&#x27;s party, okay?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> WAAAAHH! I&#x27;m so lucky I have you, Chii-nee... No, you&#x27;re all I have left, Chii-neeee!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Oh... You&#x27;re exaggerating, Mihono-chan. There, there.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Looks like you made the right call with the party.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Fufu, I&#x27;m glad you think so. Still, those two sure are close, aren&#x27;t they.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations/edit/docs/A_Big_Brawl_The_Christmas_Royale.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_2_ui" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_3DPF"></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"></div></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_35-E thin-scrollbar"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#1-a-black-christmas" class="table-of-contents__link">1: A Black Christmas?</a></li><li><a href="#2-unified-christmas-mock-battle" class="table-of-contents__link">2: Unified Christmas Mock Battle</a></li><li><a href="#3-an-out-of-place-christmas-tree" class="table-of-contents__link">3: An Out of Place Christmas Tree</a></li><li><a href="#4-the-distant-star" class="table-of-contents__link">4: The Distant Star</a></li><li><a href="#5-various-desires" class="table-of-contents__link">5: Various Desires</a></li><li><a href="#6-christmas-memories" class="table-of-contents__link">6: Christmas Memories</a></li><li><a href="#7-until-you-get-the-toji-star" class="table-of-contents__link">7: Until You Get the Toji Star!</a></li><li><a href="#8-ellens-wish" class="table-of-contents__link">8: Ellen&#39;s Wish</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Links</div><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://pastebin.com/LdyviZ8Z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Translator anon&#x27;s pastebin<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Site source code<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Built with Docusaurus.</div></div></div></footer></div>
