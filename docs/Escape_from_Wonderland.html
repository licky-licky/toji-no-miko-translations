I've got expedition duty tomorrow... I'm sleeping in until the sun sets today...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Just wake up already!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> ......Where are we?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Good morning, Kaoru! Now everyone's awake!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...Ahh, figures you were behind this. You know, Ellen, if you're kidnapping someone, the prank's gone too far.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> What led you to that conclusion!?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I'm not the one who did this! When I woke up, I was just in this room too!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...Wait, what. Why'd something this annoying have to go and happen.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Did the rest of you wake up in here too?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah... I remember eating with Kiyoka and Fukki, and then...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I felt sleepy all of a sudden... When I woke up, I was here.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Yeah. Don't remember anything else.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Something similar happened to me. What about you, Konohana Suzuka and Tsubakuro Yume?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Uhh...? Suzuka-onee-san, do you remember anything?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Not a single thing. We all seem to have been in different circumstances, but the common factor is that none of us remember how we got here.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Somebody's going around kidnapping toji? I bet our presid-- our old hag finally made someone snap.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> You're taking this situation in stride. Do you have experience in being kidnapped?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Who would...? What I'm thinking is, there's two of the elite guard here.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> So they must be searching for us like crazy right about now.<br><strong>???:</strong> Oh no! Oh no! At this rate, Wonderland will be gone for good!<br><strong>???:</strong> ...But, wait? Why was it going away again?<br><strong>???:</strong> Oh no! Oh no!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> That voice, that's Chii-nee!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Chie's here... Forget searching for us, I guess we're already safe. Does that mean we can just go back to sleep now?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> We have our duties as the elite guard to consider, so I'd like to make my way out.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> And besides... Given the situation, it might be amusing to play along.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> We want to get out of here fast too. We were about to go see a movie!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Then, we're going to have to figure out how to leave this place!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> The only way out of the room is through this locked door. There has to be a key around here somewhere.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I don't see any key, however... There is a photograph on the table.<br><strong>[Q0]:</strong> (There is a photo of Kaoru, Mihono, Kiyoka, Kofuki, Yume, Ellen, Mirja, and Suzuka...)<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> On the backside there is the letter "Q"... Does it mean "Question"?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Are they saying we have to answer the question if we want to leave the room?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Oh! It's an escape room game!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> The answer's easy peasy! It's eight people!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ehhh, why was that wrong? Wasn't the question how many people were in the picture?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yume, we mustn't jump to conclusions. You should think a little longer about the question before answering next time.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Hmmm... They're really making this difficult, not writing out the question.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> This is only my assumption, but it's likely the answer would be too easily discovered if the full question were written out.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Which means the answer's easy. This'll be fun; let's see Mihocchi give it a shot.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Me!? Umm, umm... I-Is it one of those ones where you spot the differences?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Like we compare the picture to how things are in the room now, and see if anything's different... Or something.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Oh, that's a way better idea than I was expecting. So, what's different?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Hmm, it all looks the same to me...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> These things usually have more than one difference, and they just keep getting harder, right?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> So I think there should be one or two easy ones... Is the answer that the desk is bigger?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> That seems to have been wrong?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> That's weird... They gave us a photo, so I was sure they were asking what was different...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Maybe that's a trap?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> If Chichie made this, then we've gotta see through her tricks.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> This is exciting; it feels like we're getting closer to figuring it out!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> See through... What if it's that we're all awake, or that there's no photo on the table?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> There's two answers that sound good enough, Mihocchi.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Going by my intuition... The answer is, we're not asleep now!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> KYAA!?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Why'd the lights go out... Hey!? Mirja's not here anymore!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Huh...? This is, Mirja's glasses, and a watch...?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Don't tell me... Because we got it wrong, Mirja-san got turned into glasses!?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Sigh... Don't be ridiculous. It seems that, after a certain number of mistakes, one of us is eliminated.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> In that case, the time left on here is our time limit? 100 minutes... Feels like we could use it all on this question.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Don't worry. If this is an escape room game, there's sure to be some kind of hint in the room.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Did anyone see a hint anywhere?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> No, I don't think there's any...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Really?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Come up with something more than "Really"!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> There's aradama!?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Least they brought something to keep us from getting bored in here! I'll take care of all of them!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> No fair, Onee-san! Let me have some too-!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> A playing card fell out of it... Oh? Something's written on it.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> There it is!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Seems like the aradama must have taken our hint.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> The spectrum finder is still getting a reading... This won't be settled so easily.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Let's gather all the hints we can.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Aha, this is more fun than regular aradama fighting~.<br><strong>Hint 1:</strong> "Don't let them get in the way of our rampage!"<br><strong>Hint 2:</strong> "If only they weren't around!"<br><strong>Hint 3:</strong> "Our natural enemy!"  </p><h2 id="2-the-eight-white-rabbits-room" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>2: The Eight White Rabbits Room</h2><p><strong>Ellen:</strong> I get it now. The answer is... "Toji"!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ah, a key fell down!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Now we can move on to the next room! Let's go see what the next question is!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> This room... It looks just like the last one, doesn't it? Maybe there's another photo lying around?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I don't think they would use the same question twice in a row...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Onee-sans, there's two letters on top of the table.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> The first one has the question, and the second... What is this?<br><strong>Letter from the White Rabbit:</strong> Help us, Miss Toji! Defeat the aradama, and protect Wonderland!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Aradama have appeared in Wonderland, and they've brought toji in to help... I suppose that's the story here.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> What does the question say?<br><strong>[Q1]:</strong> Two Dumptys, Five Tweedle Dums and Tweedle Dees, and six Humptys chased the eight White Rabbits.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> "Two Dumptys, Five Tweedle Dums and Tweedle Dees, and six Humptys chased the eight White Rabbits"...?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Why are Humpty and Dumpty written separately...?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Did you figure something out, Suzuka-onee-san?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> No... It's only that, Humpty Dumpty is one character.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Humpty and Dumpty shouldn't be treated as two separate things...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> And there's way too many people too!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> There weren't eight white rabbits, or anywhere near that many Tweedle Dees and Dums!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Without the question written out, I'm at a loss... I don't know what kind of answer they want.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...There aren't any hints in this room either, are there.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Does that mean there's gonna be more aradama-chan coming in here? This is the best!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Alright, Mihocchi! I'll get the clues for you, so you're in charge of solving the question!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Eh-!? You have to solve it with me, Fukki-!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> We've gotta split up the work. Since you didn't help at all with the last question, you've gotta try extra hard with this one.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I-I'll try!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Uhh... There's eight white rabbits, right? So, maybe the Humpty Dumpties made... body... doubles?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> What, like Humpty Dumpty's a ninja? You want to go with that answer?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Y-Yeah. Ah, we can make up to two mistakes, right?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> We knew that was wrong before she even said it! Why didn't you stop her, Suzuka-onee-san?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> There's hardly a reason to get angry over one or two mistakes. So long as the final answer is correct.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> You should think up with an answer with us, Yume.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I'm helping with beating the aradama, so you can answer the quiz questions, Suzuka-onee-san!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Don't be like that, Yumecchi. I bet it'll be a lot of fun to figure it out for yourself!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Then at least give me a hint. It's too hard; I don't really get it.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Hmm, this is a tough one. We need something to set us on the right path.<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> GUOOOOOOO!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Yumecchi, there's aradama!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Did they come to give us a hint!? HAAAAAAA!!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Ah, wait up, Yume... Hey, there's none of them left for me!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> That's your fault for being a slowpoke, Onee-san.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Huhh!? Who're you calling a slowpoke!?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> And the hint... I see, so that's what they want.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Oh, this tells us how to answer it! With this, we just have to...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Kiyokaaa... Even with the hint, I don't get ittt...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> You need to focus more on your studies, Asakura-san.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Uuu...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Hang in there, Mihomiho!<br><strong>Hint 1:</strong> There is a hidden word.<br><strong>Hint 2:</strong> whiterabbit<br><strong>Hint 3:</strong> dumpty<br><strong>Hint 4:</strong> tweedledum<br><strong>Hint 5:</strong> tweedledee<br><strong>Hint 6:</strong> humptY  </p><h2 id="3-the-treasure-room" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>3: The Treasure Room</h2><p><strong>Ellen:</strong> The answer is "Buddy"!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> [White rabbit] is "White Rabbit"! And there were eight of them, so we pick out the eighth letter: "b"!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> If we keep picking out letters of the alphabet like that, then line them up in order, we get... Buddy!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> ......<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> What is it, Yume? You're pouting like something's the matter.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I thought this was boring, but I'm sorta frustrated that I couldn't figure it out...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I'll be the one to answer the next question, okay!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> In this room too, they left two letters for us. Let's see...<br><strong>Letter from the White Rabbit:</strong> Ahh!? My treasures were scattered all about!!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Treasures...? Is the question this time about finding treasures?<br><strong>[Q2]:</strong> MITSU TSUGU tsu ha SUI YASU no JIN ZEN GIRI ru no ya ECHI KANE ki<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Umm, "mitsu tsugu tsu"...?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Let me have it, Onee-san! ...The heck is this!?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I want to see too, Tsubakuro-san! ...Whoa, my head hurts.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> There's supposed to be treasures hidden in here, right? Treasures... Treasures...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> There aren't any treasures anywhere!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Hang on, Tsubakuro-san! At times like these, you're supposed to go with "tanuki", right!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Are you being serious, Onee-san? There's not even a picture of a tanuki anywhere, and there isn't even a "ta" to start with.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah... Uhh, th-then, let's just take out all the capitalized letters to start!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh, should we really mess around with it that much?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> That's one way of thinking about it. If we take out all the uppercase... Tsu ha no ru no ya ki?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Tsuha no Runoyaki? If you read it backwards... Kiya no Runohatsu?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Is that a treasure?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Maybe it could be...?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> It isn't going to be so sim... Hm? Hang on...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ahhh! Wait, stop, Suzuka-onee-san! I'll come up with the answer, so you don't say anything!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...Very well then.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Let's solve it together, Tsubakuro-san!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Why? I'll be the one to solve it, so you can just sit down, Onee-san.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Don't be like that; won't it be more fun to figure it out together?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> I've been waiting for this, aradama-chan!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Tsubakuro-san! We should fight the aradama too, so we can get a hint!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I can solve it on my own. Suzuka-onee-san didn't need a hint, so I don't either.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Hono-chan, there's the hint! The hint for this question is...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Don't read it out loud, Kiyoka! I'm still thinking!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Tsuha no runoyaki, tsuha noru no yaki...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Oh, I got it!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ahh!? Tsubakuro-san, don't say it!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh, but if we had to wait on you, Onee-san, the time would run out.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> If it comes down to this... Kiyoka! Show me the hint!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Here you go, Hono-chan.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Okay, okay... Mm? Wait, I already know there's treasures, but...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> In that case, how about this hint?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Umm... Ah! So that's how it is! To get the answer, we just have to do this, right?<br><strong>Hint 1:</strong> There are three treasures.<br><strong>Hint 2:</strong> Toji come with what?<br><strong>Hint 3:</strong> Sort them out.  </p><h2 id="4-the-break-room" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>4: The Break Room</h2><p><strong>Yume:</strong> The answer is "Sohayanotsuruki, Suijingiri Kanemitsu, Echizen Yasutsugu"!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Sohayanotsuruki is Chie's, Suijingiri Kanemitsu is Yomiyomi's, and Echizen Yasutsugu is my okatana!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Is there some reason why it's those three?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I wonder about that...? It is interesting, but for now, let's move on forward!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> So, in this room we've got another two letters... And next to them, some cakes.<br><strong>Letter from the White Rabbit:</strong> Only a little bit further to the boss! But before that, take a quick break!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Does that mean we can eat these cakes?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Nice-! Which one should I have?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I want this shortcake here. I'm gonna try it-!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Stop right there.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I don't believe they'd leave us these cakes without some deeper reason.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> You're overthinking it. They told us we could eat them, so what's wrong with it?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> They did not say we could eat them. Mashiko-san, what is the question this time?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> It's right here.<br><strong>[Q3]:</strong> A: eaiohinebtehexo B: tlewtohaercherm C: ascfasttloatnto<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> "Eaiohinebtehexo"...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> "Tlewtohaercherm"...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> "Ascfasttloatnto"?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> I don't get it. Must be because I don't have enough sugar in my system. Maybe we ought to eat some cake after all.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I know! I've got a good idea! Let's make it a competition!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> A competition?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Yes! The first person to solve the question gets to eat the cakes!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I don't see anything wrong with that. If we don't put some restriction on it, someone may eat the cake out from under us.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> ...We just have to solve the question first? Then, I'm gonna figure it out before anybody else!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Kiyoka, let's figure it out together! Then we can split the cakes!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Okay! I'll do my best, Hono-chan!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> You okay with this, Ellen? These cakes are the ones from that bakery you love so much, aren't they?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Of course I am! Rather than eating them normally, eating them after I've won them is going to make them taste that much better!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Now then, what connection is there between A, B, and C... Reading them in reverse... It doesn't seem to mean anything.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> WAAH-! Don't do that, Suzuka-onee-san! If you try hard to solve it, you'll figure it out right away!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> That's the nature of the competition. I'm not about to hold back on you, you know.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Suzuka-onee-san's getting serious!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Though, in spite of that... However I look at it, I can't find the answer.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> From the way that it's listed out, there must be some way to read it...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Hmmm, I'm not sure how though...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Judging from the previous rooms, there should be something simple we aren't getting that will make it solvable...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Something simple...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Ah! Eavesdropping is off limits, Hanahana!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Come now, don't put it so harshly. You said it loud enough for me to overhear.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> The alphabet... Removing any repeated letters... Hmm, they all seem to be wrong.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> It's aradama-chan time!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I'm going to get the hints!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Kiyoka, we have to try too!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Right!<br><strong>Everyone:</strong> HAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Umm... What is this? This hint's no good!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Onee-san, give me your hint!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Ahh, sure. Here.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Thanks! ...Wait, what are you supposed to do with this!?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ahhhhh, Fukki, how could you... Kiyoka, what about your hint!?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Don't worry, Hono-chan! This should be enough!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ahh, you onee-sans can already solve it!? Suzuka-onee-san!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Oh my, are you coming to me for help?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> If they're going to split the cakes in half, we can do that too!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> What am I ever going to do with you. Then, let's not waste time... Ahh, so that's how it is.<br><strong>Hint 1:</strong> From the start.<br><strong>Hint 2:</strong> In order.<br><strong>Hint 3:</strong> A&gt;C&gt;B<br><strong>Hint 4:</strong> Vertically.  </p><h2 id="5-the-traitor-room" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>5: The Traitor Room</h2><p><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yume, you may eat a piece of whichever cake you like.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Huh? But we still haven't solved it yet!?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Konohana-san's cheating!?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> You do speak so poorly of me. But eating a piece of cake is the solution.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Huh? Why's that the right answer?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> That's how it was written. If you try reading them all at once, top down from A to C to B, you'll understand.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> "Eat a slice of what is on the table to reach the next room"...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Kaoru: If somebody'd just snuck in a bite, we would have solved this easy.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah, that's true...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> B-But, in that case, we wouldn't have realized we solved it...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Now then, let's move on to the next room. If the other letter was correct... The next may be the final room.<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> BUUUOOOOOOOO!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> The boss is an aradama!?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> There's no way they'd leave aradama here as the boss!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Kohagura-san is right. Before we can solve that mystery, we'll have to defeat these aradama!!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> The spectrum finder isn't reading anything anymore.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> What, is that all of them?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> They were way too weak! I didn't get to have any fun at all.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> And anyway, they didn't give us a hint card either; we got a letter instead.  </p><h2 id="r-there-is-a-traitor-among-you-listen-to-the-white-rabbit-to-find-who-can-stop-them" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[R]: There is a traitor among you.

Chichie's the one setting this up, right? I'm thinking that makes Mihocchi the number one suspect.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Kofuki-san, your smile's giving it away.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Ah, seriously!?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Huh? Wh-What do you mean, Kiyoka!?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It means she never actually thought you were the traitor.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> After all, there's no way Hono-chan could keep up an act for that long, is there?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Th-That's true! Thank goodness...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Then the traitor's gotta be Suzuka-onee-san, right? Suzuka-onee-san's a good actor, isn't she?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> True, I think I could manage it. However, I am not the traitor.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Are you lying...?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I am not! More importantly, "find who can stop them"... That part interests me.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ah, she changed the subject! That's fishy...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Come to think of it... Konohana-san's been leading the way when it comes to solving the questions, hasn't she?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> That sort of doesn't seem like something she'd do...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> You're right... Now that you mention it, maybe Hanahana's acting strange... I think...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> That's because, with myself and Yume here, I decided this incident was affecting Yukari-sama!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Bringing up Yukari-sama now sounds even more fishy...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...It seems nothing I can say would help at this point. I'll only say this.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I am not the traitor.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Hmph. You can say whatever you want... Cause beating you is gonna solve this faster.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> That's the trouble with you... You should think things through more before you act, Yume.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> You're being too aggressive! This is just a game, okay? There's no need to get violent!<br><strong>Suzuka/Yume:</strong> ......<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Come on, are you listening to me!?<br>Throughout the story so far, there are hints to the traitor's identity.</p><p><strong>Hint 1:</strong> Combine all the answers, and what do you get?  </p><h2 id="6-escape" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>6: Escape!</h2><p><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Oi, Yume. Suzuka's not the traitor.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Isn't that right, Ellen.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> ...Huh? What are you talking about?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh-? It's not Suzuka-onee-san?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> You're the traitor, aren't you. Ellen.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Umm... Isn't Ellen-san the one who can stop the traitor...?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> By "listen to the white rabbit", it means the person who all the answers pointed to so far, right?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> See, look, the last question's the only one that's different.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> There wasn't the usual letter from the white rabbit, and the letter on the question is "R" instead of "Q".<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah! You're right... Since we're still in the escape room game, this is another part of the riddle, isn't it!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> That's how it goes. Which means... The white rabbit didn't write the last question. It's a fake.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Huh? Then, who did write it?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> The traitor, of course.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> The question wasn't about finding who could stop the traitor, it was about discovering who the traitor is.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...I should have been able to see through such a simple trick, if only I were thinking more clearly.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> If the traitor is the one who wrote it... Then that makes whoever the questions indicated the most suspicious.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Which means, she is a toji, a "buddy", owns one of the three okatana, her favorite cakes were in the room...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> It does all point to Kohagura-san.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> It's not like you could help it when the fingers were pointing at you.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> ...Uu, I'm sorry, Suzuka-onee-san.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I can't blame you, in these circumstances.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> So, how'd I do?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Bingo bingo-! You're right on the money! The final question of the escape room game has been cleared!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> That's my Kaoru! You stole the show right at the end!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Nah, I knew halfway through that you were working with whoever's running this.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Eh!? Since when!?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Even though you got dragged into an escape room game, you were acting way less excited than you should have been.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> So, I thought that was suspicious... But I wasn't sure until we got to the cakes.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Under normal circumstances, you would've eaten them right away.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I don't think I like how confident you are about that.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> But I'm not wrong, right?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> And you only offered to do a competition because you already knew the answer. Right?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> ...I really am no match for you, Kaoru.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Now then... Here, the last key! Kaoru, please open the door.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> I didn't think we could've been moved very far... But we're right here!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Great work, all of you!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah, Mirja-san! You were helping run this too?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Yes. Originally, I was meant to reach the third mistake early on and retire.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> However... We didn't imagine that, before I could do that, you would reach three mistakes, Asakura Mihono...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Asakura Mihono, you need to have a greater sense of caution before you act.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> A-Ahaha...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> What, you were here too? Which means, you actually supplied the aradama?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> No, that was a random occurrence. We wouldn't leave out aradama for an escape room game.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> So, what was this all for anyway?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Actually, some toji have been brainstorming ideas for attractions to liven up the area... This was a beta test for that.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Just so you know, you can hire testers for those.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> About that... Under normal circumstances, the hints were meant to be hidden in places where you can find them, but...<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> For some reason, right before the test, aradama seem to have made off with them.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> At that point... Ellen-san came up with a plan to get you all to help.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> So it was your fault after all!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> But it was fun, wasn't it? We have to thank Yukari-sama for allowing Hanahana and Yumecchi to join in too!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> So you did get Yukari-sama's approval.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Well, it wasn't that bad of a way to spend some time.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> (Yukari-sama approved of this... She's actually pretty free spirited, isn't she?)<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah, the movie! Kiyoka, Fukki, if we leave now, we can still make it! Let's go!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Oh yeah, we were gonna do that.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Ah, hang on! Here, free vouchers for the cafeteria. It's your prize for clearing within the time limit.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Thank you very much. If there's anything else we can do to help, let us know.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Of course, you're a big help.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Now then, Yume and I must return to our duties as the elite guard.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Please put on the best escape room game you can.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Seeya later! It was pretty fun.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Alright, the rest of us here are going to hold a strategy meeting on what to improve for the opening!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> The rest of us here... Wait, I'm here!?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> No complaining; come help us, Kaoru!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Let's re-examine the beta test so we can produce an entertaining escape room game.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Ah, then, can we intentionally place aradama in there now? The types we can use are limited, but it's proven to work.<br><strong>Everyone:</strong> Out of the question!<br><div><iframe width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tSsi3HMt5qU"></iframe></div>  </p><h2 id="fairytale-mihono-start-off-to-wonderland" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Fairytale Mihono: Start]: Off to Wonderland</h2><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> ......I don't get it at allll.
