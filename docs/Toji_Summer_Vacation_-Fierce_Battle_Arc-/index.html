Hey, hey, Yomi onee-san! Look, it&#x27;s the sea, the sea~!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes, it&#x27;s the sea. However, we&#x27;re on alert right now.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Come on~, act a little more excited~. Yukari-sama~, how long do we have to wait for~?<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Only a little longer. Maki and Suzuka should be back from inspecting the site soon.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> But weren&#x27;t all the aradama beaten yesterday? So there&#x27;s no reason for us to be here, right? I keep hearing there&#x27;s not enough people, so we didn&#x27;t have to come all this way...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Since they already took care of everything, we should just play on the beach. Can&#x27;t we? Yukari-sama~.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ...Yume, we don&#x27;t have time to play around, you know?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> That&#x27;s right. We&#x27;re still here on a mission.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Booo-, that&#x27;s so boring~.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Maki, Suzuka, you&#x27;re back. What did the Special Ritual Squad have to say?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Yes. As you know, the aradama were suppressed, and their cleanup work was finished sometime yesterday.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> However, not long ago, a lecturer from Minoseki, Tanaka Taeko, sent in an interesting report--<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> ...I see. I wasn&#x27;t aware this region had such a legend.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yes. After receiving this report, the Special Ritual Squad is currently continuing their investigation into the area.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Hm...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Hello. This is the elite guard, Kohohana Suzuka speaking.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...Eh!? Are you sure!?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> What&#x27;s wrong?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Well... The people investigating the mountainside are reporting that another mass outbreak of aradama occurred.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Suzuka, tell them we&#x27;ll be right there.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> By that you mean, you&#x27;ll be coming too...! Yes, I understand!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Yomi, Yume, are you prepared?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes. I can go at any time.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh~, just when I thought I&#x27;d get to play on the beach~.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Yume, you&#x27;re still going on about that--<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Leave her be, Maki. Yume, after this mission is over, you can play as much as you like.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> No way-!? Really!?<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Yes, if that&#x27;s what&#x27;s needed to motivate you for this mission. You may be the elite guard, but that doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re above having time off.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Hooray-! Then let&#x27;s get alll~ of these aradama beaten already!<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Maki, there should be three members of the Akabane swords investigation team in the area. Send them a directive. The more help the better.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Yes, right away.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Then, let&#x27;s move. We will now eradicate all the aradama appearing on the mountainside.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="2-take-back-our-summer-vacation"></a>2: Take Back Our Summer Vacation!<a class="hash-link" href="#2-take-back-our-summer-vacation" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> Nnn... I thought we&#x27;d finally get to have our summer vacation, but now we&#x27;re back doing this again...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It&#x27;s okay. We just have to beat all the aradama again.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> You sound confident. Very different from when I found you yesterday.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Yes. I realized something. It&#x27;s only us toji who can protect the summer vacation everyone&#x27;s looking forward to.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> And also, I have all of you here with me now.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> However, are you all sure about assisting us? You didn&#x27;t receive any such order from President Maniwa this time, did you?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Even so, we want to help! This ship&#x27;s already sailed!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Mm. Let&#x27;s not make this so impersonal.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> When we&#x27;re done, we can all play together again.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Guys... Thank you so much! Makes me feel all warm inside!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...So, why&#x27;re you here again?<br>
<strong>Emily:</strong> Uhh... Wh-What&#x27;s the harm in it!<br>
<strong>Emily:</strong> With this many of you toji around, you should have no trouble keeping me safe!<br>
<strong>Emily:</strong> (Fu Fu Fu...! To think, so many toji I&#x27;ve had my eyes on would gather in one place like this-- I&#x27;d never let this opportunity to gather data up close and personal escape me!)<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Oh... That&#x27;s quite the evil look in your eyes. What do you think, Kaoru? Should we bury her in the beach again?<br>
<strong>Emily:</strong> No-! Never do that again!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> ...At any rate, why do you think these mass outbreaks of aradama are occurring around this mountain specifically?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I don&#x27;t know, but if we can&#x27;t figure out why, the same thing might keep happening again, won&#x27;t it?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mai, do you know anything about this?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I don&#x27;t. My family does own a private beach here, but we might only ever come here once per year... Sorry, Sayaka-chan.<br>
<strong>Emily:</strong> Fuhahahaha! It seems the time has come to prove my usefulness!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Huh? You know something about this?<br>
<strong>Emily:</strong> Yes! Actually, there&#x27;s a legend of a greatly powerful large scale aradama that was once in this area!<br>
<strong>Emily:</strong> No precise records of it remain, but the legend itself has been passed down amongst the locals through oral tradition.<br>
<strong>Emily:</strong> According to them, that large aradama would lead a legion of smaller aradama in an attack on the nearby village. But each time, the local toji would exterminate the smaller aradama and the large one would be subdued.<br>
<strong>Emily:</strong> However, that large aradama could never be entirely suppressed, and so these conflicts continued over many generations--<br>
<strong>Emily:</strong> Until that lineage of toji was broken off. At the same time, for unknown reasons, the large aradama abruptly disappeared... Or that&#x27;s how the legend goes.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I see. The part about the smaller aradama certainly corresponds to the current situation...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> But, why do you know all that, Emily-san?<br>
<strong>Emily:</strong> Well that&#x27;s simple! I only visited this town in the first place to further investigate this legend!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> If it&#x27;s so simple, why didn&#x27;t you say something sooner, huh?<br>
<strong>Emily:</strong> As it happens, my interest shifted to something else! It completely slipped my mind! Fuahahaha!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Ahh, I&#x27;m tired of talking to you. But, that legend...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Yes. It sounds like the Mashiko family, doesn&#x27;t it?<br>
<strong>Nene:</strong> Ne-, nene-.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Eh? So then...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Hold that thought, Asakura Mihono. We can continue later.<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> GUAAAAAAAAAA!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> There they are! They look just like the type from yesterday!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> We&#x27;ll have to take care of the aradama first, then!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="3-fight-for-the-watermelon"></a>3: Fight for the Watermelon<a class="hash-link" href="#3-fight-for-the-watermelon" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Aradama:</strong> GUAAaaaa...<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Good, we&#x27;ll push the front-line forward. Instruct the toji in the rear to begin recovering noro.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Understood! Suzuka, Yomi, Yume! From here on out, let no aradama approach Yukari-sama!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I&#x27;m on it.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh~? I&#x27;m pretty sure Yukari-sama&#x27;ll be fine on her own though~?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Don&#x27;t be like that. As the elite guard, this is our duty to fulfill.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> She&#x27;s right, Yume. As the elite guard, we are the swords which form Yukari-sama&#x27;s shield.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> If you say so... Ah, hey, by the way. Doesn&#x27;t it seem like the aradama around here are only going after toji?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Eh...?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Now that you mention it, you may be right. The aradama could avoid us if they wanted, yet their only intent seems to be attacking us.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Does that mean, with Yukari-sama&#x27;s decision to push up the front-line, she anticipated this...? But why is it the aradama are only targeting toji?<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Maki, Suzuka, keep your guard up!<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> O-OOOoo oo...<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> You can&#x27;t allow your mind to wander on a battlefield. Whatever the aradama&#x27;s intent, we toji are here to defeat them. Think of nothing but fulfilling that objective.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Yes ma&#x27;am! Suzuka, I&#x27;m counting on you!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Of course, leave it to me.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ooh~, they&#x27;re getting into it~.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Hey-, Yukari-sama-! Since we&#x27;re here together, why don&#x27;t we have a contest between the two of us to see who can beat the most aradama!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> And if I win, you&#x27;ll buy me a watermelon afterwards! A big round one! You&#x27;re fine with that, right-?<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> ...Fine, I have no issue with that. But only on the condition that you obey my orders. Those are the terms of our contest.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ahaha! Yes-! Then, it&#x27;s about time I got serious-!<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> GAAAAAAaaa...!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ahahahaha! More and more-!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Come back, Yume! You&#x27;re getting too far ahead!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Thbbbb-. This is between me and Yukari-sama. So I don&#x27;t have to listen to you, Maki onee-san!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Ah-, I can&#x27;t believe her...!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> When she gets like this, Yume&#x27;s quite the nuisance.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> ...Yomi, go support Yume. However, so long as I live, let her act freely. Rather than being restricted under someone else, she can accomplish more this way.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I understand.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Maki, Suzuka, we&#x27;re pushing forward as well.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="4-the-legends-similarity"></a>4: The Legend&#x27;s Similarity<a class="hash-link" href="#4-the-legends-similarity" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Aradama:</strong> GUOooo oo...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Pant... Pant... Pant...!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I think that&#x27;s the last of them... For now...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Phew... Do you think we should take a break, everyone? We don&#x27;t know how many aradama are lurking ahead, so we should rest while we can.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> You&#x27;re right, we should do that.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Ahhh, I don&#x27;t wanna get back up. Feels like there&#x27;s way more of them than yesterday... If only somebody here would go get our stuff for us...<br>
<strong>Emily:</strong> What!? You expect me to carry your things now!<br>
<strong>Emily:</strong> &quot;Hooray, hooray, everyone-! You can do it, you can do it, everyone-!&quot; --Hasn&#x27;t my cheering been enough for you?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> All I remember is wondering who was making that racket...<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> It gets busy while we&#x27;re fighting, so I didn&#x27;t notice.<br>
<strong>Emily:</strong> Ughh, how disheartening. I&#x27;ll suppose I&#x27;m off to stare into space for a bit then.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Yeah, go right ahead.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> ...By the way, Yanase Mai. I&#x27;d like to ask your opinion on something, while we have the time.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I was about to bring something up myself. It&#x27;s about the aradama, isn&#x27;t it?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Did you two find out anything?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Actually... I&#x27;m not entirely sure of it yet, but at times the aradama we&#x27;ve encountered seem to be deliberately pursuing us toji.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Even when injured they don&#x27;t try to run away, and when they&#x27;re far enough that it wouldn&#x27;t be odd if they ignored us, they suddenly change course to attack.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Huh? Really? I didn&#x27;t notice any of that.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> But, why would they do that? Do the aradama here only go after toji?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> I think the Mashiko family&#x27;s story might help explain.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Oh yeah, didn&#x27;t you say they were sort of alike before?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Yes. Kaoru will explain the details.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Oi...! Fine, if I have to...<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> In Tochigi, near the Futarasan shrine, &quot;Nene&quot; would go on rampages. For hundreds of years we built up a long history of fighting it.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Anyway, after all that fighting, we came to an understanding with &quot;Nene&quot;...<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> So what&#x27;s similar is, in this legend with the big aradama, the &quot;toji from around here had been fighting it for countless generations&quot; part.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> That&#x27;s why I was wondering if maybe that lineage of toji had the same line of thinking as the Mashikos.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> To summarize, you believe that large aradama could have ended up in a similar relationship with those old toji as the current Mashiko family shares with Nene. Is that correct?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Nah, I wouldn&#x27;t go that far. But it seems like the big aradama might have decided those toji were a worthy rival, right?<br>
<strong>Mashiko:</strong> The proof is that, when this toji lineage ended, that&#x27;s when the big aradama disappeared all of a sudden too. Without its rivals around, it wasn&#x27;t interested.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I see...<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> But then in this case, why would that aradama return right now...?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Because it found some interesting rivals, don&#x27;t you think?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Wait, you mean... Us?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Yep. Probably.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> So like, the outbreak of aradama yesterday was to test our skills... Or something?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Then, after making its judgment, it began to act seriously? This sounds stranger than fiction, if I&#x27;m being honest...<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> But the story fits. The aradama are only targeting toji.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Well, what do you think, Nene-chan?<br>
<strong>Nene:</strong> Ne~?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Seems like he&#x27;s tilting his head hard in confusion.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Well, it figures.<br>
<strong>Emily:</strong> Ah-!? What&#x27;s the big idea, everyone!? Why does it seem like you just had a very interesting conversation without me!?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah, you didn&#x27;t get to hear...<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...Well we can&#x27;t rest forever; we should get going.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Agreed.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Okay-! Let&#x27;s keep giving our all!<br>

<strong>Yume:</strong> If you don&#x27;t know exactly how much, how&#x27;re we supposed to know who won?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Yume, focus on the mission at hand. If you don&#x27;t, you&#x27;ll screw up sooner or later, you know?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> These aradama are never gonna hit me, so don&#x27;t worry about it.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Really, you can be such a handful. However, it does seem the theory of these aradama only targeting toji was correct.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Right. Despite all the aradama we&#x27;ve encountered, none of the riot officers have been attacked.<br>

<strong>Yukari:</strong> You must be the legendary aradama of these parts. It seems Tanaka Taeko guessed correctly.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Hmmm, I don&#x27;t really get it, but that big one&#x27;s the boss, right?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Then that makes this easy, Yukari-sama. Whoever beats the boss is the winner! Hyaaaah!<br>

<strong>Yukari:</strong> Obey my orders. That&#x27;s what you promised.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Urgh... Fine, I get it-!<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> More importantly, Yume. Aside from the fleeing giant aradama, there&#x27;s countless prey for you here, isn&#x27;t there?<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> GURURURU....!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Yukari-sama... But what do you plan to do about the escaped aradama?<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> We aren&#x27;t the only toji responsible here. Defeating the aradama at their source is key, but our original objective was to eliminate every aradama that appeared.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Considering that, are you going to ignore this number of aradama? Do you believe anyone besides ourselves could deal with all this at once?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I... You have a point...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Our place is here, Maki-san. No one aside from Yukari-sama and we elite guard can accomplish this.<br>

<strong>Hiyori:</strong> What was that!? That roar just now!?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> It must be, that tough aradama...!?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Um... Do you think, maybe, it&#x27;s calling to us...?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> What... Like it&#x27;s calling us out?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...It might be.<br>
<strong>Emily:</strong> E-Err~ This might be a naive question, but, can you actually beat it? This aradama that countless generations of toji didn&#x27;t destroy.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Well...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> But... We have to go, don&#x27;t we?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Yes. No matter what sort of aradama we face, so long as it might threaten people&#x27;s lives, we can&#x27;t afford to leave it.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Whatever, let&#x27;s get this over with... If things get rough, we&#x27;ll just run away I guess.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Of course, we&#x27;ll stick together to the end.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Kiyoka, Mirja-san, and everybody...!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Alright! Let&#x27;s do this! This time for sure, we&#x27;ll take back our summer vacation!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="7-summer-vacation-is-right-before-our-eyes"></a>7: Summer Vacation Is Right Before Our Eyes!<a class="hash-link" href="#7-summer-vacation-is-right-before-our-eyes" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Aradama:</strong> GAAAaaa aaa...<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> ...That was the last of them. Maki, is anyone hurt?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Pant... Pant... Pant... N-No... Everyone... Should be fine...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yukari... Sama... I&#x27;m sorry... You had to do most of the work, in the end...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Pant... Wheeze... Wheeze... Why don&#x27;t... You have... A single drop of sweat, Yukari... Sama...?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Pant... Pant...<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Just try not to move for a while, all of you. You fought well. Rest for now.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I have no excuse... As a member of the elite guard, to be so unable to protect Yukari-sama...<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Maki, your sternness is a strength of yours, but not if it leads to you being overly critical of yourself.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> If that&#x27;s how feel, you only need to become stronger. Understand?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ...Yes ma&#x27;am!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ah, oh yeah-- In the middle of fighting, I totally forgot to keep count!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Hey, Yomi onee-san. Do you know?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> The number of aradama you defeated, Tsubakuro-san? No, I was too busy to keep track.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh, then...? My contest with Yukari-sama...?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> If we don&#x27;t know the numbers, then we can&#x27;t declare a winner.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> No way~!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Awww~... I tried my hardest too... I really... Wanted that watermelon...<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Yume, don&#x27;t be so down. You can buy what you want when we get back. I&#x27;ll allow it.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh!? Seriously!? Alright!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Hey, Onee-sans-! Let&#x27;s play split the watermelon later!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Honestly, that girl... There&#x27;s simply no refusing her, is there.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> But Yukari-sama, will the investigation team members you ordered to suppress the large aradama be able to handle themselves?<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> There&#x27;s no need to worry. They&#x27;re toji, the same as you, after all.<br>
<strong>Large Aradama:</strong> GUAAAAAAAAAAAA!!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> There it is! That must be the one, from the legend--<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I-It&#x27;s so big... More than I imagined...<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Can we really win against something like that...?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...I don&#x27;t know.<br>
<strong>Emily:</strong> Hawawawawa... I propose we try for a strategic sort of retreat!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Hmmm... Hey, do you think that when we beat that aradama, we might become friends?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Like what happened with the Mashiko family and Nene-chan. If we come to respect each other&#x27;s strength, or something.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Mihono, you... Heh, I can&#x27;t tell if you&#x27;re that clueless or that confident.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Mihomiho doesn&#x27;t have an ounce of fear in her! She&#x27;s already decided we&#x27;re going to win.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I mean, I&#x27;m not sure how, but I&#x27;m sure we can do it!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> We&#x27;ve all been fighting together since yesterday, you know. With all of us together, I don&#x27;t care who we&#x27;re up against, we&#x27;d never lose.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Fu... I can&#x27;t call it logical or tactical, but it&#x27;s certainly like you.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I agree with Hono-chan! If we all fight together, I know we&#x27;ll win!<br>
<strong>Large Aradama:</strong> GUAAAAAAAAAA!!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Let&#x27;s do this, everyone! Our summer vacation&#x27;s right before our eyes!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="8-one-summers-memories"></a>8: One Summer&#x27;s Memories<a class="hash-link" href="#8-one-summers-memories" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Large Aradama:</strong> GUAAAAaaaa aaaa... ........ ....<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Did we beat it...?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Watanabe Emily. Can you check its noro?<br>
<strong>Emily:</strong> Ah, could you give me some room for a minute? Like that, thank you.<br>
<strong>Emily:</strong> Hmmhmm... Hoho, now this is interesting. There&#x27;s not a single drop of noro in here!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Which means... We didn&#x27;t truly defeat it?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Ahh, maybe. But that&#x27;s enough, isn&#x27;t it?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> That aradama went all out against us and used up all its strength, so it should be quiet for a while, right?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm. We did what we needed to.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> ...That&#x27;s right. Why don&#x27;t we leave uncovering the truth of the matter to those of the Special Ritual Squad assigned to process this matter?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> What if the toji back then went through this every year?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Then after repeating these heated battles every summer, eventually toji and aradama might form a bond... You never know!<br>
<strong>Nene:</strong> Ne-!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Phew... At least, that&#x27;s this time done with. Now...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> We can finally get back to our summer vacation!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Sounds good! Then let&#x27;s go right back to Mai&#x27;s family&#x27;s beach! I wanna play in the sea till my hands get all wrinkly!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Here it comes-! Take that-!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Kyaaa! But, I&#x27;m not giving up-!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Did you hear, Hiyoyon? Apparently Yukari-sama and the elite guard are enjoying some time off just down the beach from here.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> The elite guard is one thing, but Yukari-sama...? Hmph, she would never do something like that. I don&#x27;t believe it one bi--pfffhtpht!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Ahahaha! You were wide open!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> They&#x27;re sure having a good time-. But the way an adult enjoys the ocean is meant to be laid back and relaxed, like this. Am I right, Nene?<br>
<strong>Nene:</strong> Ne-!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Everyone, the shaved ice is ready-!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Snore-, snore-... Nnn, if I eat any more my stomach&#x27;ll freeze...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Let&#x27;s come back next year, everyone... Mumble mumble...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> This won&#x27;t do... One slice of watermelon per person...<br>
<strong>Taeko:</strong> They&#x27;re all sound asleep. Those are some nice expressions.<br>
<strong>Taeko:</strong> ...Except for that one.<br>
<strong>Emily:</strong> Uheheh... All this precious data... Right down to their three sizes... Uhehehehh...</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations/edit/docs/Toji_Summer_Vacation_-Fierce_Battle_Arc-.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_2_ui" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_3DPF"></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"></div></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_35-E thin-scrollbar"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#1-what-wakes-in-the-summer" class="table-of-contents__link">1: What Wakes in the Summer</a></li><li><a href="#2-take-back-our-summer-vacation" class="table-of-contents__link">2: Take Back Our Summer Vacation!</a></li><li><a href="#3-fight-for-the-watermelon" class="table-of-contents__link">3: Fight for the Watermelon</a></li><li><a href="#4-the-legends-similarity" class="table-of-contents__link">4: The Legend&#39;s Similarity</a></li><li><a href="#5-origami-yukaris-seriousness" class="table-of-contents__link">5: Origami Yukari&#39;s Seriousness</a></li><li><a href="#6-large-aradama-suppression-order" class="table-of-contents__link">6: Large Aradama Suppression Order</a></li><li><a href="#7-summer-vacation-is-right-before-our-eyes" class="table-of-contents__link">7: Summer Vacation Is Right Before Our Eyes!</a></li><li><a href="#8-one-summers-memories" class="table-of-contents__link">8: One Summer&#39;s Memories</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Links</div><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://pastebin.com/LdyviZ8Z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Translator anon&#x27;s pastebin<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Site source code<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Built with Docusaurus.</div></div></div></footer></div>
