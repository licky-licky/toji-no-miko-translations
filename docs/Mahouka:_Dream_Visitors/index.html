<strong>Saegusa Mayumi:</strong> Sorry, for springing it on you so suddenly. Ordinarily, I would have wanted Mari and A-chan to come too.<br>
<strong>Kitayama Shizuku:</strong> We don&#x27;t get school trips at Magic High, so it does get hard for us to stay the night anywhere outside of chances like this.<br>
<strong>Angelina:</strong> They really make the school curriculum packed, don&#x27;t they.<br>
<strong>Chiba Erika:</strong> Yeah they do. That&#x27;s why you shouldn&#x27;t let it get to you, senpai.<br>
<strong>Shizuku:</strong> You would have preferred it if Tatsuya could come along, wouldn&#x27;t you, Miyuki?<br>
<strong>Shiba Miyuki:</strong> Going on a trip together with Onii-sama would be all I could ask for, but I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s not what Saegusa-senpai had in mind.<br>
<strong>Miyuki:</strong> And, when I told Onii-sama about this, he said not to mind him and enjoy myself.<br>
<strong>Erika:</strong> Tatsuya-kun seems like he&#x27;d come running in an instant if anything went wrong anyway-.<br>
<strong>Miyuki:</strong> Yes, that&#x27;s how Onii-sama is. Though, we should try to avoid letting anything that worrisome happen.<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> I&#x27;m so glad that you&#x27;re all looking forward to it. Ah, if any of you can&#x27;t sleep with a different pillow, don&#x27;t forget to bring your own.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="countdown-sleepover-part-2"></a>Countdown: Sleepover Part 2<a class="hash-link" href="#countdown-sleepover-part-2" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Honoka:</strong> Oh right, Shizuku. You said before you were looking something up to prepare for tonight; what was it?<br>
<strong>Shizuku:</strong> It&#x27;s almost summer, so I was thinking we could tell scary stories.<br>
<strong>Honoka:</strong> We finally get the chance to stay the night together, so I think it&#x27;d be better to talk about something else... Something besides scary stories!<br>
<strong>Miyuki:</strong> What sort of conversations would be appropriate for this then?<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> Talking about romance, right?<br>
<strong>Erika:</strong> Is there someone you&#x27;re interested in, Saegusa-senpai?<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> That stays a secret~.<br>
<strong>Shizuku:</strong> I have a feeling Honoka&#x27;s gaining more rivals.<br>
<strong>Honoka:</strong> Hey, Shizuku! Just because Tatsuya-san&#x27;s so charming doesn&#x27;t make us rivals...<br>
<strong>Angelina:</strong> You really do like Tatsuya, huh Honoka.<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> Fufu, you&#x27;ll have to tell us all about it tonight, okay?<br>
<strong>Honoka:</strong> Auuu~...<br>
<strong>Miyuki:</strong> By the way, what scary stories did you find, Shizuku?<br>
<strong>Shizuku:</strong> What&#x27;s been popular lately aren&#x27;t really scary stories, but strange stories. Whether or not it really happened, there&#x27;s stories of people suddenly going to a parallel world.<br>
<strong>Erika:</strong> Those are nothing more than people just making stuff up.<br>
<strong>Miyuki:</strong> Though, they do sound interesting. If you&#x27;d like, you can tell me about it later.<br>
<strong>Shizuku:</strong> I wasn&#x27;t expecting you to be interested, but alright. Wait till tonight.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="1-the-ultimate-image-training"></a>1: The Ultimate Image Training<a class="hash-link" href="#1-the-ultimate-image-training" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> Hey, Fukki. Do you know anything about this new training Tsugumi-san told us about?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Like I&#x27;d know. I only just heard we were doing training today.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> It seems we&#x27;ll be testing a new training method. I was told we would learn the details once we arrive at the lab.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> By the way, Chie-san. Didn&#x27;t you say you had something you needed to take care of after this?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> I do. If the training takes more than a few hours, then I think I&#x27;ll only stand in and watch.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Though, I don&#x27;t mean to dissapoint Tsugumi-chan...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I think I heard there&#x27;ll be people there besides the investigation team, so I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll be alright, Chie-san.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> What matters most is it&#x27;ll be stacked with girls!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> ...We should hurry.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah, Mihono-chan!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> So when they said there&#x27;d be people besides us, it was Kanami and Hiyori.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> We&#x27;re here too though-.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I see. With this many people assembled, it should be a full-fledged test.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Everyone. I see you&#x27;re all here. Thank you very much for coming.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Now, I&#x27;ll get straight to the point. Speaking from what we would like to achieve, we are looking for a means of utilizing dreams for training purposes.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> By dreams, you mean like what we see while we&#x27;re sleeping?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Yes. Our chief objective is to carry out the ultimate image training efficiently through dreams while sleeping.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> It may sound dubious, but there are hypotheses and examples pointing to the link between experiences while dreaming and actual improvement of ability in the field of sports.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> During this test, I will have you at least sleep for a period of several hours.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> So this is an experiment to determine if holding onto the image of &quot;doing&quot; from within a dream can lead to improvement of actual technique.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> That&#x27;s it exactly. What&#x27;s most important is that you form the strongest... The greatest image of yourself.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Training in your dreams! I think I might be really good at that!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> If it&#x27;s in a dream, you&#x27;d be able to do all kinds of crazy stuff!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> But, will you really be able to do it that easily?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I will be giving each of you strong support so you can have the experience you want to see while sleeping.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> As for what your dream will be like... Please form a concrete image of your ideal self.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Our ideal self... It&#x27;s a little hard to, when you ask us all of a sudden.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Well, so long as we can collect a variety of samples this time, that will be enough. It&#x27;s not an issue if you&#x27;re unable to see exactly the dreams you want, so I would appreciate it if you simply participated.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> It&#x27;s alright! I&#x27;ll think up the ideal Kiyoka-chan for you!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That&#x27;s not alright at all, Yui-chan... Don&#x27;t think up anything weird, okay?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Hmmm... What would be good? I guess I want to be strong at least.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I&#x27;m already strong, so I&#x27;d want something else-.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Instead of my ideal self or whatever, since we&#x27;ll be dreaming, don&#x27;t you want to try using magic and stuff?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Since we&#x27;re dreaming, I bet we could!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> That&#x27;ll be fun for sure! Fire and ice magic are pretty cliched, but I still wanna do them!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I know, right! I wanna try flying too!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Magic is definitely out of the question here...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Dreams... It may depend on your power of imagination, but, if you aren&#x27;t able to build from that experience in the real world, it wouldn&#x27;t be suitable for use as training...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Geez, why do you onee-sans have to make it so boring?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Well-, I wasn&#x27;t expecting magic either, but I think it could possibly work?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Though, it doesn&#x27;t suit the purpose of today&#x27;s test. This is ultimately a form of training for toji.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Right, yeah... Ahaha.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Our ideal self as a toji... That might be a little difficult to imagine. Though, it isn&#x27;t as if I don&#x27;t have a strength that I idealize.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Desires are something that will differ from person to person.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> But many toji would dream of suppressing aradama while keeping casualties to a minimum, or consider it their ideal.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Though, wishing all the aradama were gone might be the most common.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Count me out if all the aradama-chan are gone.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah, where are you going, Kofuki-san!?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> I&#x27;m not interested in training where there&#x27;s no aradama-chan.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Don&#x27;t worry. Shichinosato-san not participating was well within my expectations.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> I have to take care of something later too, so I won&#x27;t be able to participate in the training itself.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> If there&#x27;s anything I can help with instead, feel free to let me know.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I would appreciate it. Then, those of you who will be participating, please come with me. We&#x27;ll provide a comfortable environment for sleeping.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Please strongly visualize your ideal self. Do your best not to forget it.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Now then, everyone, pleasant dreams--<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Tsugumi-san&#x27;s training was over before you know it, but I feel like, right now, I can concentrate really hard on missions!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> This may be an especially effective training method for you, Asakura Mihono.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Since my okatana is an odachi, I thought I&#x27;d like to be able to decide things in a single hit when it counts, but that means I&#x27;ll have to work on my actual ability to read a situation.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Since I realized that at least, does that mean the training worked?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Yui-chan&#x27;s... getting very serious.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I am serious-. Since toji are girls, I&#x27;ve gotta protect them no matter what!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> What did you end up thinking about, Kanami?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> You know, I get the feeling that I dreamed about fighting in a match against you and Yume-chan. You were both really strong!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> And fighting tough opponents is the best training after all, so I might&#x27;ve gotten closer to my ideal.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Well, that might be one way to do it. Which means it might not be bad using that dream for training.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ahaha, even in her dreams, Kanami still acts like Kanami-.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> One step at a time, we can only work toward our goals through effort. Holding onto a firm image will be a good experience--<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Aradama!?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> A message came in... It seems we&#x27;ve been given orders to move out.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> We&#x27;ll hurry to the scene immediately!<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> GGGGGIIIII...!<br>
<strong>Chiba Erika:</strong> Come on already! What&#x27;s with... these things!? This whole time... there&#x27;s just no end to them!<br>
<strong>Shiba Miyuki:</strong> Erika, complaining won&#x27;t do any good. We may not be sure of what these strange things are, but we can&#x27;t leave them here.<br>
<strong>Miyuki:</strong> --HAAAH!<br>
<strong>Erika:</strong> Thanks, Miyuki! If they&#x27;re like this--<br>
<strong>Kitayama Shizuku:</strong> Miyuki&#x27;s cooling magic stopped the monsters here from moving.<br>
<strong>Mitsui Honoka:</strong> Thank goodness... Now we can catch our breath.<br>
<strong>Saegusa Mayumi:</strong> Still, what are these monstrous looking things in the first place...?<br>
<strong>Angelina:</strong>  Wait... Something&#x27;s not right! No way; Miyuki&#x27;s magic isn&#x27;t working...?<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> ...UUUUU!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> It looks like there&#x27;s some extra cute cuties fighting for some reason!?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Eh; you&#x27;re right!?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> We&#x27;ve gotta help them!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="2-strange-visitors"></a>2: Strange Visitors<a class="hash-link" href="#2-strange-visitors" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Miyuki:</strong> Thank you very much for your assistance.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> No, you don&#x27;t need to thank us. Suppressing aradama is our duty.<br>
<strong>Shizuku:</strong> So those monster looking things are called aradama.<br>
<strong>Erika:</strong> What&#x27;s the deal with our attacks not having any effect on them, anyway?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Only a toji carrying an okatana can exorcise an aradama.<br>
<strong>Erika:</strong> Ehh... What&#x27;s with that? Is that a thing?<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> So that would be why Miyuki-san&#x27;s magic didn&#x27;t do any more than hold them still...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...M-Magic!? Can you really use magic!?<br>
<strong>Honoka:</strong> Ah, we can. We&#x27;re students of Magic High School.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...Magic... high school?<br>
<strong>Angelina:</strong> It looks like... We both have lots of things we don&#x27;t know about each other.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Yes. That seems to be the case. I&#x27;d like to provide a better place for us to talk over the situation, so will you come with us?<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> We understand. Lead the way.<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> Then, summing it up, these aradama aren&#x27;t only the ones from earlier, but something like a natural disaster which appears frequently...<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> The ones specialized to combat them are toji like yourselves, and people have been aware of both aradama and toji long throughout history.<br>
<strong>Shizuku:</strong> ...Though, neither of them are common knowledge to us.<br>
<strong>Honoka:</strong> Yeah... But, why though... Maybe if we had Tatsuya-san here with us...<br>
<strong>Miyuki:</strong> That&#x27;s right. I&#x27;m sure that, if Onii-sama were with us, he would diminish the unease we feel now.<br>
<strong>Miyuki:</strong> But, Onii-sama isn&#x27;t here.<br>
<strong>Miyuki:</strong> Which is why we need to do all we can to return to the world with Onii-sama in it.<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> Miyuki-san has the right idea. Mm, it would be bad for us to lose hope here.<br>
<strong>Angelina:</strong> Well, knowing Tatsuya, he&#x27;ll figure something out as soon as he learns something happened to Miyuki.<br>
<strong>Erika:</strong> Ah, he totally would! Tatsuya-kun&#x27;s a real siscon, after all-.<br>
<strong>Miyuki:</strong> Honestly... I don&#x27;t need to hear that from you, Erika, Lina... Let&#x27;s leave the talk about Onii-sama at that.<br>
<strong>Miyuki:</strong> Otherwise, we&#x27;d be inconveniencing everyone. They made time to meet with us here, after all.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> It sounds like your brother is really something else, uh, Miyuki-san?<br>
<strong>Miyuki:</strong> Yes, I&#x27;m very proud of him. Ah... I&#x27;m sorry. Please, continue what you were saying.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I know, I know! Mirja-san, I have a suggestion to make-!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> And what is that, Yamashiro Yui.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Shouldn&#x27;t we introduce ourselves around now? It&#x27;s awkward not knowing each other&#x27;s names.<br>
<strong>Erika:</strong> I&#x27;m on board with that! My name&#x27;s Chiba Erika. It looks like we&#x27;ll be in your care for a while, so treat us well~.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Pleased to meet you, Erika-san! I&#x27;m Yamashiro Yui!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I&#x27;m Asakura Mihono.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> You might be worried, but I&#x27;m sure we can get a place to stay and stuff for you, so don&#x27;t worry about it!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Right?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I contacted Shidou Maki earlier, and she&#x27;s working to prepare dorm rooms for you all to live in.<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> My name is Saegusa Mayumi. Thank you very much for helping us here. We can&#x27;t thank you enough for your kindness.<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> All of us attend the National Magic University Affiliated First High School. And also, I&#x27;m a third year, while the others are all first years.<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> I know. How about we all introduce ourselves first for now? I think it&#x27;ll go more smoothly if we decide on an order like that.<br>
<strong>Miyuki:</strong> That makes sense. Then, I will go next. My name is Shiba Miyuki. It&#x27;s a pleasure to meet you.<br>
<strong>Angelina:</strong> I&#x27;m Angelina Kudou Shields. It&#x27;s sort of a mouthful, so I&#x27;d appreciate it if you just called me Lina.<br>
<strong>Shizuku:</strong> Kitayama Shizuku. Nice to meet you. Come on, it&#x27;s your turn, Honoka. Show them your magic while you introduce yourself.<br>
<strong>Honoko:</strong> Hey... Shizuku!? It&#x27;s not like you did that during your turn...<br>
<strong>Miyuki:</strong> Wouldn&#x27;t that be alright? So long as you control the power output, flash magic shouldn&#x27;t be very dangerous to show off.<br>
<strong>Honoka:</strong> Not you too, Miyuki...<br>
<strong>Honoka:</strong> Sigh... Then, only a little. It&#x27;s going to be bright, so please don&#x27;t look directly at it.<br>
<strong>Honoka:</strong> ...This is the kind of magic I&#x27;m best at.<br>
<strong>Honoka:</strong> Ahh... That was nerve-wracking.<br>
<strong>Miyuki:</strong> Honoka. You forgot to tell them your name.<br>
<strong>Honoka:</strong> ...AH! I-I&#x27;m Mitsui Honoka... P-Pleased to meet you.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...So there really is magic.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Wow-! I heard there were people who could use magic, so I came along.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> That&#x27;s awesome! You saw that just now, right, Maki-onee-san? Isn&#x27;t that awesome?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Yeah... It was pretty surprising. My eyes are still flashing.<br>
<strong>Honoka:</strong> I&#x27;m sorry about that.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Nah, you don&#x27;t have to worry about it. It&#x27;s fine. I already got used to it. Anyway, it&#x27;s true, huh.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Now that Shidou Maki and the others have arrived, we can introduce ourselves. Those of us here now will likely be the ones supporting you too.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> My name is Kitora Mirja. It&#x27;s good to meet you.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Then, continuing on--<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Now, I&#x27;ll summarize the information we&#x27;ve heard from you. If I make any mistakes, please point it out.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> It&#x27;s difficult to believe, but... Firstly, magic seems to exist, and you are all from a world where people have established a system of technology based around it.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> It&#x27;s also still possible for you to use that magic now.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> A major question remaining is, we don&#x27;t understand why you have come to this world.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Mirja-san! The biggest reason&#x27;s gotta be magic! It&#x27;s magic!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> For sure-. I wanna see some more!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I understand how you two feel. However, I was stating it from a problem-solving perspective.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> That reminds me, if Shidou Maki is here, is it wrong of me to assume you can provide these girls with a place to stay?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Right... I wasn&#x27;t sure how to respond to this at first, but I couldn&#x27;t think of a reason you would lie like that.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Like Kitora mentioned before, since we aren&#x27;t sure how it is you came here, is it safe to say you don&#x27;t currently know how to return to your own world either?<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> Yes. Unfortunately, you&#x27;re correct that we don&#x27;t know anything about our situation.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> It&#x27;s going to take time then... We&#x27;ll have to conduct an investigation.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I&#x27;d like to have some sort of clue to start from, but you must be tired with all that&#x27;s happened. Would you like some time to rest or something to eat?<br>
<strong>Erika:</strong> Actually, I was just about starving, so I&#x27;d be really grateful for some food! And, while we eat, I want to hear more about you toji.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> We want to know more about magic too!<br>
<strong>Yume/Mihono:</strong> Yeah yeah!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Then, let&#x27;s go with that. If any of you wish to rest in your rooms, say the word and I&#x27;ll guide you straight there.<br>
<strong>Other:</strong> Looking for a Lead to Get Back Home<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> You were more focused during that last mission that usual, right?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah! Maybe it worked out that Tsugumi-san&#x27;s training gave me a kind of feeling to hold onto! I&#x27;ll try my best to focus a little bit longer when we&#x27;re fighting!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I&#x27;m getting even more excited to spar with you~! We&#x27;ve gotta do it together again, for sure!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I&#x27;m not gonna lose next time!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Huh? Are you onee-sans going to fight? Then, I wanna join in too! I can, can&#x27;t I?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> We weren&#x27;t doing it right now. Just making a promise to do it later.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Oh. Well that&#x27;s lame-. We should just do it right away.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Along with suppressing aradama, toji have various duties to attend to. In particular, Asakura-san has her business with the investigation team. She must be busy. And I&#x27;m sure she would want to fight when she can be at her best.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> What kind of ideal did you come up in the training the other day, Yume-chan?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Nnn, I don&#x27;t think I really had one. They told us to imagine the strongest ideal of ourself, but I&#x27;m already super strong!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...That&#x27;s Tsubakuro-san for you.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah, Miyuki-san! What are you all doing here?<br>
<strong>Miyuki:</strong> Hello. We were just looking at the state of the town and the passerbys.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Why were you doing that?<br>
<strong>Miyuki:</strong> We were thinking, if we came to this world, it must have had other effects somewhere. But, we ran into a problem...<br>
<strong>Shizuku:</strong> Since we only just got here, it&#x27;s hard for us to tell if anything&#x27;s off or different from before.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I see. So that&#x27;s what you were up to.<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> I&#x27;m sure you must be busy with your missions defeating aradama, but... Could you help us with this?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I&#x27;m on it! If anything catches my eye, I&#x27;ll let you know.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Preparing personnel specifically to investigate strange occurences would be difficult, but, when there are gaps in my duties, I&#x27;ll try organizing a system for people to make reports.<br>
<strong>Miyuki:</strong> Thank you very much.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Could you explain it more clearly so it&#x27;ll be easier to find? Since you onee-sans can use magic, does that mean there&#x27;d be magic and stuff?<br>
<strong>Honoka:</strong> ...You say magic and stuff, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s any easier for us.<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> Magic is something that requires aptitude, but, for us magicians, it&#x27;s commonplace, and there&#x27;s a countless variety to it.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Without something distinct to look for, I doubt we&#x27;ll be able to find any phenomena caused by magic either...<br>
<strong>Angelina:</strong> It might be enough just to look for anything that gave you &quot;a small out of place feeling&quot;. If you have any cases like that, we can go check it out and confirm whether it was really caused by magic.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> An out of place feeling. I wonder... if I can really tell. But, I&#x27;ll try looking!<br>
<strong>Miyuki:</strong> Please do, Mihono-san.<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> If there&#x27;s anything we can do, we&#x27;ll assist you, so feel free to ask us anything. Of course, that includes if you need help getting rid of aradama.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> According to the reports, there are situations where magic is useful against aradama, so we would be glad for your help then.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="3-something-off-in-this-world"></a>3: Something Off in this World<a class="hash-link" href="#3-something-off-in-this-world" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Several days have passed since meeting Miyuki and the others.</p><p><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Hono-chan, Yui-chan. It&#x27;s going your way!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Leave it to us, Kiyoka-chan!<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> GUOOOOOOO!!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Let&#x27;s go, Yui! --HAAAH!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I&#x27;m with you whenever you need me!<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Phew. That should be our mission done. Good work, the two of you.<br>
<strong>Erika:</strong> Man, I&#x27;ve been watching for a while, but you three have got some pretty good swordfighting skills.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ehehe. You think so-? Thanks a lot!<br>
<strong>Miyuki:</strong> Erika, are you interested, since you&#x27;re accustomed to swordfighting yourself?<br>
<strong>Erika:</strong> Well, just a bit.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ohh. You are?<br>
<strong>Erika:</strong> With my CAD-- a device that helps activate magic. Mine&#x27;s this baton I&#x27;m holding here.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Huh-! It kind of just looks like a normal baton though...<br>
<strong>Miyuki:</strong> Erika deploys magic sequences with her CAD and casts fortification magic on it.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> So, without that c a d... You can&#x27;t use magic?<br>
<strong>Miyuki:</strong> It&#x27;s not as if we can&#x27;t use it, but, when we do use magic, we generally use CAD to speed up the activation time.<br>
<strong>Miyuki:</strong> Though, it may be slightly difficult to understand for someone who isn&#x27;t familiar with magic...<br>
<strong>Erika:</strong> It&#x27;s probably pretty hard to get a handle on it.<br>
<strong>Erika:</strong> Ah, that&#x27;s right. I&#x27;ve got a question for you too! You can beat those aradama so long as you have an okatana, right? Then, if you lent me an okatana, could I fight?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You have to go through lots of training to become a toji, and, besides that... If an okatana doesn&#x27;t acknowledge you, you won&#x27;t be able to manifest its power properly... So...<br>
<strong>Miyuki:</strong> Fufu. You&#x27;re saying it won&#x27;t be possible for Erika.<br>
<strong>Erika:</strong> Well that sucks. I was thinking, if I could use an okatana too, then maybe I could help you guys out.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Just having you cheering us on is plenty! You&#x27;re good looking and you&#x27;ve got a great body, and Miyuki-san is so pretty I can&#x27;t wrap my head around it!<br>
<strong>Erika:</strong> Flattering me won&#x27;t get you anywhere~. Alright, how about we head back now.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Hopefully Mirja-san and Mayumi-san have found a clue to helping you get back home by now.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Putting it bluntly, we haven&#x27;t had any results at all so far.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Seriously~...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I had thought to  get Ban Tsugumi&#x27;s cooperation in finding any sort of lead, but it seems to have been a pointless trip.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Tsugumi-san isn&#x27;t here, is she...<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> It would have been nice to gain the help of a larger group of people.<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> Though, I suppose it&#x27;s difficult asking for advice with a topic like, &quot;How do we return home to a different world?&quot;<br>
<strong>Angelina:</strong> If something strange were going on because of us coming here, we might be able to come up with ideas based on that, but...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Konohana Suzuka and the others are sharing information, but there don&#x27;t seem to be any plainly obvious changes or abnormalities.<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> Why don&#x27;t we have a cup of a tea for now to give ourselves a change of pace? I think that&#x27;s important at times like these.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> It&#x27;s true that we should avoid overworking ourselves.<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> The tea here is quite good, isn&#x27;t it.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> It wasn&#x27;t made off the shelf, but seems like it was made brewed with tea leaves. I think that&#x27;s why it kept such a nice aroma.<br>
<strong>Angelina:</strong> Hmm, you know your stuff, Yomi.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> It&#x27;s nothing much. I just have a slight interest in it.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> That aside, was it really alright for us to sit with you?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> They&#x27;re the ones who invited us. You worry too much, Yomi-onee-san. We&#x27;d just gotten a break too-.<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> That&#x27;s right. You&#x27;re offering us support as well, Yomi-san.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Is there anything that&#x27;s troubling you, Mitsui Honoka, Kitayama Shizuku?<br>
<strong>Honoka:</strong> No. We&#x27;re fine now. We went around today to the shops that Kiyoka and Yui told us about, and bought some clothes too.<br>
<strong>Honoka:</strong> Though, it would have been nice if they could have come with us.<br>
<strong>Shizuku:</strong> They had a mission to take care of, so we couldn&#x27;t bother them.<br>
<strong>Honoka:</strong> Right. It must be difficult for all you toji. Are Kiyoka and the others still working?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Those girls should arrive here shortly. They only went to see a toji acquaintance of ours.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ah, there&#x27;s Mirja-san and everyone!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Nnnn.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> You look fairly down, Asakura Mihono.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> We couldn&#x27;t get in touch with Chie-san. ...She wasn&#x27;t in her room either.<br>
<strong>Honoka:</strong> Um, who is this Chie-san?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> An old friend of Mihono&#x27;s, and she&#x27;s like the big sister of our investigation team.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> What&#x27;s Chii-nee up to, anyway... I feel like we haven&#x27;t had any time to meet lately.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> That&#x27;s...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> (This past week we&#x27;ve had missions as the investigation team, so it isn&#x27;t as if we shouldn&#x27;t have had chances to meet.)<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> At times like these, you&#x27;ve gotta eat something sweet to get your spirits up!<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> Asakura-san, will it cheer you up if I give you some of my cake?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Uuu... Thank you, Mayumi-san!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> (It is slightly concerning after all...)<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I&#x27;ve been having a lot of missions together with you lately, Hiyori-chan. It&#x27;s sort of rare for that to happen.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> You&#x27;re right... That&#x27;s true.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Did something happen, Hiyori-chan? You&#x27;ve been looking like you&#x27;re worrying about something ever since our mission at noon.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> No, it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m worried about anything. There&#x27;s just something that&#x27;s been bothering me.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> It feels like we&#x27;ve been spending the days the same day after day... Doesn&#x27;t it feel like that to you?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Sort of, but I get what you&#x27;re saying.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> The places and times change up a little bit, but the missions are all the same... Like we&#x27;re fighting the same kind of aradama over and over.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> There&#x27;s slight differences. But, I guess you could call it claustrophibic; there&#x27;s this small sense of discomfort building...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> When did you first notice it?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> I can&#x27;t say exactly when... But, I think it was around the time we met Miyuki and the others.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Then, if we can pin down what exactly is causing that sense of discomfort--!<br>
<strong>Miyuki:</strong> It could be the reason why we came to this world... Or, it may at least lead to some sort of clue.<br>
<strong>Miyuki:</strong> That&#x27;s what you&#x27;re thinking, isn&#x27;t it, Hiyori-san.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Miyuki and Erika...<br>
<strong>Erika:</strong> Sorry for dropping in. We went out thinking we&#x27;d take a walk around at night, but then you two were sounding so serious talking. We couldn&#x27;t find a chance to join in.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> I was thinking I would have to tell everyone soon anyway.<br>
<strong>Erika:</strong> But, you know, that discomfort that you guys are feeling? If I had to say one way or the other, I haven&#x27;t noticed it at all. Everything in this world is new to me.<br>
<strong>Miyuki:</strong> That&#x27;s true. Toji and aradama. They&#x27;re things we aren&#x27;t used to and can hardly imagine.<br>
<strong>Miyuki:</strong> I think it&#x27;s wonderful that we were able to meet you, Kanami-san, Hiyori-san, but it all feels a bit like a dream.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah, it really is like a dream. Getting to hang out together with people from a world where magic is real...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> --Wait, it is a dream!? Hiyori-chan!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Yeah, I just realized it too.<br>
<strong>Erika:</strong> What do you mean?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Before we met you, we were doing a type of image training using dreams.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> So Sayaka, who should normally be here at Renpu, is gone too. We really can&#x27;t get anyone together besides the people here.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah. I tried sending messages to Mai-chan, Ellen-chan, and Kaoru-chan too, but they haven&#x27;t responded.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Juujou. It looks like you&#x27;ve figured something out, so could you tell us all?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I want to know what it is too, Juujou-san!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...This might all be a dream that we&#x27;re seeing.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Aside from Miyuki and them, the only people here are the ones who participated in the new dream training Tsugumi provided for us.<br>
<strong>Tojis:</strong> !!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> So we&#x27;ve been living on in the dream thinking that Ban-san&#x27;s training was over with?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Right. Everything looks so vivid that you wouldn&#x27;t think it was a dream, so we came to the wrong assumption... We overlooked the biggest possibility.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> That&#x27;s true... We never were officially told that the training was over.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> We went to discuss this strange situation with Ban Tsugumi here during the day, but failed to meet with her.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> But, then why&#x27;re Miyuki-onee-san and everybody here?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ah... Is it cause I kept on thinking about how I wanted to use magic in my dream!?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I-I did that too!? I was wondering if something fun like magic would happen in our dreams...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Well, that might&#x27;ve had some kind of effect, but we can&#x27;t be sure why they appeared here.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Even if this is a dream, that&#x27;s pretty weird. Do you have any idea why that could&#x27;ve happened?<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> Thinking about this as a dream, the only thing that comes to mind would be, the day before we became lost in this dream, the six of us were staying the night together?<br>
<strong>Miyuki:</strong> If it&#x27;s within a dream, it may be possible. This sort of miraculous meeting too.<br>
<strong>Shizuku:</strong> And, if we wake up from the dream, we should be back in the world we came from. While we&#x27;re on this crazy train of thought, the reason why we came here might not be all that important.<br>
<strong>Mayumi/Kanami:</strong> That&#x27;s it!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> It would be wisest to think up ways to awaken ourselves from the dream then.<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> Yes. It might not be anything more than a small lead to go off of, but it&#x27;s a more definite goal than anything so far.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Thanks, Juujou. From here, we should follow that line of thinking to solve this.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="4-a-way-to-wake-from-the-dream"></a>4: A Way to Wake From the Dream<a class="hash-link" href="#4-a-way-to-wake-from-the-dream" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah, owww!!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> H-Hono-chan!? Why did you bash your head against the wall all of a sudden!?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I thought, if I did this... Maybe I&#x27;d wake up from the dream.<br>
<strong>Miyuki:</strong> Even if it is a dream, it&#x27;s still painful, isn&#x27;t it? I think you&#x27;d better stop, Mihono-san.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I do appreciate your willingness to try anything, but I wouldn&#x27;t reccomend doing that.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Even in a dream... If only Tsugumi-san were here, maybe she could teach us something useful...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> At any rate, our problem is finding a way to wake up out of this. Though, there&#x27;s the possibility that, if we wait long enough, the training will end and Ban Tsugumi will wake us up...<br>
<strong>Shizuku:</strong> It&#x27;s entirely possible that, while we&#x27;ve spent days in this world, only a few hours will have actually passed once we wake up.<br>
<strong>Miyuki:</strong> Your goal with using dreams for training was to create a mock experience of your &quot;ideal self&quot;, wasn&#x27;t it?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah, it was. We were supposed to hold onto an ideal image of ourselves.<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> If that&#x27;s the case, then, if everyone achieves their goal, wouldn&#x27;t you wake up from the dream?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> That does sound plausible. I appreciate it, Shiba-san, Saegusa-san. That&#x27;s some helpful advice.<br>
<strong>Miyuki:</strong> No need to thank us; we only said what came to mind.<br>
<strong>Miyuki:</strong> And, if you all wake up, as we were saying before, we should all be returned home as well.<br>
<strong>Angelina:</strong> Aradama exist in this world, and there are no other magicians besides us.<br>
<strong>Angtelina:</strong> So it should be that this world is based on the toji&#x27;s consciousness, or their dreams. If they wake up, it should disappear.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> The schools and everything are all stuff we know too.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Then, why don&#x27;t we think once more about our &quot;ideal selves&quot;.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Improving your ability to read a situation is not something that can be done in a single day. Though, if you wish to improve in that area, I may be able to help you some.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> What will you do, Yamashiro Yui?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I want to keep all the cute girls safe! If you&#x27;ll teach me how, Mirja-san, I&#x27;ll try as hard as you want me! I hope you&#x27;ll be deep and thorough!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I&#x27;ll teach you even if you don&#x27;t get closer like that. Then, let&#x27;s review the fighting that took place in the mission earlier.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> By the way, what kind of ideal did you think up, Kiyoka?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I was thinking... During missions, I want to do a good job fulfilling my own role; something vague like that. I don&#x27;t have a clear image yet...<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> In that case, why not talk it over with us for a bit? It could provide you hints as to what sort of role would suit you.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...! Thank you very much, Mayumi-san.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Our ideal image of a toji... We were suddenly pulled into the training, so it&#x27;s hard to come up with.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Maybe you don&#x27;t have to worry about it so much. I think you&#x27;re fine staying the way you are now, Hiyori-chan.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Kanami...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> So, help me out, Hiyori-chan! Let&#x27;s have a sparring match straight away! To bring me closer to my ideal self!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> You... just wanted to have a match with me, didn&#x27;t you.<br>
<strong>Erika:</strong> Kanami-. If you&#x27;re looking for a sparring partner, how about me?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Really!?<br>
<strong>Erika:</strong> We both probably have two different concepts of swordfighting. But, I think there&#x27;ll be enough in common.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I&#x27;d love to have you! Erika-san!<br>
<strong>Erika:</strong> That&#x27;s the spirit! Don&#x27;t go holding back on me, okay?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I hope you&#x27;ll get serious too!<br>
<strong>Miyuki:</strong> I&#x27;m sorry about her. Watching you all fight, it seems like Erika has been wanting to test her own strength.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Kanami&#x27;s happy to do it, so it&#x27;s not a problem.<br>
<strong>Miyuki:</strong> Simply coming up with an ideal image of yourself is difficult, isn&#x27;t it. I thought a bit about what I would come up with myself.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...Do you you think you could tell me yours, for reference? Kanami said I&#x27;m fine the way I am, but I have my own thoughts on it.<br>
<strong>Miyuki:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Miyuki:</strong> I have someone who I don&#x27;t want to disappoint, more than any other. I want to be someone that person can be proud of... That&#x27;s what I thought.<br>
<strong>Miyuki:</strong> Ahh!? I&#x27;m sorry... I was supposed to be helping tell you my ideal, but I couldn&#x27;t get it across very well, could I.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Not at all, thanks. I&#x27;m sure that, if there&#x27;s somebody you don&#x27;t want to dissappoint, you&#x27;ll keep putting in effort.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> I&#x27;ll think about it a little.<br>
<strong>Miyuki:</strong> Of course; do what you can, Hiyori-san.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> It&#x27;s been what feels like several days. Even though we tried various things to simulate our ideals, we haven&#x27;t seen any major changes so far.<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> I thought it was a brilliant idea when we came up with it though...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Your line of thinking was probably correct, Saegusa-san. It&#x27;s just that, everyone&#x27;s ideal selves are so disjointed that it&#x27;s slightly difficult understanding how to achieve them all...<br>
<strong>Erika:</strong> Then, in that case, is there any ideal that every toji would work towards?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> An ideal for all toji...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> That&#x27;s it! What Konohana-san said just before we started the training!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> -! The ideal of most toji would be suppressing aradama while keeping casualties to a minimum-- That one, right?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah! What if we worked toward that as our goal?<br>
<strong>Honoka:</strong> I think that&#x27;s a great goal to have.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Then it&#x27;s settled!<br>
<strong>Miyuki:</strong> We&#x27;ll help you as well, in reducing the damage caused by aradama.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Thank you very much. Though it may be a dream, there are still people here who need to be protected. Let&#x27;s carefully work out our strategies and put them into action.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="5-fighting-united-in-a-dream-and-then--"></a>5: Fighting United in a Dream.

Encircle the aradama and do not allow them to escape!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> YAAA!<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> GGGII...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> You&#x27;re really giving it your all, Mihono.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> That&#x27;s cause I&#x27;d hate being stuck in a dream forever.<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> GUOOOOOO...!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Eh!? They came from outside the circle!?<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> It&#x27;s alright, Musumi-san.<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> --Take this!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Saegusa-san, thanks for stopping them with your magic!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> We&#x27;re going to take care of the aradama who freshly appeared! Yomi, stick close to me!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Understood.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ah, Maki-san! Could I go with you too? The number of aradama in the circle is already going down!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Sure. We&#x27;ll sweep through them in one go!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Thanks a lot. I panicked a little.<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> All I did was stop them for a moment by hitting them with dry ice.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It&#x27;s dangerous for you here, Mayumi-san, so please stand back.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I can&#x27;t come up with an ideal image for myself as a toji right away, but I&#x27;m not worried over what I need to do right now.<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> That&#x27;s the spirit. Hang in there.<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> GGGGUUU...!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> More and more are coming.<br>
<strong>Erika:</strong> --HAAAAAAAAAH!<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> ...OOOONNNN.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Chiba Erika!?<br>
<strong>Erika:</strong> It&#x27;s not in me to sit in the back and watch. I&#x27;m here to back you up. Come on, you&#x27;ve gotta finish it off already!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> --YAAAAAAAA!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I understand that you&#x27;re skilled, but be more careful with yourself.<br>
<strong>Erika:</strong> If that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re worried about, then hurry up and beat them. Looks like more are coming.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Fine then. It&#x27;s just a dream. I&#x27;ll overlook it here.<br>
<strong>Shizuku:</strong> Erika couldn&#x27;t resist herself, could she.<br>
<strong>Angelina:</strong> She must have been watching Miyuki and the others spamming out magic to back them up too.<br>
<strong>Honoka:</strong> Aren&#x27;t you going to go in and help too, Lina?<br>
<strong>Angelina:</strong> Asking me that right after that... Aren&#x27;t you making me sound like a person who likes going wild with her magic?<br>
<strong>Honoka:</strong> Ah. S-Sorry... I didn&#x27;t mean it that way!?<br>
<strong>Angelina:</strong> I know. I&#x27;m going to hold off here.<br>
<strong>Shizuku:</strong> In that case, let&#x27;s move further back. It&#x27;d be bad if we got in their way.<br>
<strong>Miyuki:</strong> I won&#x27;t let you do as you please!<br>
<strong>Miyuki:</strong> I&#x27;ve sealed the aradama&#x27;s movements, but it won&#x27;t last long. Please finish them off.<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Leave it to me-.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Wow, Miyuki-onee-san&#x27;s magic seriously froze the aradama rock solid.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Anybody could beat them easy like this-. Though-- It&#x27;s a little boring to me!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> The risks of the mission sure drop way down, handling things this way.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> True. It wouldn&#x27;t be easy to make a reality in the near future... But, surely someday it could be like this.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> In order for that to happen, we&#x27;ll need to put thought into many more things than solely fighting with aradama.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> --Now then, it&#x27;s about time we finished things here.<br>
<strong>Everyone:</strong> Cheers!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I think everyone tried really hard!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> It feels as if we were only able to fight in the ideal manner we&#x27;d one day like to achieve because Shiba Miyuki and the others lent us their strength.<br>
<strong>Miyuki:</strong> I&#x27;m honored you&#x27;d speak so highly of us.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I wonder if we&#x27;ll now wake up in the real world when we sleep tonight.<br>
<strong>Erika:</strong> What&#x27;ll we do if we wake up seeing each other again after we threw this big party?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> If there&#x27;s nothing we can do about our situation... I don&#x27;t want to think about it.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> If it comes to that, it might be better for us to simply leisurely enjoy our time here.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> A lengthy vacation isn&#x27;t something we could easily take, is it?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Then, we should go to the pool or an amusement park!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I&#x27;m going too!<br>
<strong>Miyuki:</strong> I think it&#x27;s wonderful you can all stay so positive. Though, I have a premonition about this.<br>
<strong>Miyuki:</strong> I&#x27;m sure that Onii-sama will be there to wake me in the morning.<br>
<strong>Erika:</strong> Uwah! Now we get a look at how serious Miyuki&#x27;s brother complex is!<br>
<strong>Angelina:</strong> It must feel like it&#x27;s been countless days since she saw Tatsuya, so maybe she&#x27;s going through withdrawals?<br>
<strong>Miyuki:</strong> Honestly, you two. I&#x27;ll get mad. I was speaking seriously.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> You&#x27;re serious, huh...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Though, you know, Ban-san will probably wake us up too. Sooner or later.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Saying that means calling it quits...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah, Kanami. Even though we even had Miyuki-san and them helping us.<br>
<strong>Mayumi:</strong> Dreams are something we all have to wake up from sometime. But, it would be nice if we don&#x27;t forget our meeting.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I agree.<br>
<strong>Shizuku:</strong> I wasn&#x27;t sure how this would go at first though.<br>
<strong>Honoka:</strong> You all really took good care of us, and it was a lot of fun.<br>
<strong>Angelina:</strong> It might be hard meeting again after saying goodbye, but take care.<br>
<strong>Erika:</strong> Wait wait, quit getting all sentimental all of a sudden!<br>
<strong>Erika:</strong> Let&#x27;s eat some good food and live it up. Since we&#x27;re in a dream, we don&#x27;t have to worry about calories either.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I&#x27;m all for what Erika-san&#x27;s saying!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Sure! Here, Hiyori-chan. There&#x27;s a chocolate mint cake too.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Oi, don&#x27;t go making it sound like all I eat is chocolate mint.<br>
<strong>Miyuki:</strong> Fufu. I think I&#x27;ll try some of that chocolate mint as well.<br>
<strong>Miyuki:</strong> (Even if this is goodbye-- I pray that we someday have such a wonderful encounter again.)<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> With this, the test of training making use of dreaming while sleeping has finished. Please remain where you are for a moment. I&#x27;ll come in to get you.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> How was this new form of training, everyone?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I missed you so much, Chii-neeeee!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> M-Mihono-chan!? Hugging me all of a sudden... Did you have a scary dream?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> No. But... I felt a little like I might never see you again.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> You don&#x27;t have to worry. I&#x27;m not going anywhere.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Tsugumi-san. How long were we sleeping for?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Let&#x27;s see, it&#x27;s been a little under four hours now-.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> ...It feels like ten days had already passed in the dream.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I see. It seems I&#x27;ll need to make some improvements in that regard. You&#x27;ve done enough for today, so I would be happy if you&#x27;d submit a report at a later date.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> And, if there&#x27;s any concerns you have, please go right ahead and ask.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> It was kinda fun though, wasn&#x27;t it-.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> It was. Though, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll be able to sleep tonight.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Do you think Miyuki-san and them were really there?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> There&#x27;s no way for us to be sure. But, I think it was a valuable experience.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah. They were all such good people, and they helped us suppress the aradama without anyone getting hurt.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> It&#x27;d be nice if someday we&#x27;ll be able to carry out missions as safely as that.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations/edit/docs/Mahouka:_Dream_Visitors.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_2_ui" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_3DPF"></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"></div></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_35-E thin-scrollbar"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#countdown-sleepover-part-1" class="table-of-contents__link">Countdown: Sleepover Part 1</a></li><li><a href="#countdown-sleepover-part-2" class="table-of-contents__link">Countdown: Sleepover Part 2</a></li><li><a href="#1-the-ultimate-image-training" class="table-of-contents__link">1: The Ultimate Image Training</a></li><li><a href="#2-strange-visitors" class="table-of-contents__link">2: Strange Visitors</a></li><li><a href="#3-something-off-in-this-world" class="table-of-contents__link">3: Something Off in this World</a></li><li><a href="#4-a-way-to-wake-from-the-dream" class="table-of-contents__link">4: A Way to Wake From the Dream</a></li><li><a href="#5-fighting-united-in-a-dream-and-then--" class="table-of-contents__link">5: Fighting United in a Dream.
