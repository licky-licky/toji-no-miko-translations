They're looking excited, aren't they?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Well yeah. Exams just finished, and it'll be Christmas soon. They're all getting into it.<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Ne-!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Awww~...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> What's with you? Normally you'd be all "Christmas!" and dancing around.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Christmas is the problem! Hear me out, Kaoru.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> This year, everyone in my family has some other important business stopping them from getting together on the 25th...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> This was my chance to be with everyone, and I was really looking forward to it.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Aww... Now I'll be spending Christmas all by myself.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Fine, since it's Christmas, I'll celebrate with you. Though it sounds like a lot of effort.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Kaoru...! Friends have to stick together, right! We should start getting things ready for Christmas right now!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> But I'm tired.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Come on, let's go!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> O-Oi, you don't have to pull so hard.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> First off, we should think of where to order the cake from.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Ah, for the main course, instead of chicken, why don't we do it like in America and roast a turkey?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> The two of us aren't gonna be able to finish a whole turkey...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I just can't wait to spend Christmas with you, Kaoru.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> That's my phone... I don't want to answer.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Is it Sana-sensei? If you don't, it'll be worse later.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Fine... Hello?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Huhh? Hang on! I only just got back here!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> What's wrong? Kaoru?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> I'll be on expedition duty Christmas day... Ughh.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> But... What about getting ready for our fun Christmas together!?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> I can help you get ready for a lonely Christmas at least... I can't believe how hard they're overworking us...<br><strong>???:</strong> Ughhhh... Why is this happening to me.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Come on, Kaoru. No matter how bad things are, don't you think you're laying it on too thick?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> That wasn't me just now.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Then, who...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ......<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> That one.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Yep, there's no mistaking that gloomy face.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Should we talk to her?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Let's do it!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Oiii, what's wrong? You look upset about something.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Oh, Ellen-san, Kaoru-san.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I can't help but worry when I see you looking depressed, MihoMiho.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Well... You see...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I failed my exams... When I think about how the winter break I've been waiting on is gonna be filled with makeup classes and more exams, I can't help but be depressed...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> That sounds pretty...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> ...Heavy, huh.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> This'll be my saddest winter break ever...!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> I know how you feel... We should get to decide how to spend our own break!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Instead of a white Christmas, it's looking like we'll all be having a black Christmas...<br><strong>Passing Toji A:</strong> Isn't Christmas coming up? Do you have any plans?<br><strong>Passing Toji B:</strong> Ahaha, of course I don't.<br><strong>Passing Toji A:</strong> Then, have you heard about that Five Traditions Unified Christmas Mock Battle they're doing on Christmas Eve?<br><strong>Passing Toji A:</strong> The one where the winner gets a reward from the head of the family.<br><strong>Passing Toji B:</strong> Nobody told me. What reward?<br><strong>Passing Toji A:</strong> They're saying you can wish for anything, and the head of the family will make it happen.<br><strong>Passing Toji B:</strong> Seriously!? That's Yukari-sama for you, I guess. I'll think about it.<br><strong>Mihono &amp; Ellen:</strong> ...!?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I'm going to ask for more information! You two just wait right here-!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> If what they were saying is true... Then there's still hope!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Well, nobody wants to spend Christmas studying.  </p><h2 id="2-unified-christmas-mock-battle" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>2: Unified Christmas Mock Battle</h2><p><strong>Ellen:</strong> Getting right to it, both the Five Traditions Unified Christmas Mock Battle and Yukari-sama granting any wish are real!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> That's crazy!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> It's just limited to anything Yukari-sama can make happen.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> But that means Yukari-sama could cancel out my failing grades and makeup classes, right!?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> That's what it means. Yukari-sama's so generous.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Then I might be able to win back my fun filled winter break... Probably!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> That's the spirit, MihoMiho!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I should tell Chii-nee and the others about the mock battle!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I think they're going to officially announce it soon.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Oh, okay. So what are we supposed to do to win, anyway?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> They said they're going to announce that on the day of the mock battle.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> If they're granting any wish, there's going to be a lot of people getting worked up over it.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> That's right, that's why I need you getting worked up over it too, Kaoru!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Sure.<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Nene-!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> We might both end up rivals in the mock battle, but let's both do our best to get that Christmas present, MihoMiho!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I'm not planning on losing!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Chew chew... Your cookies are always good. I like them.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I'll make more for you. Oh right, why don't we hold a Christmas party together? I can make you more than just cookies.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm... I'll look forward to spending Christmas together.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> But... I can't help you get ready for the party.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> You didn't have to worry about that, but why?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> The day before Christmas, there's going to be a unified mock battle. President Takatsu told me to win it.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I have friends who are joining that too. The winner is supposed to get their wish granted by Yukari-sama.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I know you're strong, Sayaka-chan, but don't push yourself too hard.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm. If I got hurt, I wouldn't be able to spend Christmas with you. I'll be careful.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Okay, please do. So then, do you know what you want to wish for?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> The president only told me to fight. It's like a mission.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Hmm... You should think up something, in case you win.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Something you want, or want to try doing.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I'll think about it. Thank you, Mai.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> You don't have to thank me. But if there's anything you want from me, just ask, okay?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I want another cookie.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> In that case... Here, say "ahhh".<br><strong>Maki:</strong> This Five Traditions Unified Mock Battle we're holding... It could be a good chance for toji to improve their technique and sense of awareness.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> But, I don't think there'll be a winner.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I agree. Considering the victory condition, it's very difficult.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> We'll have to do everything we can to make sure this mock battle goes off without a hitch.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes.<br>And now, the 24th of December. The day of the Five Traditions Unified Christmas Mock Battle has arrived.</p><h2 id="3-an-out-of-place-christmas-tree" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>3: An Out of Place Christmas Tree</h2><p><strong>Maki:</strong> Silence-! Yukari-sama is about to explain the purpose of today's mock battle. Please, go ahead.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> To begin with, I want to apologize for making this announcement so shortly before the event begins.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> To all of you students, tomorrow you will be entering your winter break, sure to be a time of festivities as we enter the new year.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> However, for all of you toji, I would like for you to once more engrave your duty deeper into your minds. To that end, I have hosted this Five Traditions Unified Christmas Mock Battle.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Though, I don't mean to be so strict with you today. I promise that, whoever can come out the victor of this mock battle, I will grant any wish I can make possible.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Basically, that makes Yukari-sama your Santa Claus this year~!<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> ...Indeed, though my clothes aren't nearly as red, and I have hardly as many presents to reward you with.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> That will be all from me. There are those among you who won't participate in this assignment, but I hope you feel mutually encouraged by those aiming for victory.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Now then, I'll be going over the rules and victory condition.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> First, to explain how we will decide the victor, I'd like for you all to look at the top of this tree.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Do you see the star mounted on top? Whoever can take that star will be our winner.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> So there was a practical reason for that big tree.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I just thought it was there to look pretty.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> You can defeat your rival toji first, or aim right for that shining star.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> But, those rivals won't be your only obstacle. Protecting that star will be--<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Hiii, it's me and Suzuka onee-san!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yume, Maki-san was in the middle of her explanation.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ehhh, but she was just gonna introduce us, so what's the difference?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Sigh... Maki-san, please continue.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Putting it simply... If you can't pass the defenses of the second and fourth seat of the elite guard, you won't be getting that star.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> And as far as time goes, you have until 10pm to accomplish that. That does it, as far as basic rules go.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> In addition, I will go over responding to any aradama that appear during the mock battle.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> In the case of an aradama's appearance, dealing with it will be our top priority. Of course, taking the star at that point will not count.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Please do not forget your duty as toji.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Then, Suzuka, Yume.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Starting now, the Five Traditions Unified Christmas Mock Battle will begin-!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> All of you can come at once, you don't have to be shy you know-?<br><strong>Ordinary Toji A:</strong> They might be the elite guard, but there's only two of them... If we all rush them, someone will be able to break through for sure!<br><strong>Ordinary Toji B:</strong> We don't have to beat them either... So long as one of us can grab that star--<br><strong>Ordinary Toji C:</strong> Let's all go together-!!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Too easy. I can't even call that a warmup~. If that's all you've got, you're just gonna annoy me making me fight you.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> You shouldn't speak to them like that. This is an exercise in improving their technique. You need to face them as proper opponents<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Fineee. You can take a break, you know, Suzuka onee-san.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Fufu, I'm afraid I can't accept that offer, but I'd welcome seeing you try your best, Yume.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Nobody said I was gonna have to fight the elite guard for this!?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Considering the reward, I expected as much...<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I've confirmed the victory condition... I'll secure the star now.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Hang on, Sayaka-chan. Why don't we wait and see how things play out first?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Understood. I know I can rely on you at times like this, Mai.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Hmmm~, looks like we're really going to have to work to make this happen. But, so long as you're here Kaoru, I know we can do it!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> I'm really losing interest in this whole wish granting thing though. It suddenly became a pain in the ass... Ahh, I could be eating kanpyo rolls under a kotatsu right about now.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Just forget about everything else, and let's challenge ourselves a little!<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Ne-ne! Ne-ne!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Alright, you win, but just a little.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Now then. How do we go about getting past Yumecchi and HanaHana...  </p><h2 id="4-the-distant-star" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>4: The Distant Star</h2><p><strong>Mock Battle Participant A:</strong> Kyaa...!?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> You're all being far too careless.<br><strong>Mock Battle Participant B:</strong> Wait... When did she-!?<br><strong>Mock Battle Participant C:</strong> How are they this strong...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> No matter how many you bring, you won't reach the tree without a proper plan.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Aww, I thought I was gonna get to play with those onee-sans!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> You were dealing with another group, weren't you, Yume?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I wanted to count how many I could play with at the same time.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Why exactly do you think we're here...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> The elite guard might be a huge wall in the way, but I'm not about to give up on Christmas and winter break... Mmmm, what do I do...?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> It's true... Those two are unbelievably strong. But you don't have to defeat them. You only have to worry about getting the star from the tree.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Oh yeah! If I don't have to beat them... Then getting out of makeup classes isn't just a dream!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> That's right... With the right strategy, you might still win. Though, I'd be okay with helping you study for your exams, you know?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> If I can help it... I don't want to study!!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Honestly, as your onee-san, I'd rather you studied instead. But I promised I'd help you with this.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> We'll just have to put our heads together and figure out how to get that star. "Where there's a will, there's a way", right?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah! Where there's a will, there's a way...!!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> That's my Mihono-chan.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> So you two were doing all that yelling. A will and a way's not gonna help you beat the elite guard.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I know, but... Then you help too, Fukki!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Don't wanna. Call me when there's aradama-chan to fight instead of toji.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> But I think if you helped us, our chances of winning would be much higher, Kofuki-chan.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> I'm on standby. You guys can handle that mock battle yourselves.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Besides, Chichie, you baby Mihocchi way too much. I mean come on, her wish is getting out of makeup classes...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Ughh!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> You might be right, Kofuki-chan.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Chii-nee.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> But even so, if Mihono-chan is in trouble, I want to be there to help her. I'm her onee-san, after all.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Chii-nee!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> O-Oh... Mihono-chan... When you hug me like that... It's a little awkward.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Ehehe. I made up my mind, there's no way I'm not getting that star!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Fighting those two directly will be tough, but I'll try to give you an opening.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...Whatever, I won't be a third wheel. Ahh, when are there gonna be some aradama-chan around here.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> The star feels so so high up and far away.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> I thought that Yume was obsessed with fighting, but even after teasing her she won't move away...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> And even if you did, HanaHana's still there.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> But still, we can't just keep hiding back here. Let's go get a close up look at the enemy!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> I'll give it a shot.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ahaha! You came out of nowhere, right from my blind spot! That's more like it!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> You're going to hurt my feelings, acting so casual about my surprise attack~<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> D'yaaah!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> At last, some opponents worth fighting have arrived.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Though, doesn't that okatana give you trouble in close quarters?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Well, that much is obvious. But it doesn't matter.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I see, so you're betting on her to win then?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Yes, I'm here to take your star!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Nooope, I won't let you do that, Onee-san-!!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Haaaah-! I'll send you flying-!!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Oh...! Combining that move with hachimanriki! Nice, Yumecchi!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Fufu~, seeya next time, Onee-san~!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Alright, time to retreat.<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Nene!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> ...Huh!?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> She launched you pretty far. You okay?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I'm fine, thank you. I like when you get worried, Kaoru.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> So, what do you think?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> They made some changes to the way they fought against us.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Yumecchi's speed is an issue, but it seems like they're fighting to keep us away from the tree.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> If they can't beat someone in one hit and a long fight breaks out, it must get a lot harder protecting the star.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> So it probably makes their job easiest if they keep using hachimanriki to bounce us away.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Feels like Yumecchi is on top of her game today. This could be a real piece of work.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Geez-! Why'd they run after I only knocked her away one time-! That's so boring!  </p><h2 id="5-various-desires" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>5: Various Desires</h2><p><strong>Yume:</strong> Sayaka-chan, play~ with~ me~!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Sorry, I'll be your opponent instead!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Nn~, then I'll leave Sayaka-chan for later. How long do you think you can keep up with me, Onee-san?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> If you're challenging me too, then I'll face you the same as the others.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Fighting you isn't my goal. So...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Well, of course it wouldn't be. But--<br><strong>Mai:</strong> In the middle of our fighting, I tried to lead Tsubakuro-san away from the tree. But it was no use.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Tsubakuro Yume moved a little away. It wasn't a bad plan, Mai.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I think Konohana-san... No, Tsubakuro-san too, they realized what we were doing. If I were on the defending team, it would never be a good idea to move far from the tree.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Maybe we should have tried a more direct offense before.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> We won't be able to take the star that easily.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> That reminds me, Sayaka-chan. Have you decided what you'll wish for when you get the star yet?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I forgot to think about it. My wish... What I want to do, what I want.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> That's right. Yukari-sama seems like she would be able to make anything possible.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...I thought of it... I want to eat Mai's cookies.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> But Yukari-sama could ask a high class bakery to make you some delicious sweets. Why not ask for that?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> No, I want yours. When I think about getting to eat the tasty cookies Mai made, I feel like I can work even harder.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> In that case, I'll bake you the most delicious cookies I've ever made, I promise.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm, I want to try that.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> But, to get that star, we can't just fight those two.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> That's right. Why don't we look for an opportunity as we see how they move to intercept? We're sure to find an opening somewhere.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Hm?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> What is it? Mai?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Tsubakuro-san, she left the tree? What are they planning... A trap?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Come onnn, nobody strong is showing up! This is too boring! Ever since the start, we've only been getting weaklings!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> You knew this would happen, though. There are few toji capable of entertaining you out there.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Well there was Sayaka-chan and some others, but they won't fight me for real.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> They seem to be coming up with their own plans.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I got it! Since I'm bored, I'll see if Maki onee-san will play with me!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I supposed this might happen. I'll handle things while you're gone.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Hey, hey, fight me, Maki onee-san! I was about to die of boredom over there~.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> You know we can't do that now. You and I both have our duties here.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Boo. You just have to stay near Yukari-sama!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ah! I just thought of something good. Yukari-sama~? If I can protect the star, I want you to grant my wish!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> That's already an important role Yukari-sama gave you. Don't start acting greedy with it.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> No, if that will keep Yume motivated, I'll allow it. If you can keep the star untouched, I'll grant your wish.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> You mean it!? Hooray-! I wonder what I should wish for~?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Wasn't that nice of her, Tsubakuro-san.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Yeah! It's my Christmas present~, my Christmas present~!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> (Come to think of it, doesn't something happen around Christmas?)<br><strong>Yume:</strong> ...Ah! It's Yomi onee-san's...!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> (Yomi onee-san's birthday! I remember hearing it's on Christmas Eve!)<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> My... What?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> It's nothing, nothing at all-!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> (I'll make Yomi onee-san all surprised by giving her a birthday present out of nowhere~!)<br><strong>Yume:</strong> (What should I get for her~. What would make Yomi onee-san happy...)<br><strong>Yume:</strong> !!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Hey, hey, Yomi onee-san, you love rice, right? You were eating a lot of rice balls the other day.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ...Yes. Though, why are you asking?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> No reason, I just remembered is all.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ......<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I should get back to the tree now! Nobody's gonna get that star from me, just you watch~.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> Yume is looking especially motivated now.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> You made the right call, Yukari-sama.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes. Now it will be harder than ever for those participating to take that star.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> We can't say for sure how things will end. Let's watch as the toji show us how they've grown.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> No matter how many times you try, it's gonna be the same, you know~? I won't go easy on you.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> You seem to be rather excited about your work now. Did something happen?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Yukari-sama promised me, if I can keep the star from getting taken, she'll grant my wish too~!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Then I'll need to do my best to make sure your wish comes true, Yume.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Thanks, Suzuka onee-san!  </p><h2 id="6-christmas-memories" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>6: Christmas Memories</h2><p><strong>Chie:</strong> Now's your chance, Mihono-chan!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Okay!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Are you thinking you can take me cause Suzuka onee-san's busy with other people? That's a little disappointing.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> I'm not taking you lightly. But you can't win without risking it!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> No matter who you are, I won't be allowing you through.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...So fast! Even though she already had her hands full.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> I won't let you stop her-!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> You can't go getting distracted like that, Onee-san.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Eh?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Chii-nee!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Phew... I made it!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ooh, that was a pretty good move! I wasn't expecting you to step in~.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Chii-nee... Let's get out of here for now!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Ah...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I grabbed your hand pretty hard back there. Was I too rough?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> ...You didn't hurt me at all.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> You know, I'm sorry I dragged you into this on Christmas Eve, Chii-nee...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Tsubakuro-san and Konohana-san were on us in a second. It put me in a cold sweat...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> No, thank you for saving me. I'm supposed to be your onee-san... But I'm no help.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> What are you saying, Chii-nee? You're always helping me out.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Thank you. Maybe it's because of how you took my hand then, but you reminded me of when we were kids.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Did something like this happen before?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> I was about to start crying, and... You came straight over and led me away by the hand. It was just like this; you were a real hero of justice.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I was? I think I remember something like that, but...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> But still, lately you really feel like an onee-san, Chii-nee. You're nothing like you used to be. And you help me out all the time.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> It makes me happy to hear you say that, Mihono-chan. I mean it.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> You know, now that we're thinking back, remember that time when you were in elementary school and we had a Christmas party at your house?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> I do. And I remember you were so excited that you dropped your cake on the floor. You got so upset over it.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> W-Well I was just a kid back then...!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> But then, you cut your cake in half and gave me some.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> I think I was trying to act a little more like your onee-san.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> You keep running into trouble, Mihono-chan, so I want to be there more for you to rely on me.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Besides, Christmas cake doesn't taste as good when you're eating it by yourself, right?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah! It was only half, but I remember it being really yummy.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Look at us, getting lost in the past. Why don't we come back to the present and think about how we're going to get that star down?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> I want to spend another good Christmas with you this year, after all.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> For sure! I'm counting on you, Chii-nee!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> You can help think too, Mihono-chan.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Because the members of the elite guard protecting the tree are stronger than expected, there are less and less toji trying for the star. Meanwhile, it's becoming easier for them to guard it.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> In short, I think many people have given up already.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Maybe that's why. Konohana-san worked through the people she was already fighting quicker than I thought, so...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> But, I also think it's a good thing there are less rivals now.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I see you still haven't given up, MihoMiho. If only Kaoru could learn from that side of you.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Does that mean Kaoru-san quit already?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Unfortunately, yes. It sounds like she's too tired from being on so many expeditions.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> She must have been on a lot...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Oh, you're here, Ellen-chan.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I was waiting for you, MaiMai, Saaya.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Ellen, what did you want to talk about?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Huh? What's going on?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Fufufu~  </p><h2 id="7-until-you-get-the-toji-star" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>7: Until You Get the Toji Star!</h2><p><strong>Ellen:</strong> We're holding a combined strategy meeting to settle this once and for all!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ooh!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> To start with, why don't we all share what happened the times we tried getting that star?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> When Kaoru and I made our move, I was going to use jin'i and hachimanriki to reach the top, but Yumecchi saw it coming.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Kaoru was keeping HanaHana busy at the time. How did things go for you when you went up against those two?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> You can be sure that if you take your attention off them for a moment, they'll be closing in.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> If Mihono-chan wasn't there to protect me... I'm sure Tsubakuro-san would have taken me out.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> How about you, MaiMai?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Konohana-san keeps a close eye on Tsubakuro-san, and is always ready to follow up and coordinate with her.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> It's hard to take the star while being Tsubakuro Yume's opponent. You don't get to focus on anything else.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> You're right about that. It feels like to push through their defense, I'd need another helping hand or two.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> The time limit is also approaching.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Then it sounds like we need to have everyone here fighting together?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> That's a nice idea, but everyone here wants the star for themselves, right?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Oh yeah.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> That's going to make everyone joining forces sort of difficult.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> That's true. I don't have a wish of my own, but I promised Mihono-chan I would help her with hers.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I'm sort of the same way.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> If we try our hardest, I'm sure things will turn out for the best for one of us.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Let's all work hard and not worry about who's going to win!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Fufu~. It's looking like I'll be the one getting the star after all.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> You shouldn't have said that, Yume. Now they're here.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Hyaah-!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I'll play with both of you at once!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I'm going to take the star.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> While they attack from the front, we'll move in from the other side.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> You didn't think it would be that easy, did you?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Mihono-chan, I've got this... And Tsubakuro-san is also...!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Thanks, Chii-nee!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I'm more than capable of handling the two of you as well.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> (Everyone's started making their moves.)<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> (Even though we said we wouldn't work together, attacking in waves would be the most effective option.)<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> (Hmm, Yumecchi should be better for this than HanaHana.)<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> If only Kaoru were here, I could calm down and enjoy myself some more.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Yumecchi! Don't you want to play with me?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Hmph... I'm a little busy playing with Sayaka-chan and this other onee-san right now, so come back later!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> But that's no good; I want to play with you now.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I told you, go away!!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Sayaka-chan!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> !<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Don't go anywhere, Sayaka-chan! I'll deal with this onee-san later... Haaah-!!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> ......<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> (She's grinning? To begin with, why would she come to take Yume's attack head on like that?)<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> (That's right... When she fought her last time, Yume used hachimanriki like this to knock her... Ah!)<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> You can't do that... Yume! If you hit her away--<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Huh?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Just like I wanted, thanks a bunch!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> If I bounce up the tree with some help from hachimanriki, the star's right in my reach.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Kohagura Ellen's got the star in her hands!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> She actually used the kickback from being struck by Tsubakuro-san...<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Ellen's amazing.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Awww... I don't believe it.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> That's not fair, big boobie onee-san!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Ooph! It's perfectly fair. I put all my faith in how strong you are, Yumeechi!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> The winner is Kohagura Ellen.

I wanted those cookies, but I had fun fighting with you, Mai.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Fufu, don't worry. I'll still make you cookies and a cake for Christmas.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I know it isn't much compared to Yukari-sama granting you anything. But it's my Christmas present to you for trying so hard, Sayaka-chan.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I'm excited for tomorrow.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Boo. We almost made it...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> She did find a clever way to win, but it's frustrating nonetheless.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I think you two fought well.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> But I wanted to ask Yukari-sama to give Yomi onee-san a year's worth of Akita rice for her birthday present-!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> ...Yume.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> So that's what you were thinking about.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> I just wanted to give her a present.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> It would be difficult to accept a year's worth, but thank you, Tsubakuro-san.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> You don't have to thank me, I couldn't even get you anything.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> That's not true... I'll make you some kiritanpo to eat, Tsubakuro-san.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Kiritanpo on Christmas? Ahaha, that's really weird-!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> If there's a kind of rice you like, please tell me. If not, I will choose a rice from Akita.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Yo, winner.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Where have you been all this time?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> So, what are you gonna wish for?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> For Yukari-sama to give you a vacation on Christmas. That's all I want!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> You can think of it as my Christmas present to you.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Huhh? You're the one who won. Use it for yourself.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> You could have just accepted it. But I love when you're considerate like that, Kaoru.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> I'm just stating the obvious. Come on, isn't there anything else you want?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Hmmm... Let's see. I only want to spend a nice Christmas together with you, so...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> ! I just had a good idea!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I'll ask for a Five Traditions Unified Christmas Party. That way, everyone can have a good time together!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Why not, it sounds like fun.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Is that okay, Yukari-sama?<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> A Unified Christmas Party? It's short notice, but that won't be a problem. I'll begin the preparations.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> The elite guard will take charge of responding to any aradama incidents that may happen tomorrow.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> No matter what aradama show up, you know I'm enough to beat them alone, Yukari-sama.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> We'll do as you order, Yukari-sama. The elite guard doesn't object.<br><strong>Yukari:</strong> With that settled, tomorrow we will host the Five Traditions Unified Christmas Party.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Kaoru gets the day off, and we get to spend Christmas together. It's two birds with one stone!<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Ne-!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Normally in America we spend it with our families, but I heard in Japan you spend it with the person you love, so this year I'll try a Japanese style Christmas!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Because you're the person I love, Kaoru!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Uh, when they say that, it's actually supposed to be more like a romantic thing... ...Well, fine. I get the day off, so I'll go along with it.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> It sounds like Yukari-sama is hosting a Christmas party instead.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> If Mai's going, I'll go too.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ......<br><strong>Chie:</strong> There's going to be a big Christmas party, Mihono-chan. So cheer up.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> The party sounds like fun, but... Makeup classes won't be.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> I can't go to class for you, but I'll be right there helping you get ready for your exams.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> That way, you should still be able to find some time to have fun over the break, right?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> So let's forget about that for now and enjoy tomorrow's party, okay?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> WAAAAHH! I'm so lucky I have you, Chii-nee... No, you're all I have left, Chii-neeee!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Oh... You're exaggerating, Mihono-chan. There, there.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Looks like you made the right call with the party.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Fufu, I'm glad you think so.
