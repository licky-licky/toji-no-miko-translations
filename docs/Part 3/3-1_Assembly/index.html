<strong>Kofuki:</strong> What&#x27;s with you, Mihocchi? Don&#x27;t laugh for no reason like that, it&#x27;s creepy. Did you eat something off the floor again?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Kofuki-san, it isn&#x27;t creepy in the slightest! Isn&#x27;t it cute, isn&#x27;t she lovable, don&#x27;t you have to fight the urge to hug her tight when you see that angelic smile!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ahaha, uh... Well. I was just thinking, we&#x27;re all pretty awesome aren&#x27;t we, and I started laughing, I guess?<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> Are you including me in there too? Did I do anything that impressive?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I mean, all of us went to the netherworld, and we fought that great aradama, and we brought back Tsubakuro-san! That&#x27;s all amazing, right?<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> Yeah, I can&#x27;t deny that. Though with those two from the elite guard helping, I think anyone could have gotten through there.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Even without them around, it would&#x27;ve been no problem for us.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I&#x27;m just glad we were able to get Tsubakuro-san back safely.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> .........<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah, I&#x27;m sorry...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> You didn&#x27;t say anything wrong, Kiyoka-chan.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> But still, it feels like... I&#x27;m sorry...<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Are you still doing this? You haven&#x27;t gotten over helping save Tsubakuro Yume yet?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> You know what that girl did to everyone in Mokusa! Of course I wouldn&#x27;t get over it that easily!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Chii-nee...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> ...I&#x27;m sorry. Let me go collect my thoughts for a while.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Seriously...<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> But if I were put in Chie-san&#x27;s position, I&#x27;d have a hard time accepting this too. At least, after what Tsubakuro-san did.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I can fully imagine how Setouchi Chie is feeling. However, Tsubakuro Yume&#x27;s strength is vital to us now.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Regardless of the circumstances that brought us here, she is an indispensable ally to have.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ......She&#x27;ll be fine. I know Chii-nee will get through this.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> It feels so much better having Yume back. I could never express my gratitude to those girls.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> And more than anything, Suzuka. Thank you for staying at my side.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I felt the same as you did about rescuing Yume. You don&#x27;t need to thank me.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Now if only Yomi-san would come back, the elite guard could all be together again.<br>
<strong>Akane:</strong> Ah, you were in here.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Akane-sama...? Did you need us for something?<br>
<strong>Akane:</strong> I didn&#x27;t want to distract you from the operation by mentioning this earlier, but there&#x27;s something I should tell you two.<br>
<strong>Akane:</strong> In actuality, along with Ichikishimahime on this ship, my sister, Origami Yukari, is here as well.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Yukari-sama is here!?  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="2-mother"></a>2: Mother<a class="hash-link" href="#2-mother" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> So the Origami Yukari who was supposed to be recovering in a hospital was hiding in an armed submarine.<br>
<strong>Akane:</strong> This submarine is fully equipped with medical facilities, so I wasn&#x27;t exactly lying.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Yukari-sama&#x27;s not an aradama anymore, right?<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Yes, that&#x27;s right.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> I&#x27;m not so sure.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> For twenty years, she was Tagitsuhime. They said you separated, but I&#x27;m not buying it that easily.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> And even if you are just an ordinary person again, can you say for sure you aren&#x27;t being manipulated?<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> I can do nothing but ask you to believe me. Juujou, do you still consider me unforgivable?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> From the moment the great aradama possessed you twenty years ago, until the day she passed away, my mother lamented everything. If you think I&#x27;ll forgive you now...!<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Juujou, Etou, I&#x27;m sorry.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Twenty years ago, on the day of the disaster, I was in charge of the special unit and oversaw the final battle your mothers were a part of.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> My duty was to force Tagitsuhime, who was clinging to our world, back to the netherworld, and seal the opening.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> In doing so, Kagari... Juujou&#x27;s mother, would fall with Tagitsuhime to the bottom of the netherworld and diffuse into nothing.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> However, Tagitsuhime sought way to avoid annihilation. In exchange for saving your mother&#x27;s lives, it proposed to assimilate with me.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> To avoid losing my friends, I took in the aradama who had left thousands of victims...<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> I&#x27;m sure you know the rest. Etou and Juujou&#x27;s mothers, Minato and Kagari, I failed to save them both, and I alone was left alive.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> You know, my mother seemed happy until she died. I guess &quot;until she died&quot; is a weird way of putting that though.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> She taught me all about swordfighting too, so I think she was proud of her time as a toji.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Your mother was...?<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> I see... And Shidou, Konohana. Good work on your recovery of Tsubakuro.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Right...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Though, without the help of Kitora-san and Asakura-san here, as well as their companions, our recovery of Yume would never have been possible.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Asakura? Where have I... And that okatana, Kashuu Kiyomitsu... No... Could it be coincidence?<br>
<strong>Akane:</strong> It isn&#x27;t, actually. I was curious and looked into her myself.<br>
<strong>Akane:</strong> This girl&#x27;s mother was Asakura Hikari. She was one of the toji who joined in the fight during the disaster.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Looking closer, I can see the resemblance.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Eh!? You knew my mom?<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Yes... She was a very impressive toji.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Impressive?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> (Huhh... That&#x27;s weird? They told me, even though she was chosen by Kashuu Kiyomitsu, she was so useless you wouldn&#x27;t believe it though...)<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> It&#x27;s too much for this to be chance. In which case, is it the will of Kashuu Kiyomitsu?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Umm, what are you talking about?<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> The time may come that you one day understand. For the sake of that day, become as strong as you can be. Continue marching forward, never neglecting your training.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Asakura Mihono, I will remember that name. I have high expectations of your progress.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Th-Thank you very much!<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> The girl chosen by Kashuu Kiyomitsu... Is this fate as well?  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="3-what-a-toji-should-do-1"></a>3: What a Toji Should Do (1)<a class="hash-link" href="#3-what-a-toji-should-do-1" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> Nnn~, I can&#x27;t get her out of my head.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> What&#x27;s that, there&#x27;s someone you&#x27;re interested in? If it&#x27;s me, you know you&#x27;re always welcome!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Eh- Hono-chan&#x27;s interested in someone!? Who is it? Do I know them!?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I didn&#x27;t say anything like that! How&#x27;d you get that confused?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Oh, that&#x27;s not it...?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Come on, you know someone as straightforward as Mihocchi could never be thinking about romance.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I don&#x27;t wanna hear it from you, Fukki.<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> So who&#x27;s on your mind then...?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> It&#x27;s Yukari-sama. I can&#x27;t stop thinking about what she told me.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I mean, it sounded really important, but she never told me anything else.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> It&#x27;s true it seemed significant, but don&#x27;t tell me you&#x27;ve been stuck on that all this time? It&#x27;s been three days since we spoke to her.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> But it&#x27;s bugging me!ã€€Aggh~, it&#x27;s driving me nuts. Maybe I should just go ask her!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I&#x27;m afraid that won&#x27;t be possible. To avoid the possibility of an attack from Tagitsuhime, the submarine has already left the coast.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Don&#x27;t tell me that~! What am I supposed to do about how messed up I&#x27;m feeling then!?<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> Why not try distracting yourself with your duties? There&#x27;s always aradama to be dealt with.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Our duties... But what exactly will we be doing from now on?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> We lost Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu, but Yukari Sama is in good health, and Tsubakuro-san was saved... What&#x27;s going to happen with our investigation team?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> We should--<br>
<strong>Announcement:</strong> Aradama have appeared in the city. Toji should move to intercept at once. I repeat--<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Nice timing, just when this was getting boring! I love you, my aradama-chan!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Fiiine, I&#x27;ll blow away all this frustration!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="4-what-a-toji-should-do-2"></a>4: What a Toji Should Do (2)<a class="hash-link" href="#4-what-a-toji-should-do-2" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ahh~, much better!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Are you feeling better about what Yukari-sama said now?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Well it&#x27;s not like I can do anything about it, so there&#x27;s no point thinking about it. I think I&#x27;ll be fine like this.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> That&#x27;s a musclebrain for you; she already forgot about it.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> And again, I don&#x27;t wanna hear it from you, Fukki!<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> What&#x27;s most important is we managed to get here and deal with the aradama before they could cause a lot of damage.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> We make the best team, don&#x27;t we!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I&#x27;m feeling a little relieved too. I don&#x27;t know what will happen to our team, but I&#x27;m sure what I need to do won&#x27;t change.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> We&#x27;ll keep protecting everyone from aradama. That&#x27;s what really matters, isn&#x27;t it?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Whatever the circumstances, we are still toji. We take up okatana to exorcise and suppress aradama.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Even if we manage to suppress the great aradama Tagitsuhime, noro won&#x27;t simply vanish.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Our fight against aradama will continue regardless. Whatever reason we end up fighting for, so long as we don&#x27;t lose sight of that, our path will always be clear.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I understand.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> That&#x27;s so stupid. Were you really worried about that? We&#x27;re toji, so we cut up aradama. That&#x27;s all you have to care about.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Not everybody&#x27;s as simple as you, Kofuki-san.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> You... Did you just call me simple!? You sure started talking big for someone who used to be too shy to say anything.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> And you too... How long&#x27;re you gonna be all moody for, Chichie? Don&#x27;t you think you&#x27;re overthinking things too?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> ...Maybe you&#x27;re right.<br>

It&#x27;s like Kofuki-chan said. I&#x27;m only bringing everyone down.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> I know we have no choice but to work together, but I just can&#x27;t forgive Tsubakuro-san after all. I&#x27;m not a very good onee-chan, am I.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> No, I get it... I know how you feel, Chii-nee.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Looking back on it, I was the same with Mirja-san. I was too stubborn to let go of my suspicions of her...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Here I was thinking I&#x27;d become a little more of an adult, but with how carried away I get with my feelings, it&#x27;s like I&#x27;m still a child.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> If somebody hurt the people close to me, I wouldn&#x27;t forgive them either.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I think there&#x27;s some things people just can&#x27;t give up on. It doesn&#x27;t have to make sense, but that&#x27;s okay.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> ...Thank you, Mihono-chan.<br>
<strong>Announcement:</strong> Aradama have appeared in the residential area. Toji should move to intercept at once. I repeat--<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Phew... Now then, it&#x27;s time we did our duty as toji, isn&#x27;t it?<br>

<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Felt like those aradama-chan weren&#x27;t even fighting back. I hope we get to go up against something bigger next time.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Eh... I&#x27;m fine with them being this weak...<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> Hang on, Kiyoka-san. Weren&#x27;t you just saying you&#x27;d protect everyone from the aradama?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Uuu... I-I&#x27;ll try my best!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Another unit will handle cleanup from here. We&#x27;re withdrawing. Move quickly, everyone.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Okaaay.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Huh? Are you not going back, Chii-nee?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> I thought I&#x27;d get a little fresh air first.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Then I&#x27;ll stay here with you.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Hey, Mihono-chan. This is a really good team, isn&#x27;t it? Everyone is proud of their role as a toji.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Kofuki-chan might be happy doing nothing but fighting aradama, but she&#x27;s still a good girl who looks after everyone.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> But out there, there are toji happy just to turn their okatana on other people. Why do you think an okatana would choose someone like that?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> You mean Tsubakuro-san? But, saying she&#x27;s happy to use her okatana on people... I&#x27;m not sure about that...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> It might be hard to believe, but I heard from the people at the hidden village. About what happened that day.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> She came from nowhere and tore through all the toji protecting that place. Those girls, who were such respectful toji, she humiliated them as if she were just there to flaunt her strength.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...If things ended up so we had to work together with Tsubakuro-san on a mission, what would you do?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Whether or not I get along with someone, things are different on a mission. I wouldn&#x27;t do anything to get in the way of the task at hand. You don&#x27;t have to worry.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I wasn&#x27;t worried, you know? You&#x27;re all reliable and everything, Chii-nee!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Even as you say that, you can&#x27;t hide it on your face. You&#x27;re a bad liar, Mihono-chan.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ahhh~...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Alright, we should head back. If we stay much later, Mirja-san will scold us.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah, you&#x27;re right.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="7-living-with-pain"></a>7: Living With Pain<a class="hash-link" href="#7-living-with-pain" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Yume:</strong> Pant, pant... Ughhh... Cough...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Are you okay, Yume?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Yeah... I&#x27;m fine... Cough cough cough...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> You don&#x27;t look to be doing very well.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Even after going all the way to the netherworld to bring you back...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Her body is struggling with reverting to how it was before taking in noro.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Maki-onee-san, Suzuka-onee-san, it&#x27;s not the same as before.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> It hurts, but the doctor said I shouldn&#x27;t die, so... If I get to live, then it&#x27;s already so much better than before.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Still...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I told you... I&#x27;m fine! I&#x27;m not that weak!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Right. I know you aren&#x27;t.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> But, were you two always this nice? All you&#x27;ve been doing is looking after me.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Of course we have. We&#x27;re like family.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Like family... Ehehe.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Hey, Maki-onee-san, that strap on your okatana...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Ah, it&#x27;s yours, Yume. I&#x27;ve just been borrowing it for a while.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Before you were saved, Maki-san was running about all over the country together with that strap. Can you believe her?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Running all over...?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> What? It wasn&#x27;t a big deal.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Not a big deal? You seemed to be repeating one reckless thing after another to me?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> We don&#x27;t have to go over that in front of Yume.<br>
<strong>&gt;Suzuka:</strong> I suppose you&#x27;re right... Then I&#x27;ll save the rest for when we go back.<br>
<strong>&gt;Maki:</strong> ...Please be gentle.<br>
<strong>&gt;Yume:</strong> Ahaha, Suzuka-onee-san still pushes you around like she used to.<br>
<strong>&gt;Maki:</strong> Suzuka&#x27;s just too much for me.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Cough, cough, cough... Ughhh...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Some blood came out... Don&#x27;t move, I&#x27;ll clean you up right away.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Thanks... Cough, cough, cough... But, I have to get stronger... I can&#x27;t be weak now...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> No, Yume. You shouldn&#x27;t force yourself. Otherwise, all the effort in saving you would be for nothing.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> That&#x27;s right. What matters most now is that you rest.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Fine, I get it already.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Oh yeah... Can I ask you something? The netherworld... It&#x27;s really big, isn&#x27;t it... How did you find me there?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Well--  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="8-new-orders-1"></a>8: New Orders (1)<a class="hash-link" href="#8-new-orders-1" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Akane:</strong> I&#x27;ve gathered you all here today to explain the role of your investigation team going forward.<br>
<strong>Akane:</strong> To begin with, Souraku Yuzuki, who was in charge of your unit until now, has been relieved of that duty. I, Origami Akane, will be taking that position. From here on out, please act under my command.<br>
<strong>Akane:</strong> Now, in regards to your current duties, the safeguarding of Takirihime and Ichikishimahime will be your top priority.<br>
<strong>Akane:</strong> If either of them, or especially both, are defeated by and absorbed by Tagitsuhime, then the world could be exposed to a crisis beyond anything we&#x27;ve seen before.<br>
<strong>Akane:</strong> We need to do everything possible to prevent that from happening. While continuing to suppress aradama, I will need you continually in a position to quickly respond to any actions Tagitsuhime may take.<br>
<strong>Akane:</strong> At the same time, you will need to be searching for a method to defeat Tagitsuhime. I realize this is a lot to ask of you, but please do the best you can.<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> That sounds like a little too much responsibility for us...<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Why don&#x27;t we just go beat up Tagitsuhime&#x27;s main body in the netherworld? Wouldn&#x27;t that be way easier?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> You would think that, wouldn&#x27;t you, Fukki. Though I think we should do that too.<br>
<strong>Akane:</strong> Unfortunately, with the netherworld being a near-infinite space, identifying Tagitsuhime&#x27;s location would be effectively impossible.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Umm, but wait, then how did we find the great aradama back with Tsubakuro-san?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That&#x27;s right... It did take some time, but it didn&#x27;t feel like an infinite space over there.<br>
<strong>Akane:</strong> There&#x27;s a specific reason why you were able to confront the great aradama which had bound Tsubakuro-san to the netherworld-- designated as Great Aradama Kai.<br>
<strong>Akane:</strong> Without a special link to the netherworld, we can&#x27;t hope to identify our target&#x27;s location within the netherworld. Though with Kai we cleared that condition.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> What condition...?<br>
<strong>Akane:</strong> With both Great Aradama Kai&#x27;s link to Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu, and Tsubakuro Yume&#x27;s connection to the elite guard, we managed to reach their coordinates.<br>
<strong>Akane:</strong> However, in this case--<br>
<strong>Announcer:</strong> Aradama have appeared, aradama have appeared, the location is--<br>
<strong>Akane:</strong> It sounds like there&#x27;s aradama to deal with. I can tell you the rest after you&#x27;re done suppressing them. All of you, please hurry to the scene.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Understood!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="9-new-orders-2"></a>9: New Orders (2)<a class="hash-link" href="#9-new-orders-2" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Akane:</strong> Good work out there. Now then, I&#x27;ll continue where I left off.<br>
<strong>Akane:</strong> As I told you before, given our current situation, destroying Tagitsuhime&#x27;s true body in the netherworld is impossible.<br>
<strong>Akane:</strong> On top of that, after losing Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu&#x27;s utsushi, we are in need of finding something else to destroy her.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Something else... Like what?<br>
<strong>Akane:</strong> I&#x27;d like to ask you to include that in your investigation.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> What, you mean we&#x27;re starting from scratch? Must be easy sitting cozy in here while we do all the work.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Shichinosato Kofuki, please be careful with what you have to say.<br>
<strong>Akane:</strong> No, she&#x27;s not wrong. I&#x27;m sorry to put this much of a burden on you. Even so, could you please search for a method?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> As it&#x27;s a part of our mission, we have no reason to refuse. We&#x27;ll work diligently to meet your expectations.<br>
<strong>Akane:</strong> Thank you very much. Also, at the present time, I would like to officially add both Yamashiro Yui and Suzumoto Hana to this investigation team.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Huh? You two weren&#x27;t officially with us before?<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> Technically we&#x27;ve still only been considered temporary reinforcements.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Wait, seriously!?<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> Why are you acting surprised? They must have told you this before.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ahh~, I remember something like that, but when I heard I&#x27;d get to join with the famous investigation team loaded with cuties, I was so happy about it, I think I ended up forgetting everything else. Teehee!<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> Don&#x27;t give me &quot;Teehee!&quot; Remember? When the raid on the Origami estate happened, you forgot to tell everyone else about me!<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> Thanks to that, Kofuki-san nearly chopped my head off!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> .........Did I do that? Teehee!<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> I can&#x27;t believe you... Back then, when I read the mission report, it said Yamashiro Yui was a hardworking girl who enthusiastically did her duty, you know.<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> But when girls are involved, it&#x27;s a different story...? It took me a while to understand.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Ufufu, that&#x27;s Yui-chan alright.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ahaha, I guess that&#x27;s me for you, so I&#x27;ll introduce myself again. Let&#x27;s get along~!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Same here, we&#x27;re glad to have you!<br>
<strong>Akane:</strong> One last thing. With everything being reorganized, your investigation team has been officially designated [YOUR TEAM NAME HERE]. I expect good results from you girls.<br>
<strong>Akane:</strong> That&#x27;s all, you&#x27;re dismissed.<br>
<strong>Other:</strong> Yui&#x27;s Excuse<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> Really, I can&#x27;t believe you... You think you can get out of letting Kofuki-san nearly cut my head off with just &quot;Teehee!&quot;?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> You don&#x27;t have to blame me for it~. I didn&#x27;t even know that I was supposed to tell them about you on that mission.<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> You didn&#x27;t know!?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I mean, back when Aoto Youji-san told me everything, all he said was &quot;there&#x27;s another person who&#x27;ll be helping you out&quot; right at the end.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> So all I was thinking is there&#x27;s somebody else to look out for.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Since he didn&#x27;t make a big deal out of it, I figured everybody else already knew.<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> Ahh... Since it&#x27;s that guy, I can believe it...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> See? And it happened so long ago, so just forget about it, forget about it. Now I have to go talk to Mirja-san, it&#x27;s almost time. This is an important mission too.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Nnn~, I get to have Mirja-san all to myself on this mission. Could I get any luckier-!<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> Hey, wait... You&#x27;re forgetting me again. It&#x27;s the three of us going together, remember!?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ah, really? Teehee!<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> Stop saying &quot;Teehee&quot;! You&#x27;re impossible...</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations/edit/docs/Part 3/3-1_Assembly.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_2_ui" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_3DPF"></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/tnm-translations/docs/Part 2/2-11_The_Netherworld/"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Â« 2-11 The Netherworld</div></a></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/tnm-translations/docs/Part 3/3-2_The_Dark_Shadow_Working_Behind_the_Scenes/"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Next</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">3-2 The Dark Shadow Working Behind the Scenes Â»</div></a></div></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_35-E thin-scrollbar"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#1-back-with-your-leader" class="table-of-contents__link">1: Back with Your Leader</a></li><li><a href="#2-mother" class="table-of-contents__link">2: Mother</a></li><li><a href="#3-what-a-toji-should-do-1" class="table-of-contents__link">3: What a Toji Should Do (1)</a></li><li><a href="#4-what-a-toji-should-do-2" class="table-of-contents__link">4: What a Toji Should Do (2)</a></li><li><a href="#5-unyielding-feelings-1" class="table-of-contents__link">5: Unyielding Feelings (1)</a></li><li><a href="#6-unyielding-feelings-2" class="table-of-contents__link">6: Unyielding Feelings (2)</a></li><li><a href="#7-living-with-pain" class="table-of-contents__link">7: Living With Pain</a></li><li><a href="#8-new-orders-1" class="table-of-contents__link">8: New Orders (1)</a></li><li><a href="#9-new-orders-2" class="table-of-contents__link">9: New Orders (2)</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Links</div><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://pastebin.com/LdyviZ8Z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Translator anon&#x27;s pastebin<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Site source code<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Built with Docusaurus.</div></div></div></footer></div>
