Do you know where Yui is?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> I haven&#x27;t seen her today. Did you need her for something?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Not really. It&#x27;s just, it&#x27;s been all quiet this morning, so I was wondering if she&#x27;s in some kind of trouble.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> That&#x27;s true. Normally by this time you&#x27;d be hearing the shrieks of girls Yui-chan went after, but it is awfully quiet today.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Right? If Yui&#x27;s not going around sniffing girls as they wake up, then something has to have gone wrong!<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> I think something&#x27;s gone wrong if she&#x27;s doing that in the first place, but... It probably is worth looking into.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I went to her room, but she&#x27;s not there.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah, have you two seen Hana-san?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve seen her today.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Me neither.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Everyone else is saying the same thing. I wonder where she went.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Oi, you seen Mirja around? I&#x27;ve been trying to find her, but she&#x27;s nowhere.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Mirja-san too? I wonder why all three from Ayanokouji are the ones missing.<br>
<strong>Announcement:</strong> Aradama have appeared, aradama have appeared, the location is--<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> We should go deal with that. There&#x27;s a good chance we&#x27;ll run into those three when we get there.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="2-unease-2"></a>2: Unease (2)<a class="hash-link" href="#2-unease-2" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> Mirja-san and them never showed up, huh.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> They&#x27;re probably slacking off somewhere. Taking their paycheck while we do all the work. Well, with them not around I get more aradama-chan to play with.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Still, where could they have gone?<br>
<strong>Akane:</strong> Early this morning, all Ayanokouji toji were called back to Ayanokouji.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Akane-sama, every one of them was called back? Why would they do that?<br>
<strong>Akane:</strong> Even I&#x27;m not sure of their reasoning. The decision was made secretly within Ayanokouji. I wasn&#x27;t aware of it myself until just now.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> You mean President Souraku is taking things into her own hands?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> What&#x27;s going on here? Isn&#x27;t Akane-sama the big boss? Are you going to let her get away with that?<br>
<strong>Akane:</strong> I&#x27;m ashamed to admit this, but ever since my sister went into hiding, the chain of command in the Five Traditions hasn&#x27;t been functioning properly.<br>
<strong>Akane:</strong> But, at a time like this... I can&#x27;t imagine what she&#x27;s thinking.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> I don&#x27;t like it. It&#x27;s got bad news written all over.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It feels that way, but... I hope it&#x27;s nothing.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> I am worried about it, but for Mirja-san and the others to go along, they must have something in mind.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> In which case, all we can do is wait for them to get back.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> That&#x27;s right. It might be tough with just the four of us for a while, but we&#x27;ll do our best while they&#x27;re away.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> I&#x27;ll cut up their share of aradama-chan for them while they&#x27;re gone!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="3-chasing-after-the-one-you-admire-1"></a>3: Chasing After the One You Admire (1)<a class="hash-link" href="#3-chasing-after-the-one-you-admire-1" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Uchizato Ayumu:</strong> Ei! Yah! Sa!<br>
<strong>Tanabe Miya:</strong> Why not take a break? You&#x27;ve been pushing yourself so hard lately, Ayumu.<br>
<strong>Ayumu:</strong> That&#x27;s because I made a promise with Etou-san! That one day, I&#x27;d fight alongside her!<br>
<strong>Miya:</strong> Etou-san? Ahh, you mean Etou Kanami-san.<br>
<strong>Ayumu:</strong> Right now, I&#x27;m nothing compared to Etou-san, so I have to train a whole lot more if I want to get stronger!<br>
<strong>Miya:</strong> You really look up to Etou-san, don&#x27;t you?<br>
<strong>Ayumu:</strong> Yeah!<br>
<strong>Miya:</strong> She was so strong, wasn&#x27;t she? But we were pretty useless in comparison.<br>
<strong>Miya:</strong> If Etou-san hadn&#x27;t been there to save us, who knows what would have happened... I don&#x27;t want to think about it.<br>
Several weeks earlier--</p><p>During an aradama suppression mission.</p><p><strong>Unit Leader:</strong> After the firing squad stops, we&#x27;ll rush in! Match each other&#x27;s timing! If you do it like in training, you&#x27;ll make it through!<br>

It&#x27;s so one sided... Even with all of us together, we couldn&#x27;t do anything, but...<br>
<strong>Ayumu:</strong> Especially Etou-san... The aradama can&#x27;t even come close to her... And her swordsmanship too... I had no idea someone could fight like that. She&#x27;s so amazing...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> You&#x27;re doing great, Sayaka-chan!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> You would be fine even if I weren&#x27;t here, Kanami.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Huh? That&#x27;s not true.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> If we fought seriously, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be able to land a hit on you. That&#x27;s the difference between us.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> That&#x27;s not...<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> You should know, Kanami. You&#x27;re the only one in a distant place.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> .........<br>
<strong>Unit Leader:</strong> Thank you for the assistance, you two. We&#x27;ll handle processing the aftermath.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Okay, please do.<br>
<strong>Ayumu:</strong> She said Etou-san was all alone in a distant place...<br>
<strong>Ayumu:</strong> I couldn&#x27;t do anything back then, but next time will be different. I&#x27;ll be able to fight properly then!<br>
<strong>Ayumu:</strong> I just have to get stronger! I want to get stronger, so I can become a useful toji like Etou-san!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> It&#x27;s good to see you so dedicated to your practice, but did you not hear the announcement?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> They asked for all interview applicants to head to the President&#x27;s room. Please get yourself ready and head there at once.<br>
<strong>Miya:</strong> That was Kitora-senpai just now, wasn&#x27;t it? She left already...<br>
<strong>Miya:</strong> Ah, more importantly, you&#x27;re one of those interview applicants, aren&#x27;t you, Ayumu? If you don&#x27;t move fast you&#x27;ll get yelled at.<br>
<strong>Ayumu:</strong> R-Right!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="5-interview"></a>5: Interview<a class="hash-link" href="#5-interview" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Hana:</strong> Thank you very much for the interview. Then, if you&#x27;ll excuse me!<br>
<strong>Yuzuki:</strong> Suzumoto Hana... Her noro compatibility is high, and she hopes to join the imperial guard. It&#x27;s hard to ask for a more ideal subject.<br>
<strong>Yuzuki:</strong> But, considering her involvement as a spy for Mokusa, I have no option but to disqualify her.<br>
<strong>Yuzuki:</strong> Now then-- Next applicant, enter!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Excuse me. I&#x27;m Yamashiro Yui, second year in middle school.<br>
<strong>Yuzuki:</strong> This may be sudden, but let&#x27;s cut to the heart of the matter. You strongly wish to join the imperial guard, don&#x27;t you?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Yes, I was told they earn a much larger salary!<br>
<strong>Yuzuki:</strong> Do you need that much for your sister&#x27;s medical expenses?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> ......!!<br>
<strong>Yuzuki:</strong> What are you surprised about? As a candidate for the imperial guard, you should expect I&#x27;d perform a background check on you.<br>
<strong>Yuzuki:</strong> Or is it a subject you didn&#x27;t want to be brought up? If that&#x27;s the case, then I apologize.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> N-No... It&#x27;s fine... I was just taken a little off guard.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> If you already know my situation, then that makes this easier. I need money for my sister.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> So please, let me join the imperial guard! I promise I&#x27;ll work to earn that money. No, I can work no matter how hard you need me to!<br>
<strong>Yuzuki:</strong> It&#x27;s good to see you&#x27;re so motivated. On top of which, you do have high compatibility with noro.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> High compatibility with noro? What are you talking about?<br>
<strong>Yuzuki:</strong> One of the conditions of joining the imperial guard is to accept injections of noro into your body.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> But... Injecting noro into yourself... That&#x27;s dangerous, isn&#x27;t it!?<br>
<strong>Yuzuki:</strong> That&#x27;s right... You&#x27;re aware of the circumstances involving Tsubakuro Yume, aren&#x27;t you? No, you should know the others in the elite guard as well. Of course you&#x27;d feel apprehensive.<br>
<strong>Yuzuki:</strong> However, the strengthening drugs you&#x27;ll be administered are the latest formula. Compared to the previous formula, the risks are far lower.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Lower? That means there&#x27;s still a risk, doesn&#x27;t it?<br>
<strong>Yuzuki:</strong> It does. I want you to consider this offer understanding that. If you find it unreasonable, then I won&#x27;t blame you for withdrawing your application.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> ............I&#x27;ll withdraw.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I do need the money, but if anything happened to me, then Miku-- Then my sister wouldn&#x27;t be able to pay for her treatment.<br>
<strong>Yuzuki:</strong> I see... Then you may leave.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Thank you.<br>
<strong>Yuzuki:</strong> Sigh... Uchizato Ayumu and Kitora Mirja are the only ones left?<br>
<strong>Yuzuki:</strong> It goes without saying, but to have made it this far they each have high compatibility with noro.<br>
<strong>Yuzuki:</strong> Regardless of who I chose, they would become an excellent Myouga toji.<br>
<strong>Yuzuki:</strong> But... I can&#x27;t allow these girls to get involved in this.<br>
<strong>Yuzuki:</strong> As their president, this is the least I can do for them. Yukina will be upset, I&#x27;m sure...  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="6-escape-1"></a>6: Escape (1)<a class="hash-link" href="#6-escape-1" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>At Ayanokouji Martial Arts School, several hours after President Souraku Yuzuki&#x27;s imperial guard selection interviews had concluded--</p><p><strong>Mirja:</strong> The president has been behaving strangely, so I did some investigating of my own. But I never thought she&#x27;d go as far as forming a guard to protect Tagitsuhime.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Eh, Tagitsuhime!? I never heard anything like that!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Of course, it was beyond all my expectations as well. I returned to see why she recalled everyone so urgently, but... I never imagined it would end up like this.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I trust the two of you have no interest in joining her guard either?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> No way, no way! I told her no right away. There&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m letting them put noro in me!<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> I failed the interview anyway. I have no idea what I did wrong.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> So then, Mirja-san...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I refused her, saying I wanted to continue with the investigation team.<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> So, Mirja-senpai, what are we doing next?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> We&#x27;ll get away from here as soon as possible and report this to the investigation team. With things as they are, we can&#x27;t afford to stay any longer.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Every moment that passes is a disadvantage for us.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> As members of the investigation team, if we were to suddenly disappear, it&#x27;s highly likely someone would come after us.<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> In that case, we&#x27;ll just have to force our way through, won&#x27;t we...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> It would be best not to move so conspicuously. We should split up from here.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Got it! Then, I&#x27;ll see you two on the other side. There&#x27;s a big hug waiting for you next time we meet!<br>
<strong>Hana:</strong> Honestly, you just don&#x27;t quit, do you? ...Be sure you make it back, Yui.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Then, until this is over.<br>
Several more hours later, with Kitora Mirja--</p><p><strong>Mirja:</strong> I knew we would be followed, but I hardly expected to see you.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Third seat of the elite guard, Satsuki Yomi.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> You&#x27;re going to become a Myouga toji.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Myouga toji? Is that what you&#x27;re calling toji strengthened by noro? I&#x27;ve already refused that offer.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Your wishes don&#x27;t matter here. You&#x27;ll become a pawn for her.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I&#x27;ll say it again. I refuse.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> If I wound you badly enough here, even if you dislike it, you&#x27;ll accept the noro to save your own life. The same as the other toji did.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> You... You attacked other toji like that!?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Is there a problem?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> How could you...!<br>

<strong>Kofuki:</strong> You worry about everything, Chichie. Think about it, maybe they&#x27;re on an assignment out somewhere and their phones ran out of battery?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> ...I&#x27;m sorry. I can&#x27;t help but think back to when Mokusa was attacked...<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> This is nothing like that though. They just went back home to their school. Who&#x27;d even be attacking them?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Besides, you just know anyone trying to break in there is gonna have a way worse time.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> They say that no news is good news. I&#x27;m sure everyone is doing fine.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah, I mean, it&#x27;s Mirja-san we&#x27;re talking about. She wouldn&#x27;t let anything go wrong that easy.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> You&#x27;re right. It&#x27;s not as if anything&#x27;s actually happened, so I shouldn&#x27;t be thinking so negatively.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> When it comes down to it, I just wish the people making decisions around here would get it together.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> I don&#x27;t care if they&#x27;re showing off or looking to grab some power. What&#x27;re people doing fighting between each other now?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Whoa, Fukki said something sensible for once!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Alright Mihocchi, stick your ass out for me so I can kick it.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> It&#x27;s just like Kofuki-chan said. With the threat that Tagitsuhime poses, we all need to work together...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> And I of all people...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Chii-nee...<br>
<strong>Announcement:</strong> Aradama have appeared, aradama have appeared, the location is--<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Let&#x27;s go, everyone. There&#x27;s something for us that needs to be done.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Alright-! I&#x27;ll love you to my heart&#x27;s content, my aradama-chan!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="9-unshakeable-doubt-2"></a>9: Unshakeable Doubt (2)<a class="hash-link" href="#9-unshakeable-doubt-2" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Phew, that feels way better! Nothing beats playing with aradama-chan after all. Best to keep things simple, just kill or be killed.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> But still, you keep running off on your own, Fukki.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Why&#x27;re you whining about that now? You know that&#x27;s how I play.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I already know the answer, but you don&#x27;t care at all to work on that, do you?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> If you know already, then just give it up.<br>
<strong>Announcement:</strong> Will the investigation team please assemble in the briefing room at once. I repeat--<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That&#x27;s awfully quick after we just got back. What could they want?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> We&#x27;ll know when we get there. Come on, let&#x27;s go.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="10-a-return-full-of-wounds"></a>10: A Return Full of Wounds<a class="hash-link" href="#10-a-return-full-of-wounds" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Sana:</strong> First off, good work. Thanks to your investigation team&#x27;s efforts, we&#x27;ve managed to keep casualties to a minimum. I couldn&#x27;t ask for much more out of you.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> You&#x27;ve got me around, of course it&#x27;s like that.<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> Hmm? Someone&#x27;s feeling cocky. If you&#x27;ve got that kind of energy to spare, I was worried for nothing. Time for your next mission.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Oh! Sounds good! So long as I get to mess with more aradama-chan, then keep it coming!<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> Huh, unlike a certain other chihuahua you seem plenty motivated. Though, sorry to get your hopes up, but this one isn&#x27;t about aradama suppression.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> What, then what&#x27;s the point!? Where am I supposed to unload all this motivation!?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> What is this mission about then?<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> You&#x27;re being sent to the Ministry of Defense, to safeguard Takirihime. With the situation as it is, it wouldn&#x27;t be unusual if Tagitsuhime attacked any day now. We can never have enough people over there.<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> If Takirihime ends up merging with Tagitsuhime, we&#x27;d be lucky to get off as easy as we did with the disaster twenty years ago.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Umm, but, can we really trust Takirihime either? She used to be a part of Tagitsuhime, didn&#x27;t she?<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> Asakura&#x27;s concern is reasonable, but at the very least, she doesn&#x27;t seem to have any ill will towards humanity.<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> Tagitsuhime plans on eradicating humanity, while Ichikishima wants to create a new world through the unification of humanity and aradama.<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> And Takirihime offers to guide humanity through coexistence.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Guide makes it sound nice and all, but what she really means is she&#x27;ll dominate us, right? At the end of the day we&#x27;d just be like farm animals.<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> Even still, there&#x27;s room for debate with her. Which is why we can&#x27;t allow the three goddesses to fuse together again under any circumstances.<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> While they&#x27;re split into three, if we can manage to defeat Tagitsuhime, we&#x27;d like to negotiate with the other two to find a less aggressive solution.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I think I get it.<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> Akane-sama already headed over there wtih Etou and Juujou. You four will follow after them.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I&#x27;ve made it... Back...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> M-Mirja-san!? Wait... She&#x27;s bleeding everywhere... We have to get her some first aid quick!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> These wounds are terrible... Were you fighting an aradama...?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> No, that&#x27;s not it. An aradama didn&#x27;t do this. Look, this is a cut from a sword.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> A sword... Huh? How did... What happened!?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> If Mirja-san&#x27;s injured this badly... Then who did it? You mean... Tagitsuhime!?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Calm down, Mihono-chan. What matters most is that we take care of Mirja-san right now.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> It isn&#x27;t as bad, as it looks. I can receive medical treatment later. Before that, I have to make my report right away.<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> ...Then you can tell us while you&#x27;re getting treated.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Un... derstood.<br>
<strong>Other:</strong> Mirja&#x27;s Condition<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> Kitora Mirja&#x27;s condition... It&#x27;s concerning, you know.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> I thought so. Just from looking at her, she seems seriously injured...<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> If things are as bad as they seem... Chie. You may need to assume the role of commanding your team for the time being. Keep that in mind.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> I-I understand...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Director Maniwa! Apparently Mirja-san&#x27;s wounds aren&#x27;t actually that deep. They said she can join in the meeting later too!<br>
<strong>Sana:</strong> Well that&#x27;s a relief. But still, sending her back to work is another issue entirely. I should go talk to her a little...<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Sigh... It&#x27;s not just Mirja-san. I&#x27;m worried about Yui-chan and Hana-chan too. We haven&#x27;t heard any reports of them showing up yet.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll be fine! You worry too much, Chii-nee! Come on, let&#x27;s all go check in on Mirja-san! Okay?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Mirja-san, Yui-chan, Hana-chan... Just what happened out there...</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations/edit/docs/Part 3/3-2_The_Dark_Shadow_Working_Behind_the_Scenes.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_2_ui" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_3DPF"></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/tnm-translations/docs/Part 3/3-1_Assembly/"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Â« 3-1 Assembly</div></a></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/tnm-translations/docs/Part 3/3-3_Takirihime/"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Next</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">3-3 Takirihime Â»</div></a></div></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_35-E thin-scrollbar"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#1-unease-1" class="table-of-contents__link">1: Unease (1)</a></li><li><a href="#2-unease-2" class="table-of-contents__link">2: Unease (2)</a></li><li><a href="#3-chasing-after-the-one-you-admire-1" class="table-of-contents__link">3: Chasing After the One You Admire (1)</a></li><li><a href="#4-chasing-after-the-one-you-admire-2" class="table-of-contents__link">4: Chasing After the One You Admire (2)</a></li><li><a href="#5-interview" class="table-of-contents__link">5: Interview</a></li><li><a href="#6-escape-1" class="table-of-contents__link">6: Escape (1)</a></li><li><a href="#7-escape-2" class="table-of-contents__link">7: Escape (2)</a></li><li><a href="#8-unshakeable-doubt-1" class="table-of-contents__link">8: Unshakeable Doubt (1)</a></li><li><a href="#9-unshakeable-doubt-2" class="table-of-contents__link">9: Unshakeable Doubt (2)</a></li><li><a href="#10-a-return-full-of-wounds" class="table-of-contents__link">10: A Return Full of Wounds</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Links</div><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://pastebin.com/LdyviZ8Z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Translator anon&#x27;s pastebin<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Site source code<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Built with Docusaurus.</div></div></div></footer></div>
