## 1: Unit One's Training Camp
**Minato:** Sigh... Not much time left in our New Year's break, huh. I didn't get to mess around anywhere near as much as I wanted... Hey, Kagari, wanna go have some fun somewhere?  
**Kagari:** Why would I go with you, Minato-senpai... Besides, I have my work to do for the Origami family, so no thank you.  
**Minato:** Ehh-, then what about if I invite Yukari too? That way you'd have to come along with us. When should we go? Hey-, when do you have some free time?  
**Kagari:** (Sigh, she always forces things to go her way... Honestly, why does she feel the need to involve herself in others' business like this?)  
**Yukari:** Minato, I hate to tell you this, but we won't have any time to enjoy ourselves. Starting tomorrow, at Yuzuki-senpai's proposal, we of Renpu Senior High School's Unit One will be undergoing a training camp.  
**Kagari:** A training camp!?  
The next day.

  
**Fushimi Yuzuki:** Seems like we're all here.  
**Minato:** Huh? But Ema and Iroha-senpai aren't here yet?  
**Yukari:** The two of them are busy with a mission and won't be attending. I thought I told you that yesterday.  
**Minato:** Ahaha, you did? I might've been too distracted figuring out what snacks to bring to listen.  
**Kagari:** (Sigh... She isn't showing an ounce of stress. Well, it's not as if Minato-senpai's the only one like that...)  
**Sagami Yukina:** Sana, will you look at this! Aren't these pajamas so cute? I bought them just for today, after I heard I would be staying the night with Yukari-onee-sama~.  
**Arami Sana:** Whoa-, that's super frilly... I bet it'd look great on you, Yukina-senpai.  
**Yukina:** Wouldn't it~? Fufu, tonight I'll be sleeping in this, holding hands with Yukari-onee-sama~. I can't wait~!  
**Yukina:** Hiiragi-san, just so you know, the futon next to Yukari-onee-sama belongs to me! I'm not letting you have it no matter what.  
**Kagari:** Sigh... Sorry to spoil your fun, but Yukari-sama has said she will be sleeping in her own private room.  
**Yukina:** What did you say!? Don't tell me, you're the one who put Yukari-onee-sama up to this...  
**Kagari:** Yukari-sama decided upon it herself. And, I'll tell you just so you know, we aren't holding this training camp so you can amuse yourself.  
**Yukina:** I don't need you to tell me that. Anyway, don't you think there are others you should be lecturing instead of me?  
**Kagari:** Others I should be lecturing...?  
**Sana:** Wow-, Minato-senpai. Look at all the snacks you're bringing! You think you could share some of that with me-?  
**Minato:** Hmm, then, how about we make a trade? You let me borrow that game you're bringing and it's a deal.  
**Sana:** Eh-!? But I just bought this game! I was only bringing it 'cause I thought I'd be able to 100% it during the camp-!  
**Kagari:** (Sigh... None of them are taking this seriously at all.)  
**Kagari:** (This training camp is an important step in preparing our unit to be strong enough should a great disaster happen... Do they not understand our purpose here?)  
**Kagari:** (No, they must understand it. It's just that, when the time comes, the weight of their duties isn't as heavy as the one I must do. That's why they can be so carefree...)  
**Minato:** Yukari, Yuzuki-senpai, here we go-! TAAAAAAA-!  
**Kagari:** (I wasn't sure how things would turn out at first, but I should have expected this from Minato-senpai. The moment we began to practice, she became so serious it was like looking at a different person.)  
**Kagari:** (Yukari-sama and Yuzuki-senpai too, with the way they can predict each other's movements, the upperclassman team is impressively coordinated. On the other hand...)  
**Yukina:** Hey, Hiiragi-san! Sana! Why are you getting out ahead of me!?  
**Kagari:** You're the one who's moving too slowly. If this were actual combat, that opening would absolutely come under attack.  
**Sana:** Yeah, when it comes down to it, I'm not gonna hold back anything either.  
**Yukina:** Hmph, trying to fight while working with you two is so stupid I'd rather not even try anymore.  
**Minato:** Ahaha-! It's like this every time; the three on the underclassman team are so out of sync it's hilarious.  
**Yuzuki:** Yes, I've spotted the greatest issue for us to work through here.  
**Yukari:** Right. During this camp, our greatest priority should be improving the teamwork of those three.  
**Yuzuki:** I can think of a number of methods, but what do you think we should do for them to improve, Yukari?  
**Yukari:** If you ask me, it would be best if we found a way to bring them closer using this camp environment during the brief time we have here...  
**Minato:** In that case, what if we put the underclassman team in charge of tonight's dinner? If they finish a common goal together, won't it deepen their friendship! You three feel the same, right?  
**Sana:** Dinner duty!? Minato-senpai, isn't it more like you just thought it'd be a pain in the butt doing it yourself?  
**Kagari:** The three of us, in charge of dinner? There's a limit to how inefficient you can make this. Since we went to the lengths of coming here, I believe we should spend our time doing more proper training exercises.  
**Yukina:** I don't want to be with these two either. I thought I would finally get to spend 24 hours together with Yukari-onee-sama...  
**Yukari:** Yukina, Sana, Kagari, this is an order from your captain. In order to improve your teamwork, you are to carry out this training at once.  
**Sana:** If it's the captain's orders, I guess we don't have a choice but to go with it...  
**Kagari:** Yes, once an order is given, we'll carry it out straight away. First, we'll need to do the shopping. Come on, Sagami-san, let's go.  
**Yukina:** Could you not order me around? I'm only going because Yukari-onee-sama told me to.  
**Minato:** Can those three actually manage to get along for long enough to go shopping...?  
**Yuzuki:** Being able to overcome that is another part of their training.  
**Yukari:** That's right. Now that we've ordered them out, all we can do is wait and believe in them.  

## 2: Dinner Cooking Fraught with Trouble
**Kagari:** Before we begin buying anything, I think we should first decide on a dinner menu, but what are you two best at cooking...  
**Kagari:** Oh? Sana and Sagami-san must have left at some point. Where could they have gone...  
**Sana:** Kagari-senpai, I went ahead and put what I want to eat in the shopping basket!  
**Kagari:** Hang on, Sana, you can't only buy this many snacks. You won't be able to eat them all, will you?  
**Sana:** It's all good. Sweets go in a different stomach, right? Besides, if we have to, Minato-senpai and me'll take responsibility and eat all of it!  
**Kagari:** Really now... Do you know where Sagami-san went, by the way? I haven't seen her since we came in.  
**Sana:** If you're looking for Yukina-senpai, she's over at the counter there.  
**Yukina:** Fufufu~. Fish broiled in soy sauce, chopped burdock, spinach in tofu salad with white miso dressing; since Yukari-onee-sama loves Japanese style dishes, she'll be so happy.  
**Kagari:** Wait, Sagami-san, aren't these all pre-packaged side dishes? The mission we were given was to work together, from buying the ingredients to cooking dinner. Just buying them pre-packaged is missing the point.  
**Yukina:** Well, if I tried to work with you two, we'd never finish even if we had all the time in the world.  
**Kagari:** But it's our objective here to do something about that. Let's first think up a menu together... Sana, please stop buying any more snacks.  
**Kagari:** (Sigh... As disorganized as we are, can we even reach a finished dinner without incident? I'm concerned with what's coming next...)  
**Kagari:** In the end, we never decided on a menu, and only bought ingredients for what each of us wanted to cook. Will this really be alright...  
**Sana:** Huh? Yukina-senpai, you're so good with a knife! It's sorta surprising...  
**Yukina:** A toji uses their okatana every day, so it's only natural.  
**Sana:** Oh yeah. Then, let me try cutting some stuff too.  
**Sana:** Wah-, that's crazy! Vegetables and fish both feel totally different when you cut them. Cooking's actually pretty fun when you give it a shot, huh, Kagari-senpai.  
**Kagari:** Yes, I know... Wait, hold on, Sana, that fish you're cutting, that's the one I bought for the nimono I was making.  
**Sana:** Eh-!? You should tell me that sooner-. I already chopped it down to bite size pieces.  
**Kagari:** There's no use getting upset over what's already done. I'll have to come up with a new dinner menu... Using the ingredients I have left, I can... Eh?  
**Kagari:** Sagami-san, right now, what you're cutting, that's the daikon radish I bought to use for making grated radish, isn't it?  
**Yukina:** Oh, it was? My hands were free, so I thought I'd cut it. You should be thanking me then.  
**Kagari:** But, when it's cut into such small bits, I can't make grated radish from it...  
**Yukina:** So what!? If you're going to complain, then you should have put your name on it from the start.  
**Kagari:** ...  
**Sana:** Kagari-senpai, I just went and cut up the stuff that was around here, but what can I make with this?  
**Kagari:** Sana, normally you decide on a menu before you begin cutting anything. Asking me to think of what you can cook in this situation is...  
**Yukina:** Well now, look who's shying away. Isn't it your responsibility to bring this all together, Hiiragi-san?  
**Sana:** Sorry, I also thought you'd be able to pull something together from this, Kagari-senpai... I guess it's no good after all?  
**Kagari:** Unbelievable. You two rely on me far too much to get things done.  
**Minato:** Yikes-, it's looking even more tense in there than when the training camp started, isn't it.  
**Yuzuki:** I'd planned on staying quiet and seeing how things progressed, but wouldn't it be best to step in soon?  
**Yukari:** Still, if we simply help them out here, they won't have improved on anything. We should hold off a little longer...  
	[Minato's stomach growls]

  
**Kagari:** Is somebody there? Please stop hiding and come out.  
**Minato:** Ahaha, you found me out, huh-. Sorry about that, we were just worried so we came to check up on you.  
**Yukari:** You seem to be awfully at odds with each other, but do you think you can finish in time for dinner like we agreed on?  
**Kagari:** About that...  
**Minato:** It's growling again. My stomach's so empty I just can't wait anymore-. Kagari-, if you don't make me some food soon, my stomach's gonna growl so hard it breaks.  
**Kagari:** You say that, but... I can't come up with anything to make from these carelessly chopped up ingredients.  
**Yuzuki:** You're right, I'm at a loss of what to do here. It'd be a challenge finding a menu that could make use of all these...  
**Minato:** You're kidding... But there's all this food in front of me-.  
**Minato:** Ahh-, I got it! I just came up with a crazy good idea!  

## 3: The End Result of Dinner is...
**Yuzuki:** A good idea? Minato, what did you come up with?  
**Yukari:** Did you think of some way to resolve this situation?  
**Minato:** Yep, yep. And here I'll show you how it's done!  
**Minato:** We'll take the ingredients here, every last one, and toss them in a hotpot!  
**Kagari:** Hotpot...? I see.  
**Yuzuki:** That's true, with a hotpot, we can cook a variety of ingredients together into something that tastes good.  
**Sana:** Leave it to Minato-senpai!  
**Yukina:** With a strong enough appetite helping her, even Minato-senpai can come up with a good idea sometimes.  
**Minato:** C'mon~, it wasn't that good.  
**Sana:** Uh, Minato-senpai, that wasn't a compliment.  
**Yukari:** At any rate, we don't have much time to prepare dinner, so starting now let's all work together regardless of class.  
**Kagari/Yukina/Sana:** Right.  
**Yukari:** Kagari, I'll be getting the broth together, so come help me.  
**Yukina:** Yukari-onee-samaa, if you need help, I'll do it for youu~.  
**Kagari:** I don't feel quite right leaving you in charge of the flavor. I know the way they make it in the Origami househould, so I'll help with this.  
**Yukina:** What's with you!? I just want to cook with Onee-sama too, okay!  
**Minato:** Yukina, if you're free, come help me out. We'll chop up the leftover veggies together.  
**Yukina:** Why do I have to be with Minato-senpai...  
**Yukari:** Yukina, right now, what we need to do is cooperate to finish making dinner. Please go lend Minato a hand.  
**Yukina:** If you're the one asking me, Onee-sama, then I'll do my best~.  
**Minato:** Hey, now you're looking motivated. So then, Yukina, let's have a contest to see who can chop them up the fastest!  
**Yukina:** Why would we compete... Still, if that's how it is, then there's no way I'll lose.  
**Kagari:** (Incredible, as soon as everyone decided on a goal and began to cooperate, the cooking is quickly coming along... That's the effect teamwork has...)  
**Minato:** Whoa-, there's a kotatsu waiting for us-!  
**Yuzuki:** While everyone was preparing dinner, Sana and I got one ready. It looks like the hotpot is done too, so before we begin eating, let's hear an overview of today's efforts from our captain.  
**Yukari:** You all did well our first day of the training camp. Our objective at this camp is to improve our teamwork, and...  
	[Minato's stomach growls]

  
**Minato:** Yukari-, I can't take it anymore! Can't we talk about this while we're eating? Let's eat already-.  
**Kagari:** Minato-senpai. Honestly, you're so...  
**Yukari:** Though, Minato may have the right idea here. Everyone, go ahead and eat up so you can be ready for tomorrow's practice.  
**Kagari/Yukina/Sana:** Let's eat.  
**Minato:** Mmm~, so good~! You can't have winter without a hotpot, am I right?  
**Sana:** Hafu, hafu*... That's right! Ah, the bits of radish Yukina-senpai chopped up all small soaked up the flavor and taste really good.	[*The sound people make while eating something good, but hot, trying to breathe in through their mouth to cool it down. Onomatopoeia is hard.]  
**Yukina:** Of course they do, because I'm the one who chopped them up. Hafu, hafu... Oh, these slices of fish are delicious too!  
**Kagari:** Those would be the fish Sana chopped up by mistake. It turned out for the best not using it to make nimono.  
**Sana:** Eheheh, I guess I was right for getting it wrong then.  
**Minato:** Wait-, the three on the underclassman team, they're acting all close out of nowhere digging into the hotpot.  
**Yuzuki:** It's hard to imagine the tense atmosphere they had earlier.  
**Yukari:** As they say, those who eat out of the same pot stay close. I'm relieved to see the training camp is already producing results.  
**Minato:** (Oh, I'm glad that Yukari-sama is feeling relieved. I wasn't sure if we would make it for a moment, but we were saved this time thanks to Minato-senpai's idea.)  
**Kagari:** (Thinking on it more, even outside of battle, Minato-senpai helps us out, doesn't she.)  
**Kagari:** (I don't exactly wish to admit it, but, Minato-senpai might be an amazing person after all...)
