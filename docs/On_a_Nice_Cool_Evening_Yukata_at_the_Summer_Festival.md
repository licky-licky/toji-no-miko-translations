## 1: Festival Excitement, Floating Lanterns
**Yume:**ã€€Wowww-! There's already so many stands set up! I can't wait for the festival to start~.  
**Yomi:** Tsubakuro-san. By running around like that, you're obstructing the people constructing stands and transporting goods.  
**Maki:** Yomi's right, Yume. We came here with Yukari-sama to lead and the supervise the toji joining in the festival, as part of giving back to the community.  
**Yume:** Ehhh, but it's boring if that's all we get to do-.  
**Yume:** Hey, Yukari-sama~? After the festival gets started, we can go around and check out whatever we want, right-?  
**Suzuka:** We aren't here to play, Yume. Our mission here is simply to patrol the area.  
**Yume:** Ehh~...  
**Yukari:** So long as you remember not to neglect your patrol, I don't mind if you enjoy the festivities.  
**Yume:** Okay! Just leave the patrolling to me~. Which stand should I go eat at first~?  
**Yume:** Onee-sans, what do you want to go see?  
**Yomi:** There's nothing I want to see in particular.  
**Maki:** Can't we just go around seeing whatever you're interested in, Yume?  
**Yume:** But we're all here at a festival? You have to have a good time too! So think about it harder, okay?  
**Yume:** Ah, that one over there looks good-! I'll be right back!  
**Suzuka:** She's been caught up in the festival spirit before we even started.  
**Yomi:** She said she had gone together with her parents when she was younger.  
**Maki:** ...I see. In that case... I guess there's no helping it then.  
**Maki:** Hm? Something's causing a commotion over that way.  
**Festival Prepping Toji:** I-I have a report to make...!  
**Yukari:** What is it?  
**Festival Prepping Toji:** Aradama seem to have stolen the paper lanterns we used as decorations! We ourselves spotted several aradama fleeing with lanterns caught on them...!  
**Yukari:** Aradama are taking the lanterns? What's the meaning of this?  
**Festival Prepping Toji:** I'm not sure, but... The aradama with the lanterns are just marching around the festival area, so it doesn't seem like there's been any serious damage caused yet.  
**Yukari:** Hm... It's a bizarre case, but we can hardly hold the festival if there are aradama here.  
**Maki:** Yukari-sama, with the help of the toji on patrol, we will clear out these aradama and recover the stolen lanterns.  
**Yukari:** Good then; include investigating these aradama as part of your mission, and see it done.  
**Maki:** Yes ma'am!  
**Yume:** We all came to the festival, so I don't want any aradama going and ruining it!  
**Yume:** Though, won't it be really annoying getting the lanterns back?  
**Yomi:** Without the lanterns, the festival's atmosphere will be spoiled. The pleasant mood of the festival is its greatest charm.  
**Yume:** Well, if Yomi-onee-san says so, then I'll try not to break the lanterns.  
**Yume:** Come on, let's go take care of this fast.  
**Maki:** ...Wait, don't go on your own!  
**Suzuka:** I'll guide the civilians away from here and reunite with you later. Yomi-san, please support the two of them.  
**Yomi:** Understood. Then, Yukari-sama... I will be going now.  
**Yukari:** Right, best of luck.  

## 2: Sharing the Festival with Everyone!
**Yukari:** Excellent work, not only with suppressing the aradama, but also with directing the other toji. With your efforts, the situation was put under control before much harm could be done.  
**Yomi:** The paper lanterns were safely recovered as well. It may have been delayed half an hour, but the festival should be ready to open shortly.  
**Yume:** The festival~, the festival~.  
**Yomi:** It seems it's started.  
**Yume:** Then, let's go-!  
**Yukari:** Wait, Yume.  
**Yume:** Ehh... But you said I could look around the festival before~.  
**Yukari:** I have here yukata for the four of you. Once you've changed, you may enjoy the festival to the fullest.  
**Yume:** Wow! Now it really feels like a festival!! Thanks, Yukari-sama!  
**Yukari:** That's right. You should thank Yuzuki... Ayanokouji's president. She's the one who prepared these.  
**Yume:** Okay! Anyway, I'm gonna go change!  
**Suzuka:** We should follow along with her.  
**Maki:** We can't exactly ignore this offer, after all.  
**Yume:** This takoyaki is yummy! Yomi-onee-san, I'll give you a bite too, eat up.  
**Yomi:** Thank you... Ohm, mm, it's a little hot... Though it is tasty.  
**Yume:** I told you~. I think it's even better than the takoyaki I usually have?  
**Suzuka:** Fufu... On top of shaved ice and chocolate bananas, they're offering buttered potatoes as well.  
**Maki:** Suzuka. This came up when you were looking at the food stalls around New Year's, but is buttered potato one of your favorites?  
**Suzuka:** That's right. I don't often get to sample them, so the moment I do see them, I always want to have a taste.  
**Yume:** Ah, you can scoop for goldfish there! Can I try that?  
**Yukari:** Fine, go on.  
**Yume:** You better watch, okay~? I'm gonna catch a whole bunch of them!  
**Yume:** Geez, why can't I catch a single goldfish~!?  
**Yomi:** If you shout so loudly, you'll alert the goldfish.  
**Yume:** But they keep swimming away as soon as I try! Hey hey, onee-sans, show me how to do it-.  
**Suzuka:** Do your best to show her how it's done, Maki-san, Yomi-san. I will cheer you on.  
**Maki:** Hey... That's no fair, Suzuka.  
**Yomi:** Understood. I will give it a try.  
**Maki:** Kh... So Yomi's taking this seriously. Mister, give me a scoop too. If I'm going to do this, I don't want to lose.  
**Yomi:** ...Then, prepare yourself.  
**Yume:** Yomi-onee-san... How'd you get so good at scooping goldfish!? The old guy running the stall looked like he was gonna cry halfway through.  
**Yukari:** Indeed... That's quite the haul. I was surprised as well.  
**Yomi:** I may have overdone it. So I made sure to return some of them.  
**Maki:** Why... couldn't I catch a single one...?  
**Suzuka:** Everyone has their strengths and weaknesses. You excel at so many other things, Maki-san.  
**Yukari:** Suzuka...  
**Yomi:** You seemed to want these goldfish, Tsubakuro-san, but are you going to look after them?  
**Yume:** Can I!?  
**Yomi:** Though, festival goldfish live very short lives. Will you keep them regardless?  
**Yume:** Hmmm. Even if that's true, since you caught them for me, I'll let them live for a really long time!  
**Yukari:** It seems the fireworks have begun.  
**Yume:** Woww-, they're so pretty-!  
**Suzuka:** Yes, they truly are...  
**Maki:** TAMAYA-!  
**Yume:** What's that?  
**Maki:** It's something you're supposed to shout when fireworks are going off, though I'm not really sure why.  
**Yume:** Huh, I didn't know!  
**Yume:** TA-MAYA-! This is kinda fun!  
**Yume:** I hope we get to see the fireworks together again next year-.  
**Yume:** Ah! We can all set off fireworks together next time!  
**Maki:** Fireworks, huh. It's been a while since I did them myself.  
**Suzuka:** It wouldn't have quite the same atmosphere as this, but it sounds highly entertaining.  
**Yukari:** So long as you take proper caution with the fire, I'll allow it.  
**Yume:** You'll allow it... But you'll be doing it with us, Yukari-sama?  
**Yukari:** I will?  
**Yume:** We're making a promise!  
**Yume:** Pinky swear, and whoever lies, they get a needle in their eye~!
