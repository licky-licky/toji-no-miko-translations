The Five Traditions Unified School...</h1><h2 id="1-the-unified-school-festival-executive-committee" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>1: The Unified School Festival Executive Committee</h2><p><strong>Yume:</strong> Whoa, this classroom's full of people!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> All student members of the executive committee have assembled here.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> That's right. We should get this meeting started straight away.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Members of the executive committee, thank you all for gathering today to discuss the Five Traditions Unified School Festival. I'm Shidou Maki, filling the role of committee chairman.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> I, Konohana Suzuka, am assistant executive committee chairman. Everyone, let's work together to create a wonderful festival.<br><strong>Students:</strong> Yes!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> (What do I do... I wasn't thinking, so I thought "Joining the school festival's executive committee sounds exciting!", but now...)<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> (This feels like it could be a much more serious job...)<br><strong>Maki:</strong> To begin with, we need to settle on which activities the school festival will be performing. Does anyone have any ideas they'd like to propose?<br><strong>Students:</strong> ......<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Nobody...?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> It takes courage to be the first to state your opinion. Perhaps we should begin by offering our own proposals?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Good point. Then, I'll start with my idea. With toji from every school gathered here, why don't we hold a tournament that decides the strongest of them all?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ooh, let's do that, let's do that! It sounds fun!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Right?<br><strong>Female Student A:</strong> <em>whispering</em> Wait, but then it sounds like non-toji students don't get to do anything...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Maki-san, Yume. That would be no different from the official yearly tournament.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Er, you have a point...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Coming up with an idea for the festival is harder than it seems. What do you think, Suzuka?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Let's see... Since it is a festival after all, why not hold a formal dress party?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Along with that, it would be nice to invite an orchestra to perform a classical concert for us.<br><strong>Female Student B:</strong> <em>whispering</em> What does a formal party have to do with a school festival...<br><strong>Female Student C:</strong> <em>whispering</em> A classical concert is gonna put people to sleep...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> That's way too serious, Suzuka onee-san! It just sounds boring!<br><strong>Yume:</strong> We should do a swordfighting tournament after all-! Everyone from the Five Traditions is gonna be there anyway~!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Hmmm... Yomi, why don't you tell us what you think?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> In my case... I have no preference when it comes to the subject of the school festival.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> But, I think it's necessary we consider in advance what kind of aradama countermeasures to prepare.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> ......<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> What's wrong, Maki-san?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> ...Nothing, I just remembered a request that President Hashima and President Gojou asked of me.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> What'd those old ladies want?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> They said "When it comes to the Five Traditions unified school festival, be sure to keep it student appropriate and do something everyone attending can enjoy."<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Thinking on the "student appropriate" part, our suggestions have been somewhat off, haven't they.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> But what should we do...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Um...<br><strong>Maki:</strong> What is it? Musumi Kiyoka. If you have a proposal, speak up and share it.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Y-Yes!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Um... I'm not sure if my ideas will be any good, but...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Don't be shy, tell everyone.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Uh... We could all wear cute matching dresses, and work at a maid cafe?<br><strong>Female Student D:</strong> Huh... Well that's better than a swordfighting tournament or a classical concert.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> And then... We could get the girls who are good at singing and dancing together, and have a live show on stage!<br><strong>Female Student A:</strong> That could work! I've always wanted to be a part of a girl band!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> And also, all the students from all the schools could do a beauty pageant!<br><strong>Female Student B:</strong> Sounds like fun! My girl's better looking than most, you know.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> That's surprising... They were so quiet before, but now they're all joining in.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah... I'm sorry! I'm talking too much, aren't I.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Not at all. Your ideas seem to be quite popular.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Everyone, what do you think about using her suggestions?<br><strong>Students:</strong> WE APPROVE-!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> (Thank goodness. I think I managed to help out.)  </p><h2 id="2-distribution-of-roles" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>2: Distribution of Roles</h2><p><strong>Maki:</strong> Okay, now we have a general idea of what activities we'll be doing during the festival. To continue, we should assign everyone's positions.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Members of the executive committee will be responsible for different roles on the day of the school festival. If there's a position you want, you can go ahead and claim it...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> In that case, why not let Musumi-san, who came up with those great suggestions, choose the role she wants first.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> N-No, I couldn't! I'd be fine helping with any position! The maid cafe, the beauty pageant, or the live stage, I'll do my best to help wherever you need me to!<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Musumi-san, are you sure about that?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Yes. There's so many things I want to do that it's hard to pick just one... I know! To keep things fair, why don't we use a lottery to decide?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Understood. If that's how you want it, we'll do it.<br>After drawing the lottery--</p><p><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Aww...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> (I said I'd do my best at anything, but I didn't think I'd draw the most boring one...)<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> (Security duty patrolling the neighborhood. Which means, I have to be standing around far away from the actual festival...)<br><strong>Maki:</strong> How did it come to this... Why am I assigned to the maid cafe?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> What are the chances, that's my position too. And Yume and Yomi's as well.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> There's gonna be lots of guests coming to the maid cafe, right? Since they're all coming from the Five Traditions, that means there could be strong girls in there too! I wanna fight them already!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yume... A maid cafe is no place to be starting fights.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> ...<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ......<br><strong>Yume:</strong> What's with you two?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Does this mean I'll have to be serving guests in a maid uniform...?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> It's nothing... The lottery's outcome has me slightly shocked...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I know what you mean. It was a bit of a shock for me too, being on the security team...<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ...Musumi-san, I have a proposal. You could trade duties with me.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Eh, you don't have to go that far!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> I see, I hadn't considered that... If I could be on the security team instead, then I'd rather...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Maki-san, Yomi. You can't always go around expecting to only do security work.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> I know, but... I can't be a maid...<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I'd be better suited patrolling the area than serving guests...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh, then I want to be doing that too!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Hold it right there! We of the elite guard have been entrusted to supervise and manage this entire school festival.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> So don't you think it would be wrong to have three of us patrolling outside the school grounds?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ...When you say it that way, it's difficult not to agree...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Unless something urgent happens, the elite guard should remain inside the school grounds.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> It's like you said... Yomi, I think we should try to do the duties the lottery gave us, but what do you think?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ...I understand. Whatever task I'm given, I will do everything in my power to carry out.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> (...It's disappointing, but I'll try to do my best on patrol too...)  </p><h2 id="3-grand-opening-the-five-traditions-unified-school-festival" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>3: Grand Opening! The Five Traditions Unified School Festival</h2><p>On the day of the Five Traditions Unified School Festival--</p><p><strong>Maki:</strong> There's more guests than I expected. I knew the executive committee would be busy, but can they handle this...?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Everyone's putting in a good effort. You too, Maki-san. When you have the time, feel free to take a break. You must be tired; you were running around all morning.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> This much is nothing for me... Or I'd like to say that, but this is too different from the duties I'm used to. I don't want to make any mistakes, so I'll rest while I can.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Hey, hey, aren't you onee-sans gonna be maids too?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> It isn't our shift yet.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Though, Yume. Aren't you supposed to be serving at the cafe right now? Want to explain why you're out here still in your usual uniform?<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Boo. It's no fun there if you and Suzuka onee-san aren't gonna come!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Still, we decided that it was your duty to be there right now. You have to stick to the schedule. Go on, hurry up back to the cafe.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Fiiine.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Alright, next they need me as an announcer on stage. Starting in three minutes. If I hurry, I can make it in time.<br>At that time, outside the school festival grounds--</p><p><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Sigh... I know security is important and all... But am I really going to miss the whole festival standing out here...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> The band should be playing up on stage right about now. That must be so exciting...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Huh? Kiyoka?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> What are you doing out here?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Hono-chan! And you too, Setouchi-san. Why are you here?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> The crepe stand we're managing ran out of ingredients, so we had to run out and buy more.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> You should come check it out later, Kiyoka. Chii-nee makes some super yummy crepes!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I wish I could go, but... I'm busy with my duties.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> That's right, you're on the executive committee, aren't you? You must have a lot of responsibilities.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Yes, it's my job today to patrol the perimeter of the school festival.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Oh, really? Sorry, we had no idea and came up and bothered you...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> No, don't worry about it!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> But Hono-chan, you should get going. Everyone's waiting for you to bring back those ingredients, right?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah... Then, I'll see you later, Kiyoka.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Have a good time.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Sigh... Now I'm alone again.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That crepe stand sounds like fun... The maid cafe must be busy too...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Huh? Someone's calling.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It's from Shidou-san! Why would she call me...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Hello, this is executive committee member Musumi Kiyoka, on patrol. What do you need from me?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> An emergency came up. Musumi Kiyoka, return to the school as fast as possible.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Eh-, what happened...?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> I'll explain the details after you arrive. Come quickly.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> She hung up... What sort of emergency do they need me for?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah... Does that mean aradama appeared in the festival!?  
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I have to get back there!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Pant... Pant... Musumi Kiyoka, is here.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Good, you're here already. Something unexpected came up.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Yes, please tell me what happened!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Right, actually... The maid cafe is a runaway success, and we're severely understaffed there...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Eh...?  </p><h2 id="4-the-school-festival-i-dreamt-of" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>4: The School Festival I Dreamt Of</h2><p><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> The maid cafe... Is understaffed? Then, why did you call me here...?<br><strong>Maki:</strong> I'm sorry to ask this suddenly, but I want you to change positions to serving at the maid cafe.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Y-You want me to be a maid?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yes. We've decided to reassign 10% of the security team to the maid cafe. And you're one of them.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Your uniform has already been prepared for you. Once you're ready, begin standing in the hall and helping guests.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Um... But then, will there be enough people helping security?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> You shouldn't be concerned with that. In place of the ones reassigned, I will become part of the security team.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Just by yourself, Satsuki-san...?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Extensive search and lookout assignments are my specialty.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> If that's all, I'll go to my post.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah... Satsuki-san, she left...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Is it really okay, letting Satsuki-san handle that much by herself?<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Of course. Interacting with the guests was leaving Yomi fairly worn out.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> We decided it would be a better use of their talents putting people in roles they're more accustomed to.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Musumi Kiyoka. I'd like for you to start working in your new position straight away.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah... Understood! Of course I will!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> (I can't believe I get to serve guests at the maid cafe! I'm so glad I tried the executive committee!)  
<strong>Passing Guest:</strong> Excuse me, I want to go to the maid cafe. Can you tell me which way it is?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> In that case, I'll guide you there, master!<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Musumi-san immediately understands how to win a guest's heart. Having them switch positions was the right idea after all.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> Agreed. Everyone has something they're better cut out for.<br>And like that, the school festival finished without incident--</p><p><strong>Maki:</strong> So it's already time to shut it down. I'm glad everything went smoothly.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Because of my reassignment, I was also able to fulfill my duties until the end. Thank you very much.<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> We received nothing but praise from both our guests and the presidents. Job well done, everyone.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It's a little sad, saying goodbye already...<br><strong>Yume:</strong> You looked like you were having a lot of fun being a maid, Onee-san!<br><strong>Maki:</strong> That's for sure. Even I was hearing about the reputation you built up among the guests.<br><strong>Maki:</strong> From helping with the preparations, to working security, to even serving guests, having you around was a huge relief. Thanks.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You don't have to go that far... I just wanted to have a good time with everyone...<br><strong>Suzuka:</strong> Everything turned out so well in part thanks to those feelings. I'd like to thank you as well, Musumi-san.<br><strong>Yume:</strong> Yeah, you helped me out a lot too! Thanks, Onee-san!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Hearing that from all of you...
