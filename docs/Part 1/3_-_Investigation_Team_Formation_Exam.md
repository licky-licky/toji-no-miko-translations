## 1: The President, the Akabane Swords, and the Girl with No Presence
**Mihono:** President Ema...?  
**Chie:** Ah... I'm sorry for not contacting you, President Hashima. While I was with her, Mihono-san... I'm very sorry.  
**Ema:** Sigh... Asakura-san, Setouchi-san, to raise your swords against the elite guard... You two have really done it this time.  
**Ema:** What Etou-san did was bad enough, but you what you two did can only be considered treason as well. Ordinarily, you'd be lucky just to have your okatana confiscated.  
**Mihono:** I'm sorry... Uh... So we're really... Going to lose our okatana?  
**Ema:** Ordinarily, that is.  
**Chie:** Excuse me, but, has my... Has Osafune's president said anything?  
**Ema:** Setouchi-san, I've spoken to Sana. She's asked me to take care of you. So please follow my instructions.  
**Chie:** I understand.  
**Ema:** Now then, the two of you will be undergoing a change in assignment. Both of you are to take part in an investigation team that is being assembled.  
**Chie:** ...Understood!  
**Mihono:** Ah, uh, understood! ...So what are we investigating?  
**Ema:** The Akabane swords.  
**Mihono:** The rusty okatana that sometimes pop out when you kill an aradama?  
**Chie:** In the post-war period... The American military tried to move five to ten thousand okatana overseas. But, while transporting them, the ship sank while in the seas around Urakawa. All those okatana were ultimately lost...   
**Chie:** At the time, they were completely unable to recover them. However, in recent years, they've been found coming out of the bodies of defeated aradama.  
**Chie:** ...That about sums it up, right, President Hashima?  
**Mihono:** Chii-nee, you're like a walking wikipedia!  
**Chie:** Mihono-chan...? This is common knowledge?  
**Mihono:** (Humming~)  
**Ema:** It seems Asakura-san needs to study a little harder.  
**Ema:** Setting that aside, in recent years, the number of aradama incidents in the center of the Kanto region have greatly increased. The reason behind this is thought to be what's known as the Akabane swords.  
**Ema:** Now, in this case, the presidents of the Five Traditions have been given permission to supervise a special joint task force investigating the Akabane swords.  
**Ema:** Normally I'd give you a choice here, but with your crimes the two of you really have no option but to participate.  
**Ema:** There's no problem with that, is there?  
**Chie:** Of course not!  
**Mihono:** We'll do it! ...So, President Ema, who's that girl?  
**Chie:** What... Girl?  
**Ema:** Hm...? Ah... I'm so sorry, I completely forgot. Let's see, this is Heijou Institute's Musumi Kiyoka-san.  
**Ema:** She's the toji that Heijou Institute's president Gojou Iroha is providing for the investigation team.  
**Kiyoka:** Ah, um...... Pleased to, meet you.  
**Mihono:** (U-Uh... She... She's got no presence at all, does she!?)  

## 2: Aptitude Test (1)
One of The Five Traditions under the Origami Family, Renpu Girl's School--

  
**Mihono:** (The Origami family estate is practically next door... I had no idea Renpu was this close to them... I guess why they call it the Origami family's right hand, huh.)  
**Yukina:** Hmph...ã€€So these girls are the pawns Minoseki, Osafune, and Heijou have to offer?  
**Ema:** Yukina? These girls are fully qualified toji. Don't you think it's a bit harsh calling them pawns?  
**Ema:** While you might be fine just staying on the director... On Yukari-sama's good side, you know you're not making any friends with that attitude, right?  
**Yukina:** Tsk... Well, it doesn't matter. Just do your best not to hold back my Kofuki. Kofuki!  
**Kofuki:** Yo...! Oh! Well if it ain't Mihono and boobies!  
**Chie:** Boo... I have a name, you know. I'm Setouchi Chie.  
**Kofuki:** So I was right! Since you're Chichie, and all. (chichi means boobs if you can't pick up on that)  
**Chie:** Wha...  
**Mihono:** Ah! Shichinosato-san! Short time no see!  
**Kofuki:** You don't have to call me Shichinosato-san. Kofuki's fine. Fukki's good too?  
**Mihono:** Then, Kofuki-san, I guess.  
**Kofuki:** That's no fun, but whatever works.  
**Kiyoka:** Um, nice to meet you...  
**Kofuki:** Doesn't matter who I'm grouped up with anyway. So long as I get to cut up some aradama...  
**Kiyoka:** Um! I'm Musumi Kiyoka, from the Heijou Institute!  
**Kofuki:** Whoa, when'd you get here?  
**Kiyoka:** That's rude! I've been here from the start!  
**Mihono:** (Ahaha...)  
**Yukina:** ...So, Minoseki President. Since Ayanokouji's pawn is running late, we have a bit of spare time. Why not test these girls to see who's really worthy of this position?  
**Ema:** A test? You don't get to decide that on your own... These girls are the ones Iroha-san and Sana carefully entrusted to us...  
**Yukina:** Carefully? You can't be serious...!  
**Yukina:** Operator! Prepare the equipment testing room for a mock battle practical exam. In ten minutes I want that room filled with small grade aradama!  
**Renpu Student:** Understood, President!  

## 3: Aptitude Test (2)
**Yukina:** See! Isn't my Kofuki overwhelmingly superior? In comparison, Osafune's Setouchi Chie is painfully average, and your Asakura Mihono seems to be buckling under the pressure.  
**Yukina:** Heijou's Musumi Kiyoka is a complete dead weight; she isn't even fighting!  
**Yukina:** Ahh~! Let me make the difference even clearer! Operator! Prepare medium grade aradama. Hurry and raise the pace!  
**Ema:** Yukina! At this rate, even your Kofuki-san is going to get hurt. You can't keep this up...  
**Yukina:** Shut up. My Kofuki is a tool for fighting aradama. That's how I raised her, and, while you might not understand, that's what makes her happy!  
**Yukina:** Just watch!  

## 4: Aptitude Test (3)
**Kiyoka:** I-I don't want to do this anymore... I thought we were just meeting up; why do we have to fight-!?  
**Kiyoka:** Were't we just going to investigate... Kyaa!  
**Chie:** What are you thinking, President Takatsu!? This isn't a test, this is a real battle!  
**Yukina:** Don't question me.  
**Yukina:** As pawns in the service of Yukari-sama, isn't it only natural to test whether you can be useful pawns or just plain fodder?  
**Yukina:** Get back in there and fight.  
**Chie:** We won't...!  
**Mihono:** Chii-nee, we can handle this. This is our chance, I think. If we get to the bottom of the Akabane swords, there'll be less aradama, won't there?  
**Mihono:** That means that, with our okatana, that we have to be skilled enough to protect everyone, doesn't it? So...  
**Mihono:** Where there's a will, there's a way, right!  
**Chie:** ...Nn, you're right, Mihono-chan. Okay, let's get through this.  
**Chie:** Kiyoka-san. You just get behind me. You don't have to force yourself to fight, okay?  
**Kiyoka:** A-Ah, but... I... Um... Ah... Okay...  
**Kofuki:** Shuttup, this is my playground! If you're not gonna fight, then just get out of here! ...Actually, you two can get out too.  
**Kofuki:** I only need me and my cute aradama-chan to have a good time! So bring it on! Fufu, I love you, aradama-chan!  

## 5: Aptitude Test (4)
**Kofuki:** What's wrong, prez! It's not over, right? Gimme more! I'll slaughter 'em all!  
**Yukina:** Fufu, whatever you want, Kofuki. Operator, prepare the next wave of aradama...  
**Ema:** That's far enough, Yukina! You too, operator. This ends here!  
**Yukina:** Minoseki President...! Don't interfere!  
**Ema:** I can't stand to watch any more. Yukina, do you think the director... Do you think Yukari would be happy if she saw this?  
**Yukina:** ! How dare you...  
**Ema:** Yukina...?  
**Yukina:** What could you understand about Yukari-sama... About Onee-sama! I'm the one who knows her best... Who comprehends her! ...Hey! Operator!  
**Renpu Student:** ...Uh, yes!  
**Yukina:** ...dama...to.........on the double, got it?  
**Renpu Studen:** But... There are still students... In the area...  
**Yukina:** Just do it.  
**Ema:** Yukina...  

## 6: Who's Interrupting Our Departure?
**Kofuki:** Seriously!? That's it!? Don't give me that! I know you've got more aradama! Bring on dessert!  
**Mihono:** Huh... Did we do it? ...Oh yeah! Did we pass, President Ema!?  
**Ema:** Seems like it. You made it through, though honestly your teamwork could use improvement. I can't say I'm too satisfied with all this.  
*alarms flash*

  
**Announcer:** [Confirmed sighting of multiple aradama trespassing on the western end of the campus.]  
**Ema:** The campus...? What does that mean? Why would aradama be... I don't believe it.  
**Ema:** (...! You didn't, did you, Yukina!? Even for you, this is...)  
**Mihono:** President! We'll take care of it! I'm pretty sure we can get there faster than anyone right now! Let's go, Musumi-san!  
**Kiyoka:** Eh? I-I'm going too...?  
**Mihono:** Of course! Come on! You too, Kofuki-san!  
**Chie:** Shichinosato-san already ran off ahead!  
**Mihono:** Ehh!? We have to hurry, Chii-nee! Bye, President Ema!  

## 7: Mirja Touchdown (1)
**Chie:** Shichinosato-san! Don't push too far ahead! Mihono-chan! You're losing focus; fall back for now! Just stay behind me, Kiyoka-chan!  
**Chie:** (What should I do... I have to keep everyone safe, but I can't keep up with them all...!)  
**Mihono:** Look out, Musumi-san!  
**Chie:** (Oh no, Kiyoka-chan...!? I only took my eyes off her for a moment...!)  
**Aradama:** GRRRRUUUU...!  
**Kiyoka:** KYAA! S-Stay back! Don't come near me! Go away!  
*slash*

  
**Aradama:** GYUUUUUN!  
*dead aradama*

  
**Kiyoka:** Pant... Pant... I don't want... To do this anymore...  
**Chie:** Thank goodness, she's safe...  
**Chie:** (Kiyoka-chan managed to take care of that one... But, any more than this... I can't count on Kiyoka-chan to keep fighting in this condition!)  
*helicopter sounds*

  
**Chie:** A helicopter-!? Who's dropping in at a time like this...?  
**Mirja:** What are you doing!? The enemy's numbers aren't so great! If you want to defeat them, just do as I say! This will be over in 5 minutes!  
**Chie:** Who's that...!?  
**Mirja:** Introductions can come later! Minoseki! Renpu is too far forward, stick close behind her right side and support her!  
**Mihono:** Uh, okay...!  
**Mirja:**  Osafune! Move forward and hold off the aradama on the left! Just hold them off; you don't have to kill them!  
**Chie:** I-I'm on it!  
**Mirja:** Heijou!  
**Kiyoka:** Ah- Y-Y-Yes!?  
**Mirja:** You hang back! Any aradama the other three let through are yours to finish off! Prioritize the ones already weakened!  
**Kiyoka:** I-I'll try!  
**Chie:** (Who is she? She seems so experienced... No, I can't think about that now. Getting through this is all that matters!)  

## 8: Mirja Touchdown (2)
**Chie:** Thank you, you saved us. I don't know how that fight would have turned out under my instructions...  
**Mirja:** No, think nothing of it. I see, so you all are the other members of the investigation team?  
**Mirja:** I'm very sorry for my late arrival. Allow me to introduce myself.  
**Mirja:** My name is Kitora Mirja. As you can tell by my uniform, I'm a 2nd year in Ayanokouji Martial Arts School's high school division.  
**Mirja:** Back in Kyoto, I served as a captain of the Special Ritual Riot Squad. For this mission, I have been ordered by my president to work together with you.  
**Mirja:** Please take care of me.  
**Mihono:** That's our line; you took care of us! In fact, you sound a lot softer now that you're not shouting orders. I was really surprised!  
**Mirja:** Yes, in the middle of an operation, getting information out quickly and decisively is essential. If you had to ask me, I prefer acting more like this though.  
**Kiyoka:** U-Um... The role you gave me, it wasn't so scary. So, thank you very much.  
**Kofuki:** Yeah. After you showed up, I really got to go wild!  
**Mirja:** Thank you very much. Now then... If it's alright with you all, would you please share with me your names and profiles?  
**Mihono:** Sure, gladly!  

## 9: Let's go! ...To Where?
-The next morning they set out together--

  
**Mirja:** Setouchi Chie-san, just to confirm with you... The subject of our investigation is finding the source of the Akabane swords, suspected to be the cause of numerous aradama incidents. That's correct, isn't it?  
**Chie:** Right. And so, why don't we head into Tokyo first? If only as a starting destination.  
**Kofuki:** Huh? Shouldn't we get out of the Kamakura area? Like up where those Yanks were when their ship sank?  
**Chie:** You're not wrong, but... From what the Five Traditions already looked into, they weren't able to find a single okatana near Urakawa where the ship was supposed to have sank.  
**Kofuki:** So that's why we're stuck with Tokyo?  
**Mihono:** Tokyo...??? Why Tokyo?  
**Mirja:** Where to begin... As I'm sure you're aware, Asakura Mihono-san, aradama are created when noro gathers together.  
**Mihono:** Ah, yeah. I know that much.  
**Mirja:** Generally, noro is incapable of binding with inorganic matter. However, okatana have proven to be an exception... Or rather, even though noro cannot properly bind with an okatana, there have still been cases of noro drawing them in.  
**Mirja:** Putting it simply, under ordinary circumstances, noro is not attracted to okatana. The only exceptions have been... As you might have guessed, the rusted okatana.  
**Chie:** Also known as the Akabane swords. You know how we've been retrieving okatana that were encased in aradama.  
**Mirja:** However... Don't you find this whole situation strange? Ordinarily, an okatana should be incapable of rusting or being broken. So why are they rusted, and why are they found inside of aradama?  
**Mirja:** In the first place... Are they being rusted because the noro took them in, or did the noro take them in because they were already rusted? There have been attempts at researching the matter, but there are too many unnatural elements.  
**Mihono:** Hmmm... But with my okatana... With Kashuu Kiyomitsu, the tip is broken off...?  
**Mirja:** That's... Extremely interesting... No, leaving that aside for now...  
**Mirja:** From that reasoning, there's a belief amongst the Five Traditions that the Akabane swords may have been subject to some form of unnatural processing, and intentionally scattered by someone.  
**Chie:** ...Anyway, due to our lack of information, our best lead at this point is to head to Tokyo. That's where the most sightings of Akabane swords within aradama have happened.  
**Mihono:** I get it... So, where in Tokyo are we going?  
**Kofuki:** Huh? Wherever there's aradama-chan to kill, of course.  
**Mirja:** While it's nice to be enthusiastic, that isn't our goal. First, we should stop by the local branch office. From there, we can ask for records from across the past few years...  
**Kofuki:** That sounds lame as hell-!  
**Chie:** We don't have a choice though. There's no other leads...  
**Kiyoka:** ......Harajuku.  
**Kofuki:** Huh!?  
**Kiyoka:** W-We should go... To Harajuku, I think.  
**Mihono:** Mm, Harajuku. That place is cool... Wait, huh!?  
**Kofuki:** Are you an idiot!?  
**Mirja:** Coming from the same Kansai region as you, I can't help but want to visit as well but... We can't be sightseeing on the job, Musumi Kiyoka-san.  
**Chie:** She's right, Kiyoka-chan. Besides, Shibuya is better for more adult fashion!  
**Kofuki:** You too!!
