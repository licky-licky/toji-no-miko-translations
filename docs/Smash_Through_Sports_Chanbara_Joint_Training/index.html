Mai-chan, do you know?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Since they&#x27;ve gathered up students from all the Five Traditions, maybe it&#x27;s some kind of practice drill? Ah, Shidou-san came out.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> This may be sudden, but we&#x27;ve decided to use this period of your summer vacation to improve your command of tactics.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Given the nature of this exercise, non-toji students who are involved in operations planning will also be participating.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> With that out of the way, the subject of this training exercise is sports chanbara. I&#x27;ll now explain the rules and rewards.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> You will randomly assigned to team of five, and designated to fight one other team. The winning team will be given complimentary pool tickets.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Mai-chan, we get to go to the pool! Let&#x27;s try real hard!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Regardless of who wins or loses, it would be nice to all go have some fun together there. It&#x27;s our summer vacation, after all.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah, that sounds good! But, if we&#x27;re competing, I really do want to win.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Mm. I know what you mean!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> The basic rule is &quot;You can hit anywhere, but get hit anywhere and you&#x27;re out.&quot; Since non-toji students will be participating, you won&#x27;t be using okatana, but these foam swords instead.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Also, the use of the combat abilities utsushi, jin&#x27;i, kongoushin, hachimanriki, and of course the sensory abilities myougan and toukaku, are banned as well.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> You&#x27;re free to fight your opposing team fair and square, or sweep them with a surprise attack. It&#x27;s up to whatever plan your team decides on.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Victory goes to whichever team has less members eliminated by strike out when the time limit is reached.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> However, if a team with a non-toji member is able to protect them until they end, that person will be worth double.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> That about does it explaining the point of the excercise.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Now then, I will provide some additional information to Maki-san&#x27;s explanation.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Unlike ordinary sports chanbara, you will not be limited to a specified court, but only required to stay in sighting range of your allies.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Also, if either of the team&#x27;s leaders do not notify the administrators by message at the start of a battle, the battle will not be recognized as official.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> We need to be able to start your fifteen minute time limit.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Lastly, students who are struck out will be forbidden from offering advice or other assistance. Right now, the rules that Maki-san and I have gone over are being sent to your phones, so please examine them at your own leisure.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> In a few minutes, the team assignments should also be messaged to you. Group up, and be ready for the training exercise to begin in one hour.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Hiyori-chan, Iwakura-san, Mihono-chan, Tsugumi-san, and myself. I think our team has a nice balance to it.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> With this formation of members, I can work as a support. I should be most useful that way.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I&#x27;m so glad-, it&#x27;s all people I know!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I think you&#x27;d be able to get along well with just about anybody though, Mihono-chan.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> I&#x27;ve never really gotten a chance to do these sort of team battles with Juujou-san, but I&#x27;m looking forward to it.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Yeah, it&#x27;s reassuring being on your team, Iwakura-san.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Then, why don&#x27;t we decide on a strategy, or plan of action for our team.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> We get to fight all sorts of toji in these team battles... I wish we could do this kind of practice every month!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> You really look like you&#x27;re enjoying yourself, Kanamin. It all starts in another thirty minutes, so let&#x27;s have a strategy meeting.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Okay. Since it&#x27;s an encounter battle, it&#x27;d be great if we had a way to know what kind of movements our opponents will be making.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> This was explained earlier, but protecting the students who are not toji is critical.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> As one of them, what are your thoughts on that point, Mizushina Kinuka?<br>
<strong>Kinuka:</strong> Before we get to that, let me give a little introduction. I&#x27;m Mizushina Kinuka, a third year in Ayanokouji&#x27;s high school division. I normally work at the STT headquarters as a strategic staff officer.<br>
<strong>Kinuka:</strong> I&#x27;m not sure I can help much with the fighting itself, but I&#x27;ll do what I can. I think if I move along with you, it&#x27;ll be useful for reference in the future. Oh, and by the way, I&#x27;m a friend of Mirja&#x27;s.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Good to have you aboard, Kinuka.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Nice to meet you-!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Don&#x27;t you worry about having to fight, Kinuka-san. I, Yamashiro Yui, will lay my life on the line to see you unharmed!<br>
<strong>Kinuka:</strong> Thank you, Yamashiro-san. So anyway, about what Mirja asked before--  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="2-the-feeling-of-a-serious-battle"></a>2: The Feeling of a Serious Battle!<a class="hash-link" href="#2-the-feeling-of-a-serious-battle" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Stage Directions:</strong> Somewhere in Kanagawa prefecture-- Two teams are in the midst of battle.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Kofuki-chan-- We&#x27;ve already gotten started fighting Itomi-san and Kaoru-san&#x27;s team. Please get your foam swords ready!<br>
<strong>Fujimaki Minaki:</strong> That&#x27;s right, Kofukicchi. It&#x27;s a team battle, so if you don&#x27;t help us out, we&#x27;re done for.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Some aradama-chan&#x27;d be better than whacking each other with these squishy things... You guys&#x27;ll manage.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Kaoru, do you not want to go to the pool?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> I do, but... Practice, work, manual labor... The moment I start thinking about those, my body gets too heavy to move... Sorry, Sayaka.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> But, I&#x27;ll be cheering you on. You can do it-, Sayaka-.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> I understand. I&#x27;ll try to do it...<br>
<strong>Uraga Nao:</strong> You&#x27;re fine with that, Itomi-san!?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Tch... Getting my ass kicked for nothing by Sayaka would be annoying too... Chichie, I&#x27;ll pin her down.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> Okay! ...Hey, and my name isn&#x27;t Chichie!<br>
<strong>Nao:</strong> Mashiko-san, you get in formation too~... I&#x27;m begging you~.<br>
<strong>Kinuka:</strong> Let&#x27;s review our strategy while we move. The basic aim is to protect me until we reach the time limit.<br>
<strong>Kinuka:</strong> Naturally, if we can have our talented fighter, Etou-san, keep up a relentless attack and match our opponent&#x27;s offensive, I think it will likely lead to our victory.<br>
<strong>Kinuka:</strong> But it will mean you&#x27;ll end up taking on multiple enemies.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I&#x27;m not too sure about that, so I&#x27;ll have to think a lot about how to attack.<br>
<strong>Kinuka:</strong> We could also try gambling on a riskier strategy, like using me as bait so you can eliminate those who attack me. That might be effective if the enemy is hiding.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> But, the penalties are way too big if we lose you, Kinuka. It&#x27;s better to keep you safe. That&#x27;s twice the points for us.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Yep, keeping cute girls safe-- That&#x27;s my mission here!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> We leave her in your hands, Yamashiro Yui. If you maintain a strong defense, it won&#x27;t be difficult overcoming a numerical disadvantage.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Kohagura Ellen and myself will of course be in the area as guards, but there will be times we have to move out to attack as well.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> We&#x27;ll be switching up our attack on the fly.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Yuiyui is in charge of protecting Kinuka. Kanamin is in charge of the offense. Let&#x27;s all make it work! If we all combine our efforts, we&#x27;ll take the win and those pool tickets before you know it!<br>
<strong>Kinuka:</strong> Remember, you aren&#x27;t fighting with okatana, so it&#x27;s one hit from these foam swords and you&#x27;re out. Please be careful.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I go it! So, what are we doing from here?<br>
<strong>Kinuka:</strong> As you might expect... We&#x27;ll go in with the element of surprise!!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ooh, you&#x27;re so aggressive, Kinuka-san!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> The opposing team we were assigned is Juujou Hiyori and Yanase Mai&#x27;s. I think that is a better strategy than waiting for them.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Let&#x27;s make like an early bird and go get the worm!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Even if she doesn&#x27;t have an okatana, Kanami-chan is sure to come at us with everything she has.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Mmhm. From looking at their members, I think Etou-san will be the one to push an attack.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Yanase-san, Juujou-san, I want to make sure with you. Will the two of you be able to take out Etou-san?<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Or, at least keep her held down?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I think we can hold her down. Right, Hiyori-chan?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Yeah. It&#x27;s just, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be used to fighting with these soft foam swords. Though, they should have the same issue.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> The moment you&#x27;re hit, you&#x27;re eliminated. You need to be careful.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Mihono, you&#x27;ll be careful, right?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Why me!? Um... I think I&#x27;ll be fine?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ahaha... I&#x27;d like to be able to go and play with Chii-nee and everyone at the pool!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> We have to win first to make that happen, don&#x27;t we...?<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Hey now, having the right motivation is important too. Isn&#x27;t it, Asakura-san?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah, that&#x27;s it! Motorbation...! I wanna win too!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I think attacking as quickly as we can before they notice us would give us the highest chance of victory, but what do you think?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Our priority target should be our senpai, the third year high schooler from Ayanokouji.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> So then, we&#x27;ll go with a surprise attack?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I want to fight Kanami fair and square, but we can do that some other time...!  Cause I want that pool ticket!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah, I spotted Mihono-chan! And Mai-chan and Hiyori-chan too!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Geh... Kanami!?  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="3-a-small-move-done-secretly"></a>3: A Small Move Done Secretly<a class="hash-link" href="#3-a-small-move-done-secretly" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Kanami:</strong> I thought I heard Mihono-chan talking, but I didn&#x27;t expect them to be this close by.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> It was so blatant that I assumed they were using Asakura Mihono as a decoy, but it seems I was wrong.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Fwhe!?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> So much for our surprise attack-. Mirja, are we okay to go?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Yes, I sent a message to the administrators that Etou Kanami has encountered the corresponding team.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> They&#x27;re messaging to start the battle...! Yanase-san?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Mihono-chan and I will go after that senpai... [whispered]<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah, sure! [whispered]<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Yamashiro Yui.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I&#x27;m already on it! Our hearts are connected, Mirja-san!<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Juujou-san, you take Etou-san. Ban-san, please back me up.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Sure thing-, I&#x27;ll be right with you.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> That&#x27;s how we&#x27;re doing it. I&#x27;ll be your opponent, Kanami.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> It&#x27;s different from a sparring match, but this is fun too! Here I come, Hiyori-chan!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> (I&#x27;ll draw Kanami away-- Good luck, you two.)<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> I&#x27;m not letting you go one step further, Maiiimai.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Ellen-chan... Are you sure Kanami-chan will be fine on her own?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Fufu. That&#x27;s a risk I&#x27;m willing to take. --HAA-!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Where do you think you&#x27;re going? Asakura Mihono.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Um, uhh... I thought I&#x27;d play with Yui a little...?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> --Hey, Mirja-san!? You&#x27;re going to attack without even saying anything!?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Mihono-chan, create some distance!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> --You&#x27;re open!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> ...!?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ahh-, two groups of girls meeting for a heated sweaty battle! I bet it smells great!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> And, out of everyone... Why are you acting like you&#x27;re just a spectator? Though, given the situation, I suppose I&#x27;m one too...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I thought I&#x27;d help you relax, Kinuka-san. I&#x27;m also at my strongest when my body gets all heated up!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Whoa-, Kanami-chan! She isn&#x27;t backing down one step! Watching toji go at it makes me fall in love with fighter girls all over again-.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> --HAA!!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Whoa, that was close-...!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Think you&#x27;re safe now...? YAA!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I&#x27;m pulling back for a minute!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I&#x27;m somewhat baffled by her dodge then... I was sure I was in her blind spot.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Maybe we should have expected it... Or we should come up with some counter strategy, shouldn&#x27;t we.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> This is fun, but we can&#x27;t keep it going forever-- Time to decide this!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> (Now!)<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> YAA!<br>
<strong>Kinuka:</strong> ...Hyaa-!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Yuii...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> That&#x27;s right, because I&#x27;m Kinuka-san&#x27;s knight in shining armor right now-. I&#x27;ll punish any ruffian who comes near-!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Sorry, Mai. I couldn&#x27;t finish it quick.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> We still have time, so don&#x27;t panic yet, Mihono-chan.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Kinuka, can I borrow your ear for a sec? ...whisper whisper whisper...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Like that!<br>
<strong>Kinuka:</strong> ! ...I get it.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="4-even-a-baby-tiger-can-still-bite-you-know"></a>4: Even a Baby Tiger Can Still Bite, You Know?<a class="hash-link" href="#4-even-a-baby-tiger-can-still-bite-you-know" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Kanami:</strong> There!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Ah-, she got me.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I landed a hit on Tsugumi-san! Only four left!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Maybe it&#x27;s because we aren&#x27;t using okatana, but I can&#x27;t get a handle on this... Though, it&#x27;s no use saying that.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Iwakura-san, we&#x27;ll attack her at the same time. If it goes wrong, I&#x27;m counting on you.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Good idea. I&#x27;ll count on you too, Juujou-san.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> --Let&#x27;s go then!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> You two are getting serious, huh!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> YAA!<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Sorry about this, Etou-san-- HAA!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> ...! I&#x27;m not about to lose, though!<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> You won&#x27;t get me so easy either... See!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Kh, I&#x27;m getting completely... blocked out here.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> (They&#x27;re not giving me... Much room to work with. But--!)<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> ...Ah.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Now it&#x27;s just a fight between me and Hiyori-chan--<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> ...!<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> (Juujou-san... It&#x27;s all on you!)<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> I know-- And it&#x27;s over, Kanami.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> !?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah-, she got me-. I got too focused on Iwakura-san that I couldn&#x27;t react elsewhere.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> I&#x27;m going to go back up Mai and Mihono.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Mm, take care of the rest.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Hey, Iwakura-san. Would you mind... sparring with me with okatana some other time?<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Sure, if you&#x27;ll have me. I heard about it from Juujou-san, but you really do love swordfighting, don&#x27;t you.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Thanks; I just like to see how all kinds of different people sword fight.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Iwakura-san and Tsugumi-san got taken out...<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> We&#x27;re still okay, Mihono-chan! They managed to bring down Kanami-chan, so we still have a chance.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> (But, as for time... there might not be much left.)<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I won&#x27;t let you come any further.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> (Right now, I&#x27;m the only one who has a chance to go after Mizushina-san--!)<br>
<strong>Kinuka:</strong> ...!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Okaay-, there&#x27;s no touching allowed here-.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ahh-, geez~!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Don&#x27;t be afraid, Kinuka-san! Yamashiro Yui is always at your side!<br>
<strong>Kinuka:</strong> That&#x27;s... still a bit scary in its own way.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> You&#x27;ll have to deal with us first, Mihomiho.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Is that so. Then, let me join in, Ellen.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> We haven&#x27;t found each other much before, Hiyoyon, but I&#x27;m not about to lose.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> So long as I&#x27;m standing, I&#x27;ll protect Kinuka, absolutely!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> I don&#x27;t feel like losing either. --HAA!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Oh! I should have expected, Hiyoyon moves so fast I can&#x27;t keep up with her-.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Mirja, Yuiyui, Kinuka. The rest is up to you.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Mihono, if you strike that senpai from Ayanokouji, it&#x27;s our win!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I know that, but... Where&#x27;d Mizushina-san go??<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Mihono-chan... Look out!<br>
<strong>Kinuka:</strong> ...There-!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Huh!?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Ah...! Yamashiro Yui... Guard Mizushina Kinuka right now!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I-I&#x27;m on it... Mirja-san!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> That was way too risky; don&#x27;t scare me like that~. Though, I love an older girl who can be a little daring!<br>
<strong>Kinuka:</strong> Strategizing does need us to be daring at times...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> However, it seems it was unnecessary after all. Having reached the time limit, this is our victory.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> No wayyy~, this is hard to swallow for a bunch of reasons!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I know. I never expected that Mizushina-san might go on the offensive...<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I had no clue about it either-.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I wasn&#x27;t aware of it as well. That may be exactly why she was able to strike where you least expected.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> She lives up to her reputation as a strategic staff officer at STT HQ.<br>
<strong>Kinuka:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> We were doing fairly well for ourselves, but their strategy proved better in the end.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Right, at that moment, I was stuck on the spot.<br>
<strong>Kinuka:</strong> I&#x27;m happy for all the compliments, but the one who came up with the idea itself was Kohagura-san.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> I was sure you&#x27;d come through, Kinuka.<br>
<strong>Kinuka:</strong> She told me that, when the time limit approached and the battle turns into a free for all, they&#x27;d never expect me to attack, so it could work if I came up behind them.<br>
<strong>Kinuka:</strong> When she told me, I was pretty shocked myself, but it sounded good for one last secret tactic, so I stuck with it.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> So Ellen-chan came up with it; that&#x27;s amazing! But, I kinda wish you would have let us in on it...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Sorry, Kanamin. We had to outmaneuver our opponents, see. And that starts by outmaneuvering your allies.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Still, it doesn&#x27;t change the fact that Kinuka did all the work.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I do understand the need to take a risk during battle to accomplish your objective. Though, the possibility that Mizushina Kinuka herself would be taken out was high.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Well also, I thought Kinuka might get bored just being guarded all the time.<br>
<strong>Kinuka:</strong> ...I thought my heart was going to stop, it was pounding so hard. Which was also fun in a way, but it helped me understand what those of you out carrying out our operations go through. You girls in the field sure have it rough...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Now then, let&#x27;s all head back to school, so we can collect our pool tickets!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> There&#x27;s still plenty more fun to be had this summer vacation-!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="5-summertime-with-everyone"></a>5: Summertime With Everyone!<a class="hash-link" href="#5-summertime-with-everyone" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ellen-chan, come see this!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I looked into it a little, and they have different kinds of water slides there! Wow, which should we try first!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Looks like they range from ones for kids, to high thrill slides that advertise the sense of speed. This one&#x27;s the type where you slide down on a rubber boat, isn&#x27;t it?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Ah, Saaya&#x27;s here! Is Kaoru with you?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...She came with me.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Leisure&#x27;s one of my strong suits. There&#x27;s no way I was gonna be late.<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Let&#x27;s do all kinds of fun stuff together today! Mai-chan and Hiyori-chan and them didn&#x27;t manage to win free tickets, but they said they&#x27;ll be coming to the pool anyway, so it&#x27;ll be a ton of fun for sure!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> I&#x27;m looking forward to it a lot.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Did you get everybody together too, Mirja?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Yes. I believe everyone who isn&#x27;t already here should have boarded the bus we arranged on.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Summertime filling your chest with anticipation!! Girls with bright beaming smiles! What is it about swimsuits that makes a girl so irresistible?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Do you think I could turn that in for my summer research project, Mirja-san?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I think it&#x27;s sure to be rejected. Though, if you could somehow gather objective data, it&#x27;s possible.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Don&#x27;t go photographing anyone without their permission, Yamashiro Yui.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Of course I wouldn&#x27;t do that! If I were going to take photos of anybody, I&#x27;d be sure to get their permission first! I&#x27;d want them smiling my way after all!<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Well, if you&#x27;ll be getting their permission, then I suppose it&#x27;s fine...<br>
<strong>Kinuka:</strong> Ah-, since we&#x27;re all going, I should&#x27;ve brought my little sister with me...<br>
<strong>Kinuka:</strong> Though, since Waka-chan&#x27;s so cute, if she came to a place like this, she&#x27;d be hit on for sure... They can&#x27;t lay a finger on my treasure-- No! Come within a 5 meter radius of her...!!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Little sisters are a thing to be treasured! That&#x27;s the truth of the world!<br>
<strong>Kinuka:</strong> Do you... have a little sister too?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I do!<br>
<strong>Kinuka:</strong> Yamashiro-san... Little sisters, they&#x27;re little angels, aren&#x27;t they? I can only thank god for making me an older sister!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I know what you mean! They&#x27;re made of solid cuteness!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Then, you two, shouldn&#x27;t we try all kinds of fun things here now so you know what to do when you come with your sisters?<br>
<strong>Kinuka/Yui:</strong> --That&#x27;s it!!<br>
<strong>Ellen/Yui/Kinuka:</strong> KYAAAAAAA!!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> YAHOOOOOO! The rushing water feels great, doesn&#x27;t it--...!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Ahaha! We came shooting out of there pretty fast-.<br>
<strong>Kinuka:</strong> That was quite the thrill, there...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> That&#x27;s what makes it so exciting!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ahhhh... Sandwiched between two beautiful ladies, I can&#x27;t take ittt..!<br>
<strong>Kinuka:</strong> Yamashiro-san... Are you alright...?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> You don&#x27;t have to worry about Yuiyui. Anway, you two... Want to go for one more?<br>
<strong>Kinuka:</strong> In that case, why don&#x27;t we try another one?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I&#x27;ll follow wherever you ladies lead me-!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> That&#x27;s the spirit! The day&#x27;s only just getting started, so let&#x27;s enjoy it to our heart&#x27;s content!</p></div><footer class="docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="row"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations/edit/docs/Smash_Through_Sports_Chanbara_Joint_Training.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_2_ui" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_13-_"></div></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"></div></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_35-E thin-scrollbar"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#1-joint-training-always-comes-when-you-least-expect" class="table-of-contents__link">1: Joint Training Always Comes When You Least Expect!?</a></li><li><a href="#2-the-feeling-of-a-serious-battle" class="table-of-contents__link">2: The Feeling of a Serious Battle!</a></li><li><a href="#3-a-small-move-done-secretly" class="table-of-contents__link">3: A Small Move Done Secretly</a></li><li><a href="#4-even-a-baby-tiger-can-still-bite-you-know" class="table-of-contents__link">4: Even a Baby Tiger Can Still Bite, You Know?</a></li><li><a href="#5-summertime-with-everyone" class="table-of-contents__link">5: Summertime With Everyone!</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Links</div><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://pastebin.com/LdyviZ8Z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Translator anon&#x27;s pastebin<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Site source code<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Built with Docusaurus.</div></div></div></footer></div>
