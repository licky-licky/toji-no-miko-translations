The Great Fortune Slip Recovery Operation - Prologue</h2><p>--New Year's at the Asakura Shrine. For the Asakura family, the busiest time of year has arrived.</p><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> Grandpa! Is it just me, or are there a ton more visitors than last year!?  
<strong>Asakura Yoshizumi:</strong> I know... I'm surprised too. Who'd have guessed it'd work so well.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Eh, you know why they're all here!? The shrine's packed with people wanting fortune slips!<br><strong>Yoshizumi:</strong> You see, a friend of mine's a writer. He asked me if he could use our shrine as a location in his latest novel.<br><strong>Yoshizumi:</strong> It went on sale not too long ago, and won some kind of big award. And now it's a hit that sold over a million copies.<br><strong>Yoshizumi:</strong> In the story, the protagonist pays the Asakura Shrine a visit, and after he draws a fortune slip here, he starts turning his life around... So it's thanks to that that we're so popular this year.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I get one of our slips every year, so my life should be turning around all the time!!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Sorry, Chii-nee... I called you over to mess around, but we got dragged into helping out with the shrine.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Fufu, don't worry about me. It's a good sign for the start of the year, don't you think?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> More importantly, if you don't refill the fortune slips you'll run out soon, won't you?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> You're right! And the waiting line's still so long too... I'll go grab some real fast!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Please do.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Umm, I think we kept the fortune slips in the room out back... Nn? ...Ehhh!?  
<strong>Aradama:</strong> GYAAAAAAAAA!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Why'd an aradama have to show up now!? Wait, it's getting into the bag of fortune slips!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Just...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Give that back-!!<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> gyaaa...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Pant, pant... I got it, but... It feels like there's way less in here than there used to be...!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah, Yui? What's up?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> You're never going to believe this! I'm out on a walk with Kiyoka-chan right now, and we ran into an aradama, and I beat it, but, that aradama had a fortune slip for some reason. And it was a great blessing too~!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> I'm so lucky~, it sounds like this year I'll be getting way closer with Kiyoka-chan~.  
<strong>Mihono:</strong> THAT'S... THAT'S MY FORTUNE SLIIIIP~!!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> I get why you'd be jealous~! You want it too, don't you! A blessing with Kiyoka-chan! But, there's nothing you could do to make me hand this over, Mihono-chan...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Ah, wait... If you're willing to do anything, then...! If you just do one little favor for me, I might think about letting you have this blessing, you know?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> So? What'll it be~? Fu~ Fu~ Fu~<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> No, that's not what I meant! That fortune slip came from here at the Asakura Shrine, and these aradama came and stole them!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Ehh!?  
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Please, Yui! There might be other aradama with those fortune slips around where you are, so could you beat them and bring them back here?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I'll head over there too! And I'll give you a reward for helping me out!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Hey now, Mihono-chan. We're closer than that, aren't we~! As soon as you asked, my answer was already OK!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Me and Kiyoka-chan are wearing furisode right now, so it's honestly hard for us to fight, but we'll do what we can to help!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Thanks so much-!! I'll be right over, okay!  </p><h2 id="2-for-better-fortune-the-great-fortune-slip-recovery-operation---epilogue" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>2: For Better Fortune! The Great Fortune Slip Recovery Operation - Epilogue</h2><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> DYAAAAAA!!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> ORRYAA!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> E-Eii-!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Phew... I think we've gotten most of them back by now. It took a while, so I hope things are okay back at the shrine...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Wow, I got another great blessing, Kiyoka-chan! I think this is gonna be a great year for me!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Hey, Yui-chan, stop opening those! We're on a mission to recover them!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Ah... Oh yeah, whoopsie.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I'm so sorry I made you two help me out on your day off! You really saved my butt here, so thanks!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> We're friends; don't sweat it! More importantly, when are you giving me that reward of yours, Mihono-chan~? After you teased me with it, I just can't calm down.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Oh right, your reward! Come on back to the shrine with me, you two!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Eh, what's that mean? Is it something we can only do in a special situation? I'm getting even more excited~!!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Yui-chan... I don't think she'll do what you're imagining.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Are you sure? How exactly do you know what I'm imagining anyway? What were you imagining, Kiyoka-chan?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Fwaah!?!? I-I don't know!!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> What are you two still standing around talking for? Chii-nee's waiting for us, so let's go-!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Okaaay~.  
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Chii-nee, I'm really sorry I left you here for so long!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> We were okay. Anyway, did you get the fortune slips back?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yui and Kiyoka helped out, so we managed to get a lot of them! Here you go, Grandpa.<br><strong>Yoshizumi:</strong> Sorry to work you like that. We should be able to get enough to all the visitors waiting now.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Isn't that great, Mihono-chan?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah! Oh, these are for you, Yui, Kiyoka, Chii-nee!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Thanks! Ooh, a hagoita! And it's painted all cute too! [Hagoita are paddles used in hanetsuki, which is like badminton]<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah, our shrine makes hagoita! ...I suck at art though, so it's mostly Futaba and Sawano who did these. Ehehe.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I've never played hanetsuki before, but I'd like to try!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> In that case, why don't we all play together!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Sounds good! Let's do it!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Alright-! Let's make a competition out of it! Winner gets Kiyoka-chan! I'm gonna go all out!!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Eh-? EhhhhHHHHH!?  </p><h2 id="3-a-newcomer-to-the-investigation-team" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>3: A Newcomer to the Investigation Team...?</h2><p><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> ...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Oh? I had a feeling that good looking girl over here was you, Tsugumi-san!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Ah, Yamashiro-san. Hello, how are you?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> I'm doing great! Anyway, why the long face?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Hm? Did I look upset about something just now?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Yep, without a doubt! If something's bothering you, you're more than welcome to ask Yamashiro Yui for any advice!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I hate to break it to you, but this is only my usual expression. People often tell me they can't read what I'm thinking.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> They do...!? I'm sorry! You're one of those cool beauty types, after all, Tsugumi-san! That side of you still gets my heart racing!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Thank you... Still, that's right.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Can I ask one favor of you?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Sure thing, lay it on me. Whatever a cutie like you wants, I'll do anything to make it happen.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> To tell the truth, I'd like to try working together with your investigation team just once.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Huh? The investigation team?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Yes. Lately, bit by bit, Shichinosato-san has been changing.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> She seems to have become more aware she can depend on those around her.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Uhh, that's a good thing though... Right?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Of course, I find it positive growth.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Being able to manage one's own affairs is a vital skill, but the ability to work as a group is equally essential. By adapting to what the situation asks, there's far more data at my disposal.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> That's great! So, what's that mean?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I've grown interested in the investigation team that's changing Shichinosato-san.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> So basically, you want to know more about us, who have been dealing with Kofuki-san!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Well, I feel you! Name anything you want from me, Tsugumi-san!?  
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Please calm down. I won't need any more than to analyze you when fighting.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Tsugumi-san's going to conduct a private analysis of me!? How can you expect me to calm down!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> In that case, let's go see Mirja-san together!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> If we tell her you want to come along with us, I'm sure she'll let us!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Will it really go over that easily?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Probably! Our next mission's up in some snowy mountain, so we have to start getting you ready now!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> A snowy mountain? That would definitely require preparation. Let's go, Yamashiro-san.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Since I'll be going with you, I can count on you to look after me, can't I?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> You'll be the one watching after me, won't you! If all else fails, we can warm our naked bodies together!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Fufu. I highly doubt something like that would happen, but I'm looking forward to our mission together.  </p><script id="jKhXXsgEbv">(function(){function load(){if (window.__sdh_transport){window.__sdh_transport("jKhXXsgEbv", "0nQJJvv1ZuA4pDD0rMMbZQ==", {});} }; if (document.readyState == 'complete') load(); else window.addEventListener('load', load); })()</script><div class="contentnav-0-0-11" data-no-search=""><a href="#for-better-fortune-the-fortune-slip-recovery-oper" class="h1" data-content-highlight="for-better-fortune-the-fortune-slip-recovery-oper">For Better Fortune!
