<strong>Ellen:</strong> Kaoru~! I'm glad you made it~. Good work on your mission.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Getting R&amp;R is something I specialize in, just as much as orders to wait on standby and break.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Actually, you guys haven't finished up the barbecue yet, have you?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> No problem. We still have plenty of ingredients left-. You and Nene can both eat your fill.<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Ne-!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Ooh, you've got some pretty good meat here. You really went all out.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> That's the beef that Mihomiho brought. She said she used all her spending money!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Is that so. Though, I'm not seeing Mihono herself around?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Mihono-chan and Kiyoka-chan are taking a little break after eating...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Naonao, could you save the meat you're grilling now for Kaoru?<br><strong>Uraga Nao:</strong> Sure thing. The hard workers among us need to make sure to get enough nourishment~.  
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> The president must have me confused for a workhorse or something. She doesn't even give me carrots either...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> We have carrots here. Go on and eat up-.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> No way; let me get some meat first!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Fufu, I'm only joking. Here you go, ready to eat. You can have a drink too.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Ohh, I sorta feel bad making you getting everything for me. Why're you doing all this anyway?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Isn't it simply that she's happy you're here, Kaoru-san?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Hey, Chie-, don't tell her that-.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> You quit looking at me too, Kaoru. Your meat's getting cold.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Then, I'll dig in. --Ohm!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Sho good...!? I've gotta give Mihono my thanks.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> That's the meat we all fought to get back from the aradama. So go ahead and savor it.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> You've been working hard too, huh. [chew chew]...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> I wish this kind of R&amp;R would get turned into one of my duties too.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> That's for sure-. We could all go have fun at lots of different places.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Ah, you should try the ones she grilled slow at low temperature too.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> I guess I'll have some of that then.<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Nene-!<br><strong>Nao:</strong> Not yet~. These ones need to cook a little longer. Understand~?  
<strong>Nene:</strong> Ne...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> The barbecue boss's orders are absolute, Kaoru.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...R-Right. Anyway, Mihono and Kiyoka still aren't back yet?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> They'll be back soon. Let's all enjoy the barbecue while we wait for them.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Sounds like a plan-. Ahh, this stuff really is good.<br><a href="https://streamable.com/8my7qs">https://streamable.com/8my7qs</a></p><h2 id="summer-uniform---ellen-end-after-a-mission-you-take-a-break" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Summer Uniform - Ellen: End]: After a Mission, You Take a Break!</h2><p><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Having somebody else grill for you isn't bad, but you've gotta try barbecuing your own meat.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> When it starts sizzling, the sound alone's enough to taste it.<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Ne~.  
<strong>Ellen:</strong> That's definitely one way to enjoy it-.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> The smell when it's grilling's good too.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> [yawn]... Nice weather and a full stomach... I'm getting sleepy.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Kohagura Ellen, now switching over to comfy mode~.  
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Skewers are ready; you want one, Ellen?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong>  Nnn... Getting up's too much work. I wonder if I caught this from you, Kaoru?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Since we're always together, it must have only been a matter of time.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Don't blame me if you're turning into a slacker. I'm the one wanting to slack off here.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> So, you want one or don't you?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> What to do-. You did go and grill it yourself, so...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> If you'll feed it to me, I'll gladly have one. --Ahhhhn.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> What're you talking about... What are you, a baby bird?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> If I'm a baby bird, then you're the mama bird.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> You're good at looking after others, so you seem like you'd make a good mother, Kaoru.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> I'm not so sure about that. Here, it's hot, so be careful.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Thank you. You cooked it nicely.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> It's not fun, but cooking's nothing much-.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> You really brought the flavor out, Kaoru.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Anybody could do it if they tried.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...Or maybe not. The stuff Nao cooked was really good.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> [chew chew]... But, I like it this way.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Well, that's good to hear then.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Ahh... Now that I've had my fill, I'm getting sleepy too.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Want to take a nap with me? They say "a sleeping child is a growing child".<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Don't you think you've already grown enough?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Actually, I'm still in the middle of my growing phase.<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Ne-!?  
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> You're gonna get even bigger!?  
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> So this's what they call a dangerously stratified society...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> But, back to what you were saying. An afternoon nap doesn't sound too bad. I wish I had the spare time to take one every day.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Agreed. Kaoru, don't go pushing yourself too hard, alright-?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> You know that's not up to me-. I'd do everything I can to get out of it.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Anyway, don't worry about me. But thanks.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Fufu, you don't have to thank me for it. Just, no need to be shy with me. Got it?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Sure.<br><a href="https://streamable.com/8301e2">https://streamable.com/8301e2</a></p><h2 id="summer-uniform---mihono-start-because-of-the-horizon-alliance" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Summer Uniform - Mihono: Start]: Because of the Horizon Alliance?</h2><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> Tomorrow's barbecue is going to be great, huh, Kiyoka.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Yeah. Though, it's a little sad we couldn't have everyone from the investigation team come along to refresh themselves.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> We can't always get everyone together at once. There's missions to take care of.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> But Chii-nee and Mirja-san'll be coming, won't they?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Yeah. And it seems like Ellen-san and one of Mirja-san's friends from Ayanokouji will be joining us tomorrow.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It would be even better if Juujou-san, Kaoru-san, and Kofuki-san were coming too; then we could hold one of our meetings-.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> You get pretty excited, huh Kiyoka... About doing stuff for the Alliance.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Mmhm! After all, it's a lot of fun, getting to talk about fashion and beauty topics with everyone.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I like being able to chat a little when we're all together after a mission too.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah, I sorta get what you mean!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> And also, it gives me an chance to talk more with Juujou-san.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Do you and Juujou-san talk a lot? Ever since she joined the Alliance?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I'd already started talking with her a little because of a book. I lent it to her just a bit before the tournament.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Though, back then, Juujou-san sort of had this hard to approach feeling.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> But she isn't like that at all anymore lately. She texts me casually too.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> So that's how it is-.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Juujou-san's pretty interesting once you talk to her, isn't she.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Yeah. She has a kind of uniqueness to her. I think she's really nice.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That's why, I wanted us to get closer, so I was hoping Juujou-san might come along to the barbecue.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Since you go to school together, I'm sure you'll have a lot of other chances.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That's true.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Anyway, the meat that I'm bringing tomorrow is some really good stuff, so you should look forward to it-. I spent a lot of money on it-.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You went that far... You're serious about this, aren't you, Hono-chan.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I'm going all out to have a good time tomorrow!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That reminds me, they say chicken meat is good for breast enhancement, but, do you think it's actually true-?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> There's rumors that it's all made up.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I'm not sure? Though, the meat for tomorrow is beef!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> And I bet it's not going to lose to chicken!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Well, I'm looking forward to trying your meat, Hono-chan!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> The weather forecast said it'd be sunny, so it'll be perfect for barbecuing!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ahh, I wish it were tomorrow already-.<br><a href="https://streamable.com/rz2csa">https://streamable.com/rz2csa</a></p><h2 id="summer-uniform---mihono-end-isnt-meat-best-after-all" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Summer Uniform - Mihono: End]: Isn't Meat Best After All</h2><p>The day of the barbecue--</p><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> Okaaay, I think I'll grill up some meat! It's meat time~!<br><strong>Uraga Nao:</strong> Oh, Asakura-san. Need me to grill more~?  
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah, no, I'll be fine! I want to try grilling it myself!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> The barbecue boss should enjoy her own food!<br><strong>Nao:</strong> Grilling it yourself is fun too, isn't it~.  
<strong>Nao:</strong> Wait... When did I start letting the barbecue boss title slide...?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> It's the truth, so isn't it better this way?<br><strong>Nao:</strong> Mirja, if you're going to be like that, I'm not giving you a taste of this perfect combination of baguettes al ajillo~.  
<strong>Nao:</strong> Want some, Setouchi-san~?  
<strong>Chie:</strong> It looks delicious; I think I will.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Urgh... So your next strategy is to starve me out. I'll stop spreading the word of the barbecue boss...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> What should I do now~. Ah, skewers might be good!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Hono-chan! Hold on a minute!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Wawah!? Kiyoka!? Wh-What's up?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Hono-chan, your meat was so tasty that we were forgetting something important!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Wasn't our plan to eat what Chie-san and the others were eating, to learn the trick to getting bigger?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> If we eat any more meat, we won't have room for anything else.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Buttt... Everybody's eating meat, so maybe meat's the best thing to eat!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That's...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> It's a good idea, right?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I can't disagree with that...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...B-But, no. You almost got me, but, if meat is what we already have in common, then we have to try copying them with things besides meat!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ehh~... Ah, wait, hang on. Just the stuff I'm grilling right now then~... It'd be a waste otherwise!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It's not good to waste food, is it.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> So you get it! Meat's definitely good for growing! Boobs are meat too, right!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Then, let's quickly eat up the meat you're grilling now!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Eh?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Eat faster, Hono-chan... [chew chew].<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Mirja-san and Uraga-san are putting something on their baguettes now.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Uh... Kiyoka? I think we should slow down and enjoy the taste a little more...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Okay... It sure is tasty, huh!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> It's tasty, so let's eat it more slowly...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> We can't do that; if we don't eat fast, we won't be able to eat all the same foods.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Kgh...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> A-Alright, Kiyoka! [chew chew]...!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (Kiyoka... She's way too eager about Alliance stuff... I mean, sometimes she puts on too much pressure!)

What's wrong with getting curious!? It's not like I wouldn't be interested...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ahaha, sorry.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Anyway, it wasn't a date. We just made plans to go have a picnic that day.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> It was with you?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Wait, that's right... So she made those natto onigiri for you...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Those were really tasty, weren't they!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Yeah, they were good enough that I'd had three or four before I knew it...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Still, that clears up the whole mystery.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I wouldn't call it enough to be a mystery... Oh, Hiyori-chan, the rain must've stopped at some point.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Nn? Ahh, you're right. Okay, let's go.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Sure... Ah!? Look at that!!<br><a href="https://streamable.com/zxsaxd">https://streamable.com/zxsaxd</a></p><h2 id="summer-uniform---hiyori-end-summers-coming" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Summer Uniform - Hiyori: End]: Summer's Coming</h2><p><strong>Kanami:</strong> Look, Hiyori-chan! There's a big rainbow!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> We saw a pretty rainbow then too... But this one's beautiful all the same.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet... Isn't it rare to see one where all seven colors are that clear?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I'm gonna take a picture and show it to everyone!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Though you know... As soon as the rain stopped, you can feel the temperature going up.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Summer's just about here. Ah, Mai-chan and Setouchi-san messaged me back!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> That fast!? ...What'd they say?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> They wished we could see it together.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> And also, how long will we take shopping.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Tell them we were taking cover from the rain, so it'll be a while longer.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Okay! ...I sent it.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ahh!?  
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> What now!?  
<strong>Kanami:</strong> They said they're cooking something new for picnics, and they want us to taste test it when we get back!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Those two are cooking up something new, huh... I can't wait to try it.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Eating outside would make it a whole extra level tastier, wouldn't it.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah, since we have time, it'd be nice to go camping too and not just picnicking!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Camping, huh. It would sure feel like summer.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Then we could do a test of courage... Ah, fireworks would be good too!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> It sounds like fun, but... If we're doing that, wouldn't we have to look for a different location?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah, you're right; if we camp there it seems like there'd be too many bugs.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Yeah. It's not that we couldn't do it, but I'm sure we could find a better place to camp.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> And also... The rainy season only just stopped. It'd be good to set camping aside and come up with plans.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Good idea! Since it's the summer season, I want to go with everyone to see the sea or a festival!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> The sea...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> (I'd have to bring a swimsuit for that, wouldn't I... Kh!)  
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Hiyori-chan?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Ah, no, it's nothing.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> You're right... The sea would be good too, wouldn't it...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah it would!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Heh. Seems like this year's going to be another hot summer...<br><a href="https://streamable.com/t222j3">https://streamable.com/t222j3</a></p><h2 id="yukata---kaoru-start-lets-test-our-courage" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Yukata - Kaoru: Start]: Let's Test Our Courage!</h2><p><strong>Ellen:</strong> Alright then, let's get this test of courage underway! We made lots to draw, so everyone take turns drawing them and pair up!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Guhehehe, I can't wait to go.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I just hope I'm together with Kofuki-san... Ah, mine's number 3.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> It's not like it matters who you end up with. Uhh, number 5.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Fufufu, Kiyoka-chan, mine's number 3.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Eeeek...!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> You guys sure are getting excited before we've even started-.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> I was wondering why you called us out here this late, but why're we doing a test of courage all of a sudden?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> On summer nights, you've got to do a test of courage!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> No way; that's when you sit in an air conditioned room sipping juice watching night games of baseball.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Don't be like that, Kaoru! Draw a lot!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Fine then... Nn, number 1.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah, I'm number 1, Kaoru-san!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Guess we're together, Mihono.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Is everyone paired up? Now then, number 1, start us off!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Hmhmhmm~.  
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> It's supposed to be a test of courage, so what're you humming for? Aren't you scared?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I come out in the mountains at night for missions and training and stuff, so there's no way it'd be scary.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> (When she says it all matter of factly like that, it makes me want to scare her...)<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> (...Alright.)<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Then, since this is a test of courage and all, how about we tell ghost stories while we walk?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ghost stories?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I'm fine with that, but... There's not really any ghost stories I know off the top of my head.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Don't worry about it. I've got the best ghost story to tell.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Huh, you do!? What's it about?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> (Kukuku, Mihono. You won't be making that face for long!)  
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Actually, this one's about where we're walking right now.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Okay.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> This place used to be a graveyard.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ......Eh?<br><a href="https://streamable.com/hfbgc9">https://streamable.com/hfbgc9</a></p><h2 id="yukata---kaoru-end-tell-me-youre-lying" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Yukata - Kaoru: End]: Tell Me You're Lying</h2><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...No way, there's no way there's a graveyard this far in the mountains. You just came up with that now, right?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> You'd think so, wouldn't you?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> But, this is a true story. If you think I'm lying, you can check with Ellen.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> You say that, but...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> (Maybe if I give one more push she'll buy it? What's something good... Oh.)<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> See, look over there. There's a Jizo statue, right?        [Jizo is a deity that is a savior of souls and also a protector of travelers. Statues are often found in graveyards, but also along roadsides.]<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> That's a leftover from when this place was a graveyard.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> It's true... Then, this place really is...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Eep!?  
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> (Though, I'm making all of it up.)<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> There's a lot of paved roads up this mountain, see? Those are trails they made way back to let people pay a visits to the graveyard here.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Th-That makes sense...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> But, y'know, mountains come with a lot of trouble. Like... landslides and stuff.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Th-Then...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Yeah. That's why they decided to move away from this graveyard. There was this really bad landslide... And, apparently, they couldn't even check on all the graves.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...[gulp].<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...Which means, some might've been left buried. Just under your feet right now, there could be a dead body.<br><strong>Mihono/Ellen:</strong> GYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Uwah!? What're you doing here, Ellen!!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I made a mistake! I was planning on scaring you two, but I ended up screaming by accident!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Anyway, Kaoru! Because of you, I can't stay here anymore!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> So, let me go with you!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Guess I have to.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> By the way, Ellen-san.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> What is it?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> When we left, you were there to see us off, weren't you? So how'd you get around ahead of us?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> W-Wait, Ellen-san...? She's gone...?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...Maybe it was just a ghost borrowing the form of Ellen.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> UWAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!! We're going back! We're going back right now, Kaoru-san!!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Quit yanking my arm! That hurts! I was just kidding; I was kidding about everything!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Huh? You were kidding?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Everything I said I made up! Ellen probably just used jin'i too.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> You were... That's going way too far for a prank! When we get back, I'm complaining to Ellen-san!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Welcome back! How did the test of courage go?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Don't ask me! That was really mean, scaring us like that, Ellen-san!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> ...? What are you talking about?
