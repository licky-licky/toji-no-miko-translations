Prologue</h2><p>--On the night of Christmas Eve, the streets, which every year were covered in twinkling lights, were looking strangely empty this year.</p><p><strong>Yui:</strong> Whyyy!? Why are all the lights off this year!?  
<strong>Old Salesman:</strong> W-Well, you see, we tried turning them on, okay?<br><strong>Old Salesman:</strong> But you know, as soon as we did, it started attracting aradama.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> B-But in that case, we can get rid of them! So please, if you have a heart, turn the lights back onnn!<br><strong>Old Salesman:</strong> I wish I could help you out here, but... Look, when we put the ornaments up, the aradama got tangled up in them and dragged them away.<br><strong>Old Salesman:</strong> So we're out of ornaments, and I don't want any more aradama coming round. Maybe it's better just to give up on it this year?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> ...I'll get... Them back...<br><strong>Old Salesman:</strong> Eh?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> I'll get back every last one of the ornaments! And I'll get rid of all the aradama myself-!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Then you'll turn the lights back on for me, right!?  
<strong>Old Salesman:</strong> L-Look, I'm not the only one responsible here... Anyway, were you really looking forward to the lights that much?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Take a look at that!<br><strong>High School Girl Returning from Cram School:</strong> Aww, there's no lights up this year. This is the worst.<br><strong>High School Boy Returning from Cram School:</strong> I remember you loved seeing them last year.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> And look over there!<br><strong>OL Returning from Work 1:</strong> Last year's lights were the prettiest thing to a lonely girl on Christmas, but it's even sadder if they're not doing them...<br><strong>OL Returning from Work 2:</strong> Come on now, let's go to the bar together~ Hey mister, pour two for us!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Do you see!?  
<strong>Old Salesman:</strong> ...Uh... See what??<br><strong>Yui:</strong> This part of town is loaded with girls coming round to see the decorations!!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> And they need to see those shining lights!! So I'm going to save Christmas!!!!<br><strong>Old Salesman:</strong> O-Ohh, I guess you're right...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Then I'll be right back after I hunt down those aradama! I'm counting on you to turn those lights back on!<br><strong>Old Salesman:</strong> Ah, hey! ...She's gone already. I don't have the authority for something like that though...<br><strong>Old Salesman:</strong> I guess I can try calling up the local officials and commerce association at least...<br>--At the same time, a few streets away...</p><p><strong>Mirja:</strong> Sigh... No sign of the Akabane sword here either, it seems.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I suppose it won't be that easy after all.<br>--Earlier on the same day, shortly after noon at Aoto-kan.</p><p><strong>Aoto Youji:</strong> Yo, missy. I'm glad as can be you decided to pay me a visit today, but...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> What is it, Aoto Youji-san.<br><strong>Youji:</strong> Well, I mean, it's a bit sad seeing a pretty young lady like yourself hiding away looking at swords on Christmas Eve.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I don't find it sad in the slightest. I'm off duty today, so I thought appreciating swords and their mountings would be a perfect use of my time.<br><strong>Youji:</strong> Haha, there's no stopping you, is there, missy.<br><strong>Youji:</strong> Oh right, speaking of Christmas and winter days, I wonder if you've heard this one before?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Heard what?<br><strong>Youji:</strong> There's an okatana said to be as fleeting as the snow itself. Name's "Sekka".<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> This is the first I've heard of it... Is there anything more you can tell me?<br><strong>Youji:</strong> Course. The blade itself is a pure blueish white, like snow crystals, and there's a rumor that, during the winter season, this okatana'll show a divine power one time if its owner asks.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I see, that's an interesting story. If there is an okatana like that out there, I'd like to be able to see it for myself once.<br><strong>Youji:</strong> You know, it's part of the rumor that, this time of year, Sekka's one of those Akabane swords they find out of aradama.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> FWHA-!?  
<strong>Mirja:</strong> ...Excuse me, is that true? Does it have to be any specific aradama, in any specific place, or will any do?<br><strong>Youji:</strong> Y-Yeah, I think anywhere'll do. Every couple of years you hear about someone coming across Sekka.<br><strong>Youji:</strong> I've never been able to witness it myself, but... Well, even if someone does find it, it doesn't seem to stick around for them to use it very long.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I can't afford to waste any more time. I'll begin suppressing aradama right away.<br><strong>Youji:</strong> Sekka's nice and all, but don't you want to take a look at this? It's these special "Holy Night" mountings we've got just for the Christmas season, and...<br><strong>Youji:</strong> ......<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> There's no use complaining about it. So long as I continue defeating aradama...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Oh, more have appeared.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Yamashiro Yui! What are you...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Ah, it's Mirja-san! Nnnn~, I'd love to stay and share my love with you, but I'm busy right now, so it'll have to wait till next time, sorry-!!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Yamashiro Yui should have had today off as well... Could she be after Sekka too?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Heh, then I have no intention of losing here. I'll be the first to find Sekka!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Pant, pant... There's still a ton of aradama left. I've gotta get those lights turned on soon!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Haah-!  </p><h2 id="2-take-back-a-twinkling-christmas-eve-epilogue" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>2: Take Back a Twinkling Christmas Eve! Epilogue</h2><p><strong>Yui:</strong> Pant... Wheeze... Not yet... Aradama... Gotta get rid of... All of them...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Ughh...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Guess that's it for me.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> I'm falling apart. I can't get back up.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> The lights still aren't on though... I can't let today end without finishing this.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> There's no time for me to rest here.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> So get up already!<br><strong>Someone's Voice:</strong> ...shi...i!<br><strong>Someone's Voice:</strong> ...mashiro...i!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Yamashiro Yui! Can you hear me!?  
<strong>Yui:</strong> Mirja... San...?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> You've regained consciousness. That's good.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Just as I was impressed with how aggressively you dealt with those aradama, you suddenly collapsed in the street. I was worried, so...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Mirja-san was worried about me... I might faint!!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Though it seems my concerns were unnecessary.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Ahem... Anyway, have you found what you were after?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Huh? What I'm after...? Ah, the lights still aren't on, are they?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Huh? Lights?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Right, once I remove all the aradama around here and get back the Christmas ornaments, they'll turn the Christmas lights back on!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> O-Ohhh...?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> (Does this mean I jumped to conclusions and unnecessarily made Yamashiro Yui my rival...?)<br><strong>Yui:</strong> What's wrong, Mirja-san? You're blushing?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I-It's nothing. More importantly, what about the lights? The aradama in the area have been largely cleared out...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> I got a lot of the ornaments back too, so I was thinking it can't take much more...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Hm... To tell the truth, I was here suppressing aradama for another reason... Why don't we combine forces to finish the job?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Ehhh-!? Just you and me in a tag team, Mirja-san!?  
<strong>Yui:</strong> Hnng~! If only I knew there was a reward like that waiting for me! Hard work gets repaid after all!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ...I feel like I'm losing more than I offered, but I'll let it slide. Let's move out.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Sure thing!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Mirja-san! Don't you feel like we're totally in sync today?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> It's true that our coordination is smoother than usual today. But I'm more surprised by that perseverance of yours, Yamashiro Yui.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> I know, right! I thought I was at my limit back there, but now I feel like I can just keep on going!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> It must be the power of our love that let us bust through those barriers!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I'm certain that isn't the case, but let's keep up this momentum and continue the attack!<br><strong>Yui &amp; Mirja:</strong> WOAAAAH!!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Pant... Pant... Was that... All of them...?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Pant... Yamashiro... Yui... Take a look... Around us...<br><strong>Female Student:</strong> Ooohh. For real, they turned the lights on? That's perfect!<br><strong>Drunken OL:</strong> Wh-What, what!? They're doing the lights again? Ahhahaha! This's the best! Being single's the best!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Mmmm~, this is it! This energy! This is the real Christmas spirit! We did it, Mirja-san!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Yes, seeing everyone pleased makes it all worth it.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Now that's what I call mission complete!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Oh, my phone. Sorry, I have to take this...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Mm, it's Onee-chan. Are you okay being up this late?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> ...Oh, so you can see the lights from the hospital?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> That's great. I know you were looking forward to it. Yeah, I can see them too.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> They sure are pretty~... I hope we can see them together next year.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Mm... Okay... Oh yeah, for your present, you still want the same thing, right?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Yep, I already told Santa about it.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I see... The power of love, wasn't it?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Ah, sorry that took a while. So what do we do now?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Hm. More aradama could appear, so perhaps we should walk around and patrol the area, so they don't turn the lights off again.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Wait, that sounds like... Are you asking me out on a Christmas date!?  
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I am not. Maybe we should patrol separately just to be sure.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I want to be with you, Mirja-san! Let's go!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Hang on, who said you could wrap your arm around mine?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Just let this be my reward for saving everyone's Christmas! Just for a little bit!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Honestly... Fine, for a little bit.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> And that's what happened... What's wrong, Aoto Youji-san? Are you crying?<br><strong>Youji:</strong> Yamashiro-chan, what a good girl, thinking of her sister.<br><strong>Youji:</strong> Oh right, what happened on your end, missy?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> With Sekka? I found it, and had it restored and polished. Like you said, it's an okatana with a dreamlike beauty...<br><strong>Youji:</strong> Ohh! Well I'm glad to hear it.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Unfortunately, I wasn't chosen by Sekka, but other members of [your unit name here] are able to make use of it.<br><strong>Youji:</strong> At least that worked out. Ah, right, bring it by here sometime and I'll make some special mountings for it.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I'd appreciate that.<br><strong>Youji:</strong> You might only have it for a short while, but you'll want to use Sekka the best you can!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Right.  </p><h2 id="3-how-those-two-spent-christmas" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>3: How Those Two Spent Christmas</h2><p><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Damnit... I've been looking all over, but she's not even at the Christmas party, is she.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Oh? Shichinosato-san?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Hey, it's Sayaka and her keeper. You two done with the party already?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Sayaka-chan's keeper...<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> We were going back to the party. ...Kofuki, what are you doing?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Ahh, just looking for someone.

The research lab is that way.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> That should be it for the database of aradama that appeared during the Christmas Unified Mock Battle.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> With Shichinosato-san's help, collecting this information became much easier. I'll have to maintain that relationship.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> She must be enjoying herself at the party right about now.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Fufu... There's aradama nearby?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I had heard that, while the party is ongoing, the elite guard would be responsible for aradama countermeasures, so everyone's busy at the moment.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> In which case, I suppose I get to handle data collection here myself. Let's see, where's my okatana... Ah.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Oi, you planning on keeping all the aradama-chan to yourself?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Oh, did the party finish already?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...Of course not! Besides, you're the one who invited me, so why aren't you there!?  
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> ...?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> What're you looking all confused for! If someone invites you somewhere, you'd expect them to go too!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> By any chance, were you looking forward to going to the party with me?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> That's not... Whatever, I give up. Anyway, you're going to play with some aradama-chan, right?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Then I'm going with. It'll sure beat some lame party!<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> You've changed, you know, Shichinosato-san.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> I don't want to hear it from you of all people. You were bouncing up and down when you got that new sample before.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Fufu, how perceptive of you.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> I can figure out that much.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> You can? That's a little surprising.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> So, where's the aradama-chan at? Let's go already.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Don't be in such a rush. There should be enough aradama for the two of us tonight, probably.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> The elite guard have been hogging them all day, so I wanna fight some as fast as possible. Got it?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> That's more typical behavior for you. Why don't we get to it then?  </p><script id="aBHxmoJSiD">(function(){function load(){if (window.__sdh_transport){window.__sdh_transport("aBHxmoJSiD", "0nQJJvv1ZuA4pDD0rMMbZQ==", {});} }; if (document.readyState == 'complete') load(); else window.addEventListener('load', load); })()</script><div class="contentnav-0-0-11" data-no-search=""><a href="#take-back-a-twinkling-christmas-eve" class="h1" data-content-highlight="take-back-a-twinkling-christmas-eve">Take Back a Twinkling Christmas Eve!</a><a href="#1-take-back-a-twinkling-christmas-eve-prologue" class="h2" data-content-highlight="1-take-back-a-twinkling-christmas-eve-prologue">1: Take Back a Twinkling Christmas Eve!
