We successfully cleared out the aradama without incident.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> They went and dragged us into a mission on New Year&#x27;s morning. Couldn&#x27;t they give us a special bonus and call it our New Year&#x27;s money?<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> ...Having seven people is inefficient. Couldn&#x27;t some of us have been absent or on standby?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> You tell &#x27;em-.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Hm? This is...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> What is it? Did you get some urgent assignment?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> No, you don&#x27;t need to worry about that. I only received a strange message.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> It caught my attention because the subject is: &quot;Focusing on aradama will help you.&quot;<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> What does it say?<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> It sounds like spam... Maybe you should just delete it without checking. Ah, I mean... Not that I&#x27;m trying to argue with you or anything, Itomi-sama?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> It has no images or URL; only text.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> &quot;If you&#x27;d like to know more, first head to &#x27;1-middle, 1-down, 4-down, 2-middle, 0-up&#x27;. Then, take a picture of the location. Attach it in a response to this message.&quot;<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> --That&#x27;s all it says.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> That&#x27;s it? It sounded like some kind of code.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...There used to be a lot of ghost stories that started with texts like this, weren&#x27;t there? You think it doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with you, but then... It goes like that.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> ...I think it&#x27;s only a prank, but, with the reference to aradama, I can&#x27;t overlook it.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Well I&#x27;m not interested in any aradama, so I just want to go straight home-!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Same. I don&#x27;t want stick my neck into trouble right after getting out of a mission. I can already tell this won&#x27;t be worth it.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> See, exactly! Let&#x27;s go back home!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> I just got a message on my phone... Is this a hint?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> &quot;It&#x27;s a store very popular among certain young girls (they say) What you hold in your hand now is the &#x27;key&#x27;.&quot; --That&#x27;s what it says.<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> They&#x27;re specifically sending messages to us thenn...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> It&#x27;s suspicious...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> We can&#x27;t disregard whoever&#x27;s sending these at this point. Itomi Sayaka, could you show me that hint once more?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Here.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Thank you.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> ...A store very popular among certain young girls. I don&#x27;t know what the &quot;they say&quot; part refers to, but is &quot;1-middle, 1-down, 2-middle, 0-down&quot; the name of the store?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> The other hint: &quot;What you hold in your hand now is the &#x27;key&#x27;&quot;, does it mean phones?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> You guys... Aren&#x27;t you a little too fast in switching gears to whatever weird stuff comes up?<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> ......Let&#x27;s just give in and solve this riddle. I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;ll be the most efficient outcome.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> ...But, I wanted to go home-!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> We can go home after we find who sent these messages, so you try your best too, Suu.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="2-the-hint-is-always-right-beside-you"></a>2: The Hint is Always Right Beside You<a class="hash-link" href="#2-the-hint-is-always-right-beside-you" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> &quot;1-middle, 1-down, 4-down, 2-middle, 0-up&quot;... So, it&#x27;s numbers, and... What&#x27;s the up, down, and middle part about? Some kind of location, or direction?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I wonder what rules it&#x27;s following. They gave a hint that it has to do with our phones, but... Hmm.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Aghh, I keep sending Hokuto-san Happy New Year&#x27;s texts, but she isn&#x27;t responding to any-!<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> ...That&#x27;s amazing, Inami-san.<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> You&#x27;re writing those texts unbelievably fast.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Eh, am I really that fast?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...How are you going that fast pressing the screen so few times?<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> ......She&#x27;s using flick inputs. Inami-san, please demonstrate.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Just watch me!<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> With flick inputs, if you want &quot;A&quot;, tap A. If you want &quot;Ke&quot;, tap Ka and flick it to the right, see? For &quot;O&quot;, go down... like that!<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> [clap clap clap]~...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> So, if you tap and keep it right in the middle, you get A sounds. Left gets you I sounds. Up gets U sounds... Right gets E sounds. Down gets O sounds... And you can write like that...?<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> You&#x27;ll mess up at first, but once you get used to it, it&#x27;s a lot faster.<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> Excuuse... me. I figured out that code... I think.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Did you, Nitta Hirona? Please explain.<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> Okaay.<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> The numbers in here apply to each line of the Japanese alphabet. 1 is the A column, 2 is the Ka column, 3 is the Sa column, 5 is the Ta column... and so on.<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> &quot;1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0.&quot; &quot;A, Ka, Sa, Ta, Na, Ha, Ma, Ya, Ra, Wa.&quot; --If you write it out easier to understand, it&#x27;s like this.<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> And, the middle and down part is, when you use flick input, the direction you flick it.<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> So the directions point to each column of the Japanese alphabet, or which vowel to use in each line...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Oh! You change the input, but you tap the A column and number at the same place!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> When you put it like that, it makes sense.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> So... 1-middle is &quot;A&quot;. 1-down is &quot;O&quot;. 4-down is &quot;To&quot;. 2-middle is &quot;Ka&quot;. And last is 0-up, &quot;N&quot;. Is that it?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Aoto... kan.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> It&#x27;s Aoto-kan? It&#x27;s true that it&#x27;s popular among certain young girls... Toji like ourselves. And, if the input method on our phones is the key they mentioned, there&#x27;s no questioning it.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> That place isn&#x27;t far from here. Guess we should run over there.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Hiyori... I&#x27;m surprised to see her getting so into this. Does she actually like this kinda thing?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> If you invite Juujou-san along, she&#x27;ll come up with some reason to join in.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Well, as long as she&#x27;s having fun.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> It&#x27;s closed. Probably should have expected that, since it&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Day.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> For now, let&#x27;s send a photo of Aoto-kan&#x27;s exterior as we were instructed.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> ...I&#x27;m surprised to get a response almost immediately after sending it, but, is this another code?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> --&quot;Head to 111121145&#x27;s former research facility.&quot;<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...The place where the research facility is became numbers?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> They&#x27;re not making it easy on us, but it sounds like it from how they wrote it. Did you get another hint, Sayaka?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> I didn&#x27;t get one.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Making us do this without a hint is a huge difficulty spike out of nowhere, isn&#x27;t it-?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah, take a look at this. The paper on the door to Aoto-kan...!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> &quot;Greetings, Happy New Year&quot; ...and afterwards is...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> &quot;1, 15, 20, 15, 11, 1, 14. owner, Aoto Youji.&quot;<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> This is likely the same as the previous code.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Do you think this is a hint, maybe? Like... these numbers represent Aoto-kan, or something.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> But, isn&#x27;t the amount of numbers different...?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> The first question was in hiragana, but this one might be in some other alphabet.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Then, if these numbers do represent Aoto-kan as Musumi Kiyoka suggests, the &quot;1&quot; at the start is very likely &quot;A&quot;.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...This is hard.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> You&#x27;re supposed to spend New Year&#x27;s under a kotatsu with mikan. It&#x27;s basically the law... But this is probably gonna keep us stuck here for a while.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Nn... Wait, it&#x27;s my phone this time. What now... &quot;The place of origin of certain okatana.&quot; What&#x27;s that about?  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="3-is-cracking-codes-business-as-usual-for-toji"></a>3: Is Cracking Codes Business as Usual for Toji?<a class="hash-link" href="#3-is-cracking-codes-business-as-usual-for-toji" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Suu:</strong> &quot;Head to 111121145&#x27;s former research facility&quot;...<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> It says that, but, this code... Does it make any sense at all? I&#x27;m hitting max hopelessness here; I can&#x27;t think of anything anymoreee.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Don&#x27;t force it, just take it easy-. I feel like passing on this one too.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah--! The amount of numbers here, this has to be it when you write it with the English alphabet...!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> A, O, T, O, K, A, N. With seven of them, you get Aoto-kan.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> So A is 1, then O is 15, T is 20, K is 11, and N is 14?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Exactly. I think these numbers probably apply to the English alphabet starting from 1 in ABC order.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Wow... Kiyoka-san! I think you&#x27;re right.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> In that case, let&#x27;s examine the string of numbers &quot;111121145&quot; piece by piece.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> The first sequence of 1s could be 1 or 11. And, as there are 26 characters in the English alphabet, it&#x27;s reasonable to assume the end is 5 and not 45.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> E is the fifth letter, so the end is &quot;E&quot;. Or, a syllable that ends with &quot;e&quot;.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> The next question is whether the number in front of the 5 is a 4 or a 14.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> If it&#x27;s a 4, that would make it D, so the end is &quot;De&quot;. If it&#x27;s a 14, it would be N, so it reads as &quot;Ne&quot;.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> This one&#x27;s definitely gonna take a lot longer than the hint, since they broke Aoto-kan up by letters.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> That&#x27;s true. Then, let&#x27;s move to the first number, 1, or &quot;A&quot;.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> There is a chance it could be 11, or K, but if it were 11 and 11 then it would be read as Kk, which wouldn&#x27;t make sense, so we can exclude it.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Which means, the name of the next place we go either starts with &quot;Kaa&quot; or &quot;Aka&quot;, but I think &quot;Aka&quot; sounds right. Right, Mirja-san?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Yes, I reached the same conclusion. After all, our next destination is a former research facility, and the hint Mashiko Kaoru received was that it&#x27;s &quot;the place of origin of certain okatana.&quot;<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I realized it&#x27;s a place that we, the investigation team, were very familiar with.<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> Ahh... Since you&#x27;re... the Akabane sword investigation team?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Yeah. If you split up the numbers like this, you get &quot;1, 11, 1, 2, 1, 14, 5.&quot;<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> If you match it up with the English alphabet, then it&#x27;s &quot;A, K, A, B, A, N, E&quot;. Akabane.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> We did previously investigate the 5th Physiological Research Institute in Akabane, and it does match the description of a former research facility. If that&#x27;s our destination, I can guide us there.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> With how closely it matches, it doesn&#x27;t seem likely it&#x27;d be anything else.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> The 5th Physiological Research Institute in Akabane... Let&#x27;s go. I think Mirja and Kiyoka got it right.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> &#x27;kay, let&#x27;s get going-. You know, I feel like I had to solve a riddle like this before.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> It&#x27;s kind of dark and creepy here...!<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> ...It looks as abandoned as you&#x27;d expect for an unused building. Did you get any additional instructions?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It doesn&#x27;t seem like it yet.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Come over here. There&#x27;s something written on the floor in chalk.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> The chalk is hardly eroded, so I suppose that means this is our next code.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> --&quot;Head to where the 6023NJ141 is performed&quot; ...is what it says.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> There&#x27;s numbers and letters this time. Even if we tried the same rules as last time... it wouldn&#x27;t work because there&#x27;s a 0, would it? Though, maybe it&#x27;s not a 0, but a capital O...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Hmm, I wonder what they mean by a place where something&#x27;s performed...?<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> I&#x27;m at a loss... completely.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Kaoru... Did you figure out anything?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> What&#x27;re you asking me for? It&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m all that great with this stuff...<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> But, when I don&#x27;t know what to do, you and Ellen always help.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Well... I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the right move here, but just plain solving the riddle isn&#x27;t the only approach.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> When we started out, they said &quot;Focusing on aradama will help you.&quot;<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> First was Aoto-kan. Then the abandoned building that had to do with the Akabane swords. So, wouldn&#x27;t the next place also have to do with toji and aradama?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That makes sense. Ah... They messaged me this time! I&#x27;ll read it out.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> --&quot;It&#x27;s just as important to focus on appearances. Pay attention to the shapes.&quot; --&quot;It&#x27;s a place where those who fight with okatana in hand gather.&quot;<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Half of it was just like Kaoru said.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Come on, if you&#x27;re gonna give us a hint, do it sooner...<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> ...It&#x27;s kind of mean of them, isn&#x27;t it.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> --6023NJ141.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Why don&#x27;t we focus on the shapes of these letters and numbers for the time being.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="4-the-place-where-the-codes-connect"></a>4: The Place Where the Codes Connect<a class="hash-link" href="#4-the-place-where-the-codes-connect" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...6.0.2.3.N.J.1.4.1. They told us to look at the shapes, but I don&#x27;t even know where to begin.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Maybe the shapes are similar to something...<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> What&#x27;s 6 similar to... If you look at it upside down, I guess it&#x27;s a 9?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> It could be a good way of looking at it. However, thinking of 6 as 9 doesn&#x27;t seem like it will help make any significant progress.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...Kaoru, what were you looking on your phone for?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Just reading back through the messages Ellen sent me over winter break. Ahh, there it is. Right here. Look at this.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> &quot;H3110 KAORU! How are you spending your winter break?&quot; See how it says that?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> The part at the start; doesn&#x27;t that kinda look like this code? With the numbers and the letters.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Ah! That &quot;H3110&quot; is &quot;Hello&quot;, isn&#x27;t it. I used to play around writing like that with my friends.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> That&#x27;s how it works.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> It&#x27;s true that it&#x27;s similar in some places. Like how 3 is substituted for E, though the orientation is inverted.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> So they&#x27;re replacing letters with numbers? That sounds like a good clue.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Don&#x27;t worry about it. I already found a chart for swapping these. You can find a lot of this stuff on the internet.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> I&#x27;ll say what 6023NJ141 swaps into, so somebody write it down. 6 is &quot;G&quot;, 0 is &quot;O&quot;, 2 is... &quot;Z&quot;, probably. 3 is &quot;E&quot;.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> And then, we should be able to leave &quot;N&quot; and &quot;J&quot; as is. 1 is either &quot;I&quot; or &quot;L&quot;. 4 should be &quot;A&quot;. Cause it looks like a lowercase &quot;a&quot;.<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> Then that means 6023NJ141 is... &quot;GOZENJIAI&quot;?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> The place we have to go to next is where they hold the tournament (gozenjiai)?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> There&#x27;s the martial arts hall where they hold preliminaries with representatives from each school. But, they probably mean... the place where they hold the finals, don&#x27;t you think?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> That place did leave a pretty crazy impression. All thanks to a couple people I know.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...Hmph. Either way, are we going to be able to get in there on New Year&#x27;s morning?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Let&#x27;s go and check for now. It won&#x27;t do us any good staying here.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Yeah. I don&#x27;t want to be here too long, and I&#x27;m a little bit curious to see what&#x27;s next on this riddle solving tour!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> It doesn&#x27;t sound that &quot;little bit&quot; curious anymore. Though, since we came this far, we might as well go along too.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> They let us in...<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> We can interpret that as us being correct to come here... No wait, I just got a message. That settles it.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> The subject is: &quot;This is the final riddle. After that your reward is waiting.&quot;<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> There&#x27;s got to be a reward for solving riddles, after all. If they don&#x27;t have one, that&#x27;s a scam! A scam!<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> Inami-san... you sure got excited about this. You switch on and off, I get iit.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> After coming this far, you have to get excited for it! Otherwise it&#x27;d be like going to a joint live and leaving just before your idol comes out!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> I&#x27;m glad you want to do it, Suu. Mirja, what&#x27;s the riddle?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> I&#x27;ll read it out loud.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> --&quot;Think back over today, and visit the shrine dedicated to the god linked to the following 3.&quot;<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> &quot;2-middle, 7-left, 9-left&quot;. &quot;201921182179&quot;. &quot;N4M42U&quot;.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> They specifically advise us to think back over today, so I suppose that means to solve the codes using the previous solutions and guess a specific shrine from these keywords.<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> We know how to solve them, so this should go quick... ...That&#x27;s helpfull.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...I got a message too? &quot;The hint this time is you yourself.&quot; ...What does that mean?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Hmm, so then it has some connection to Juujou-san?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> The shrine&#x27;s on the Yamato Plain... That&#x27;s gotta be it.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> That&#x27;s it. I&#x27;m going to kill you.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="5-the-future-the-present-reaches"></a>5: The Future the Present Reaches<a class="hash-link" href="#5-the-future-the-present-reaches" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Okay, let&#x27;s start by cracking the codes. The first is &quot;2-middle, 7-left, 9-left&quot;. If you put that into a phone, it&#x27;s... &quot;Ka&quot; &quot;Mi&quot; &quot;Na&quot; Ri&quot; (thunder).<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> Thunder... A natural phenomenonn. I&#x27;ll write it down.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Next is &quot;201921182179&quot;. These numbers are the alphabet. You replace them counting from 1, 2, 3 starting from A.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> So Z becomes 26. There&#x27;s no 0, so the first one has to be the 20th letter of the alphabet.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> T!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> There wouldn&#x27;t be 79 either, so the last one has to be 9. And, the 9th letter is I.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> These 12 numbers separate into 20, 19, 21, 18, 21, 7, 9 which equals in that order: T, S, U, R, U, G, I.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Reading it out... you get tsurugi (sword). It has to be swords.<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> I did the last one, &quot;N4M42U&quot;... Comparing it to what Mashiko-san found online, it&#x27;s &quot;NAMAZU&quot;u.<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> Namazu... It&#x27;s a fish. Ahh... By the way, did you know, replacing letters with characters that look vaguely similar is called &quot;leetspeak&quot;?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Thunder, swords, namazu. Does anyone know what shrine has a god that&#x27;s related to these?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Oi, Sayaka. You&#x27;re forgetting the most important one. Thunder, swords, namazu, and, horizon chest.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Try putting your hand on that chest of yours. Anything come to mind?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...It does. But, let me say one thing. I&#x27;ve been thinking this for a while, but you really don&#x27;t have the right to talk down to me here, do you?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Maybe I don&#x27;t. But I&#x27;ll do it anyway.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> You&#x27;re...... Whatever. Let&#x27;s get back to the question. When you think of thunder, swords, and namazu, the Japanese god connected to them is Takemikazuchi. He&#x27;s the god of both thunder and swords.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> There was also a widely believed anecdote about him sealing a namazu that was thought to be causing earthquakes.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Do you have any idea which shrine is dedicated to Takemikazuchi?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> At Kashima Shrine. Since I was the hint. It&#x27;s where the style of swordfighting I use, Kashima Shinto-ryu, is supposed to have originated.<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> Then, that settles it-.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> If it is Kashima Shrine... you realize that&#x27;s in Kashima City in Ibaraki. Are we going to catch trains all the way there?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> A helicopter showing up now? I suppose that means we should get on board. There&#x27;s no other choice if we&#x27;re going.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> EHH-----!?<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> WE&#x27;RE GETTING ON THAT!?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> This is where the mystery person sending us messages should be.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> They&#x27;ll probably be coming around any second now.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Kaoru-! Happy New Year! You all did really well-!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> What&#x27;d you send us on this whole goose chase for right on New Year&#x27;s... I&#x27;m supposed to be sitting under a kotatsu eating mikan right about now.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Sorry, but I was only here to help out. The evil mastermind is-- Grandpa!<br>
<strong>Friedman:</strong> Hahaha, you could put it nicer than that, Ellen.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> ...Dr. Richard Friedman!?<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> There&#x27;s a celebrity!?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Why are you here?<br>
<strong>Friedman:</strong> I wanted to give you a little surprise as a New Year&#x27;s greeting.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> It didn&#x27;t seem that little... You went all out. What was the point of all this?<br>
<strong>Friedman:</strong> It might be a bit late to say it, and I know it&#x27;s preaching to the choir, but I wanted to give you another chance to think about toji and aradama while having some fun.<br>
<strong>Friedman:</strong> All the places you visited today were related to the two of them, weren&#x27;t they?<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> Yes, and they were places we had a personal connection to as well.<br>
<strong>Friedman:</strong> This nation has spent a long time with aradama. Even if that relationship and the state of things shift, that connection is likely going to remain.<br>
<strong>Friedman:</strong> And, as toji in service, you all have the ability to shape the state of things in the future. Though, practically speaking, you&#x27;ll need the support of a great deal of people to make that happen.<br>
<strong>Friedman:</strong> But, I won&#x27;t bore you with any more of this. For doing so well on making it here to Kashima Shrine, I&#x27;m inviting all of you on a hot springs trip. Think of it as your New Year&#x27;s gift.<br>
<strong>Kaoru/Suu:</strong> Hot...<br>
<strong>Hiyori/Kiyoka:</strong> ...Springs!?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Ahh... but, this is one of those things, right? I&#x27;m about to get called back on an urgent mission.<br>
<strong>Friedman:</strong> No need to worry, during this trip, you&#x27;ll be completely off the clock. I&#x27;ve already talked it over with the presidents of each school.<br>
<strong>Mirja:</strong> If you&#x27;ve gone to that extent, then we&#x27;ll enjoy this vacation to the fullest.<br>
<strong>Hirona:</strong> It&#x27;s important to take breaks... I appreciate the hot springs too. It&#x27;s what&#x27;s most important.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Oohhhhh! You planned this all out perfect, grandpa! It&#x27;s so perfect I didn&#x27;t know what to say for a second. Ellen, your grandpa&#x27;s the best!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> I&#x27;m really happy you can tell how great Grandpa is, Kaoru.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> And then, tomorrow, we can all go again and do our first shrine visit together! I hope we&#x27;ll all get along this year~!</p></div><footer class="docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="row"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations/edit/docs/Happy_New_Year_The_Tojis&#x27;_New_Year&#x27;s_and_Prayers_[mystery].md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_2_ui" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_13-_"></div></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"></div></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_35-E thin-scrollbar"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#1-riddles-in-place-of-osechi" class="table-of-contents__link">1: Riddles in Place of Osechi</a></li><li><a href="#2-the-hint-is-always-right-beside-you" class="table-of-contents__link">2: The Hint is Always Right Beside You</a></li><li><a href="#3-is-cracking-codes-business-as-usual-for-toji" class="table-of-contents__link">3: Is Cracking Codes Business as Usual for Toji?</a></li><li><a href="#4-the-place-where-the-codes-connect" class="table-of-contents__link">4: The Place Where the Codes Connect</a></li><li><a href="#5-the-future-the-present-reaches" class="table-of-contents__link">5: The Future the Present Reaches</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Links</div><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://pastebin.com/LdyviZ8Z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Translator anon&#x27;s pastebin<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Site source code<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Built with Docusaurus.</div></div></div></footer></div>
