She&#x27;s gotten better at MCing since last time, and when I went to shake her hand, she even remembered me!<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> And Sonomiya Eden-san winked at me too; this seriously made all the painful missions I&#x27;ve had to go through up till now worth it-! 	[The kanji in their names are puns on Noah&#x27;s Ark and the Garden of Eden]<br>
<strong>Asahina Hokuto:</strong> ......Right.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> They&#x27;re trying so hard...<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> You don&#x27;t know how lucky we are we got tickets for such good seats. That&#x27;s all thanks to you applying for the lottery for us, Hokuto-san!<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Ah, what did you think, anyway? About Garden&#x27;s mini-live concert!<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> This was my first time seeing an idol concert, so it felt very fresh...<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> I&#x27;m glad you liked it then~. I&#x27;ll give you the CD and scarf towel I bought in case I could turn someone into a future fan!<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> Ah... Thank you. You really like those girls, don&#x27;t you. I hadn&#x27;t heard of these idols at all before though.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Garden still has that feeling like, only those in the know know how good they are, so I&#x27;m not surprised-.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Early on, the two of them both wanted to go solo, so they couldn&#x27;t get along. Garden back then... You could say it was more of a wasteland.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> But, after all the times they fought, you can see now just how well they get together.<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> Even though they fought, they turned out alright?<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> They did! At first, Noa-chan and Eden-san used to be so serious about their idol activities, and apparently they got in lots of arguments over where to take their careers.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> They said that, in order to decide who&#x27;d lead them, they had a bunch of battles, like, who could get the highest score in karaoke, or who could hold a smile the longest.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> But, as they did that, it made them start understanding each other better! Isn&#x27;t that so idol-like!<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> I don&#x27;t exactly know... what is and isn&#x27;t idol-like. But it&#x27;s true that battling can be a way to bring people together.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> That whole story was another reason why I became a fan of theirs.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> I want to watch over them until the day they spread their wings and make it out into the big open sky of showbiz!<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Doesn&#x27;t seeing cute girls sing and dance just fill you with energy!<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> ...I think I understand you somewhat. It&#x27;s the fruit of their efforts.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> After that... With the Renpu and Heijou joint-practice starting in three days...<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> I think I might be able to make it... maybe... somehow.<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> Be more assertive. Where did the energy you got from those girls go?<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> I already used it all up. Ever since I got assigned to be a member of this, I&#x27;ve been depressed... So depressed.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> If you weren&#x27;t going to be there, I would&#x27;ve faked being sick to get out of it!<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> Don&#x27;t say that so shamelessly.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> ...The joint-practice this time, if only it were like the Five Traditions sponsored idol event they did before, then I could&#x27;ve just watched all the toji who became idols...<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> Toji who... became idols?<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> It&#x27;s real; I&#x27;m not making it up! They all... wore costumes, and sung and danced, and they were all sparkling.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> And I even thought that, maybe... I might find someone new to be a fan of there.<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> ...I see.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> I&#x27;ve got it! Why don&#x27;t we go have fun somewhere tomorrow, so I can make it through the tough practice?<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> What are you saying? Tomorrow we&#x27;re going to be training for the practice.<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> I came up with the perfect training regimen for you, Suu.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Ehhhhh!<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Why do I have to do training before the practice though... You&#x27;ll make me die from exhaustion.<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> You won&#x27;t have to worry. I took into account your stamina and muscle mass while making this regimen.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Hokuto-san, you&#x27;d go that far... for me.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> But that doesn&#x27;t mean I have to do it... Right!?<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> ...I went along with you to your event, so join me in training for a while. Just a little while is fine.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Ahh-... I don&#x27;t want to go to training or to practice.<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> An aradama signal...?<br>
<strong>People on the Streets:</strong> A-ARADAMAAAA!?<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> ...!<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> ...GRRUUU!<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> We&#x27;re going... Suu.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> C-Can&#x27;t we at least wait for the toji in charge of the area to show up? Let&#x27;s do that!<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> We can&#x27;t. We mustn&#x27;t turn a blind eye to aradama. Even if I have to go alone... I&#x27;m going.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Ahh-, fine~~... I-I got it. I got it, okay, so please, don&#x27;t go off on your ownnn...!<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> Thank you. Let&#x27;s hurry.<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> HAA!<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> Kh... There are too many people... This could be bad.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Hokutoo-saaaan... I can&#x27;t go on any more-.<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> Once backup arrives, this will be easier... Just hold out a little longer. You can still use utsushi, can&#x27;t you?<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> You said that a while ago~~...<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> ...GUGGGGI!<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Awawawa... There&#x27;s a really big one coming our way-!?<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> We&#x27;re here to support you!<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> !!<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Th-Thank you so much, thank you so much...!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Iwakura-san, let&#x27;s stop that aradama from moving first.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> That would reduce the damage the most, wouldn&#x27;t it.<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> ...GUOOOOOOO!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="2-this-was-supposed-to-be-my-day-off-to-recharge"></a>2: This Was Supposed to Be My Day off to Recharge...<a class="hash-link" href="#2-this-was-supposed-to-be-my-day-off-to-recharge" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Sanae:</strong> --There!<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> ooo...!!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> --HAAAAAH!<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> Those two, we fought in the tournament qualifiers...<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> If some strong girls are here, then we should leave it to them and evacuate!<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s going to happen. Don&#x27;t lose heart now.<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> GRRRUUU...!<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Why do they just keep coming one after the other...!?<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> We can&#x27;t afford to leave everything to just those two.<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> YAAAAA-!<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> ...uuuu!!<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Great job.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Um, would you mind making a makeshift team with the four of us, to stop the aradama together? If we cooperate, I&#x27;m sure things will go more safely.<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> I&#x27;d be glad to.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> I&#x27;d appreciate it if you wouldn&#x27;t count me as part of that-!<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Err, but that&#x27;s...<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> The four of us will fight.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Hey!?<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Then, Asahina-san and Juujou-san will respond to aradama as they appear.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> And, I&#x27;ll go with the girl from Renpu, um...<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> It&#x27;s... Inami. But, just to be clear, I&#x27;m not any good at fighting!<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Mm, that&#x27;s fine. Inami-san and I will watch for any coming from the rear or your blind spots, and support the two in the vanguard.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Also, we need to help with evacuations. There should be people who couldn&#x27;t get away in time.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> That&#x27;s the basic plan of action, but what do you think?<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> I feel like I should be the one evacuating right about now, but... I think I can do that...<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> I don&#x27;t see an issue with that either.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Then, I&#x27;ll be in your care.<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> Of course, likewise.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ! ...Looks like a new one showed up.<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> ...GGGIII!<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Inami-san. Let&#x27;s leave that aradama to them for now and watch the perimeter!<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> I want to run I want to run I want to run I want to run... Uuuu...!<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> ...Maybe another toji will happen to be passing by and swap with me!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="3-before-i-knew-it-i-was-with-three-heijou-institute-girls"></a>3: Before I Knew it, I was With Three Heijou Institute Girls!<a class="hash-link" href="#3-before-i-knew-it-i-was-with-three-heijou-institute-girls" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> There were quite a lot of aradama, weren&#x27;t there.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> S... So tireddd... I was looking forward to this day off too...<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> You did well. The toji in charge of the area are here, and the noro is being collected, so everything will be fine now.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Thankfully, almost none of the people who came to enjoy Harajuku were hurt either.<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> Having your support made a huge difference, Juujou-san, Iwakura-san.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> I think it&#x27;s more because of how quickly you two engaged the aradama, Asahina-san.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Umm-, do you three all know each other?<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> I know these two. Though...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> I remember you too. We faced each other in the tournament qualifiers, after all.<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> ...You remember that?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Sure I do. You left an impression on me.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> And, I knew you long before we competed in the qualifiers.<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> You too, Iwakura-san...? I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ve ever spoken though. We haven&#x27;t ever been on a mission together either.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> You&#x27;re pretty famous around Heijou, Asahina-san.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> I hear a lot about the hard working senpai one year above us who spends an incredible amount of time training.<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> Ahh, that&#x27;s why. I don&#x27;t push myself as hard as I used to though.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> No no no, you still train more than enough, Hokuto-san! I feel like, if I didn&#x27;t ask you to come out with me, you&#x27;d be stuck training again.<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> What makes you think that...<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Cause, every time we get together, you&#x27;re always trying to get me to practice with you, aren&#x27;t you!?<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> That&#x27;s because you show a lot of promise, Suu. If you train properly, I know you&#x27;ll become much stronger.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> ...But, it&#x27;s not like I want to be stronger.<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> Wouldn&#x27;t that be a waste of your talents? You were chosen to be a part of this joint-practice as well, weren&#x27;t you?<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> That must&#x27;ve been a mistake... It has to be.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> You got selected too, Inami? Then that means all four of us will be at the practice.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> That&#x27;s right. Since we&#x27;ll all be together, why don&#x27;t we go get some ice cream for now?<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> There&#x27;s a shop I was thinking of visiting before we ran into the aradama.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Ah, I&#x27;d love to go! This is how a day off should be!<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> With this many flavors... It&#x27;s hard coming to a decision.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> I recommend the chocolate mint then.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Ah, I mean, only if you&#x27;re not sure. It&#x27;s just my suggestion...<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> Thank you. I&#x27;ll give it a try.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> This mixed berry is so good~~!<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> We were saying, next time we have a chance to come to Tokyo together, we had to come here.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> I&#x27;m glad we came.<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> I&#x27;ve never really had chocolate mint before, but I think I might like this quite a bit.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> They&#x27;ve been having chocolate mint flavored sweets in convenience stores and places a lot lately, haven&#x27;t they?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ! Yeah, that&#x27;s for sure.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> There really are some people who get it out there.<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> By the way, have you two heard what exactly we&#x27;ll be doing in this joint-practice?<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Ah! Why didn&#x27;t you ask me about that-?<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> Well, you... You wouldn&#x27;t have closely read over the notice and paperwork, would you?<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> I did read them though...! I wanted to see if there was anything scary sounding, or dangerous!<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> There wasn&#x27;t a lot explained in them though...<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> I read through the paperwork after I was selected too, but it didn&#x27;t say much, other than that its purpose was to strengthen our coordination.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> By the way, I couldn&#x27;t help but notice, but, even though you come from different schools, you two are awfully close, aren&#x27;t you.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> We are! Every time Hokuto-san is in town, we go out to have a good time, like we were doing today!<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> ...Though I just keep Suu company.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Well... That kind of thing happens, even between girls from different schools...<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Fufu, I think it&#x27;s really nice to be like that.<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> I do too.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Ahh... Anyway, about the practice... I wonder what we&#x27;ll be doing...<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Even if I know what we&#x27;re doing, if I don&#x27;t like it, I won&#x27;t like it. But, not knowing what we&#x27;ll be doing is scary... It&#x27;s way too scary!<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> I think I understand a little how you&#x27;re feeling. But, if we just keep focused and work at it, it shouldn&#x27;t be anything that&#x27;ll hurt us.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> It&#x27;s hard enough just trying not to get hurt...<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> Suu. After coming this far, resolve yourself to see it through.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> If, in three days, either of you get paired with Suu at the joint-practice, please look after her.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Sure, if we&#x27;re together.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Of course, now that we&#x27;ve gotten to know each other here. Let&#x27;s look after each other, Inami-san.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> ............Okay.  </p><div class="videoWrapper"><iframe width="640" height="480" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B5DZsaFp9t0"></iframe></div><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="4-joint-training-it-started"></a>4: Joint Training... It Started...<a class="hash-link" href="#4-joint-training-it-started" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Before the start of the Renpu Heijou Joint-Training.</p><p><strong>Suu:</strong> ...I&#x27;m overwhelmingly out of place here!<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> Could you not start shouting out of nowhere.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> But, will you... just look around!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> .....<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Not only is there Juujou-san and Iwakura-san we met in Harajuku the other day...<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> There&#x27;s girls like Itomi-san, who makes sure to finish any mission you give her, and that girl who loves fighting aradama way too much... Aradama-Must-Die-Man Shichinosato-san too!<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> I told you not to be so loud... They&#x27;ll think it&#x27;s rude if they hear you. And what&#x27;s Aradama-Must-Die-Man anyway?<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> ...That&#x27;s slang for her.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> She loves fighting aradama and stuff. To where it&#x27;s impossible to wrap your head around... Isn&#x27;t she sort of scary...?<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Please God, I&#x27;m begging you... Don&#x27;t put me in the same group as her...<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> You&#x27;re right that there are strong fighters here from both schools, but we&#x27;re only here to train together. You&#x27;re worrying too much.<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> And besides, she&#x27;s another student from Renpu, the same as you.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> That doesn&#x27;t reassure me at a--<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> ...What is it now? Why are you hiding behind me?<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> There, over there... It&#x27;s Tsubakuro-san... and Satsuki-san, from the elite guard.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Yomi-onee-san, do I really have to be here for this too-?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> You do. This is a part of our duties as the elite guard.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> What do we have to do?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> We need to instruct everyone gathered here on the details of their training. Though, I believe Shidou-san and Konohana-san will handle most of that...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Then, you don&#x27;t need me, do you? If I don&#x27;t get to fight all the strong people I want, then I want to go home-!<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> (I don&#x27;t want to get involved with Tsubakuro-san... No, I don&#x27;t want anything to do with anyone from the elite guard!)<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> (Back then... When we met in Okinawa, they were way too scary...!)<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Well if it isn&#x27;t Asahina Hokuto and Inami Suu.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> HYAAU!?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ? What&#x27;s wrong with her?<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> Don&#x27;t worry about her, Shidou-san. Anyway, what did you need?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Nothing, just thought I&#x27;d say hi to you two. I&#x27;m sure this training will be helpful for you. I hope you&#x27;ll make good use of it.<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> Of course; we plan on it.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> It&#x27;s about time for us to get started. Good luck out there.<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> She was only saying hello. You&#x27;re too jumpy.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> That was just, an irresistible force, or more like, a synergistic effect; a lot happened...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> This training is organized to drill you on small-scale group battles, but it has one other objective. That is--<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> For you to be able to clearly convey your actions and intent to your allies in a short time, so that, even if you are partnered with someone new, you can work together to dispose of aradama.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> If there&#x27;s an increase in aradama appearances, the amount of missions will go up too. In which case, you won&#x27;t only be fighting with the companions you&#x27;re used to.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> With that situation in mind, you&#x27;ll be divided into groups by lottery. Don&#x27;t go swapping your results after you draw them.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Twenty minutes after the groups are assembled, we&#x27;ll carry out group battles!<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> (Hokuto-san, Hokuto-san! Please let me be with Hokuto-san!)<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> (Also, please don&#x27;t let me be with anyone scary...!!)<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> This is how it goes sometimes.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Right, I&#x27;m so glad... God granted my prayers!<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Or at least, half of them...<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> What, there&#x27;s no aradama-chan here? ...This sucks.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You shouldn&#x27;t say things like that...<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> I&#x27;m Asahina Hokuto, first year in the Heijou Institute&#x27;s high school division. Nice to meet you.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> Come on, you say yours, Suu.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> I-I&#x27;m Inami Suu... second year in Renpu Girls&#x27; School&#x27;s middle school division. Please go easy on me...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah, you&#x27;re in the same year as me, Inami-san. I&#x27;m Musumi Kiyoka. It&#x27;s nice to meet you.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...Do mine for me-.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...Honestly, Kofuki-san.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> This is Shichinosato Kofuki-san. She&#x27;s a third year in middle school. We both work together in the Akabane swords investigation team.<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> So you two already know each other as well. That&#x27;s good then; it should be easy for us to coordinate.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Right. In this situation, what do you think we should go over first?<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> It seems, right after this, we&#x27;ll be having group mock battles. So why don&#x27;t we decide on our roles in battle? We&#x27;ll start with choosing an attacker.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> I&#x27;m not being the attacker. There&#x27;s nothing fun about going up against other people.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...Y-You can&#x27;t be like that right from the get go.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> But there&#x27;s no point in teams of toji fighting each other, is there? A toji&#x27;s job is fighting aradama.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> ...I-Isn&#x27;t that right?<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> That&#x27;s true. There might be some logic to what you&#x27;re saying.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Oh, nice to see you two get it.<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> However, being able to coordinate with one another is more important than anything. That&#x27;s why I won&#x27;t consider this training a waste of our time.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> If that&#x27;s how you feel, then you guys can do something about this yourselves.<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> That won&#x27;t do. If you won&#x27;t participate seriously, this training will lose its meaning.<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> And on top of that... If we aren&#x27;t able to coordinate during our missions, you might be injured beyond recovery.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...Like I&#x27;m supposed to care.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Uhh, umm... Why don&#x27;t we all take some deep breaths and calm down first!?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...Asahina-san is right, Kofuki-san. If you ended up getting hurt, I&#x27;d be upset.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...Tch.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Fine, I get it. Let&#x27;s just figure this out already.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="5-coordinating-all-of-a-sudden-is-hard-to-do"></a>5: Coordinating All of a Sudden Is...

It&#x27;s scary.)<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> (...I hope this ends soon. But, getting cut hurts, so I don&#x27;t want that to happen...)<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> (So, right now, this is all I can do...)<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> --You can do it, Hokuto-san!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> HAA!<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> Kh... She&#x27;s quick!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I&#x27;ll be right--<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> I&#x27;m not letting you go, Musumi-san!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Eh, when did you...!?<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Now&#x27;s our chance!<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Understood.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> You&#x27;re actually taking this seriously... Really?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> That&#x27;s rude. I&#x27;m fundamentally a serious person, aren&#x27;t I?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> It would be a problem if they didn&#x27;t think I was serious and our research funding was reduced-.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Though, you&#x27;re not my opponent now anyway, Shichinosato-san.<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> ...Suu, stand firm!<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Thinking about it, they have to be coming after me, right--!?<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Sorry about this. Anyway.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> NOOOOOO!?<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Even with utsushi, it still hurts... Uuu...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I know what you mean... It sure hurts, doesn&#x27;t it. When you&#x27;re being slashed, you can&#x27;t help but flinch against it.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Ahh, I&#x27;m so glad someone here understands! Thank you, Musumi-san!<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> I can&#x27;t be useful at all, so I... I&#x27;m thinking of withdrawing from this. I feel like that&#x27;s the best way for me to contribute!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Eh... P-Please, hold on a minute!? We&#x27;ll be in trouble without you, Inami-san!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> And also, this is just a maybe, but... If Kofuki-san and Asahina-san can&#x27;t coordinate, then this group won&#x27;t...<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> ...Right.<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> If you won&#x27;t cooperate some more, we won&#x27;t be able to practice anything...<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> There&#x27;s no aradama-chan here, so no thanks-.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...But, didn&#x27;t you say you understood that before?<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> (Ah-... I think Hokuto-san&#x27;s mad... I&#x27;m not even the one who made her mad, but I&#x27;m feeling sort of uneasy.)<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> (I wish that someone would step in and reconcile this... Even someone from the elite guard would be fine, just, won&#x27;t someone stop them?)<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Nn-? Huh, Onee-san?<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Ah, I didn&#x27;t mean it after all!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Didn&#x27;t mean what?<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> ...It&#x27;s nothing.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I think I might&#x27;ve seen you before. Did we meet somewhere, Onee-san?<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Ehh-... Ahh-... Umm-... Uhh-...<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> (What should I do, what should I do... Maybe it&#x27;d be fine if I said honestly, we met last year in Okinawa? But, but, if I pretend like she&#x27;s got the wrong person, maybe she&#x27;ll lose interest and go away!?)<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I can&#x27;t tell what you mean when you just say &quot;Uhh-...&quot;, Onee-san.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Th-There&#x27;s no way we could have met anywhere before, Tsubakuro-sama...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Why&#x27;re you calling me Tsubakuro-sama even though I&#x27;m younger? Wait, this feels familiar for some reason...<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> AWAWA...! Umm, umm... It looks like you elite guard are having another tough day of work, huh!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Not really-... There&#x27;s nothing to do, so I&#x27;m just bored. It&#x27;s not like I get to fight anybody strong either-.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> I&#x27;m tired of this, so I&#x27;m going to go play with Yukari-sama! Bye bye~.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Tsubakuro-san... You&#x27;re as free spirited as ever... I&#x27;m jealous...<br>
<strong>Announcer:</strong> We are beginning the next match, so will the following groups please prepare straight away.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="6-how-did-it-come-to-this"></a>6: How Did it Come to This...?<a class="hash-link" href="#6-how-did-it-come-to-this" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Maki:</strong> So each group has gone through a number of battle exercises at this point. Hm...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> (Though, there&#x27;s groups that are coordinating well, and those that aren&#x27;t. The difference is greater than I was expecting.)<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> (Even when you gather nothing but people greatly skilled at fighting, they might not function properly as a team in some cases.)<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> (Asahina and Shichinosato&#x27;s coordination is going to take time to improve, won&#x27;t it...)<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> (Getting rid of ignorance within a unit is another part of this training&#x27;s goals. I&#x27;ll watch them carefully for now.)<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> We lost again, didn&#x27;t we...<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> The hell, I fought like you told me to, didn&#x27;t I? And anyway, she&#x27;s barely fighting worth anything either.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Ah, that&#x27;s true...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Hey... Kofuki-san!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> U-Um... Try not to let it get you down, Inami-san.<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> It&#x27;s true that, with how fearful Suu is acting, I can&#x27;t call her an asset to the team.<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> Even when I put her through training whenever we meet, I wouldn&#x27;t say she&#x27;s very enthusiastic.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Hokuto-san, even if it&#x27;s true, when you say it out loud... You&#x27;re making me depressed.<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> But, you should be capable of fighting harder than that. Shichinosato-san.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Yeah and, what about it?<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> I understand full well that you won&#x27;t get serious unless you&#x27;re fighting against aradama.<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> However, I&#x27;d hate it if this training went on like this. We were given the chance to participate, so I don&#x27;t want it to go to waste.<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> Which is why...<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> They did! At first, Noa-chan and Eden-san used to be so serious about their idol activities, and apparently they got in lots of arguments over where to take their careers.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> They said that, in order to decide who&#x27;d lead them, they had a bunch of battles, like, who could get the highest score in karaoke, or who could hold a smile the longest.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> But, as they did that, it made them start understanding each other better! Isn&#x27;t that so idol-like!<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> I don&#x27;t exactly know... what is and isn&#x27;t idol-like. But it&#x27;s true that battling can be a way to bring people together.<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> ...Let&#x27;s settle this with a match. What do you say we agree the loser will obey the winner for the remainder of this training?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...Huh?<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> If you win, I won&#x27;t complain.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Have you got muscles for brains or what...?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> But, fine. If I win, then this lameass argument&#x27;s done with too.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> E-Eh... Is it really okay for you to duel like this?<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> It&#x27;s not a duel. This is simply practice in the form of a standard match. Move away.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> You can&#x27;t go pushing yourself too hard just because your leg injury healed.<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> Thank you. I know.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You could have just done the practice properly.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> It&#x27;s fine.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Let&#x27;s get this started already.<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> I&#x27;m ready anytime.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Then I&#x27;ll get right to it--!<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> You are strong... But!<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> --HAAA!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Tch...<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> What&#x27;s going to happen...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...Mm.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> It seems like some people have started a match on their own...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Wait, just leave them for now. If the situation gets worse, we&#x27;ll step in.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Hopefully this can bring about some kind of change in that group.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Maki-san, it seems a mass outbreak of aradama has occurred in Harajuku just now.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ...!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I only just got the report. This joint-training has been changed to a joint-operation. The elite guard are to direct their suppression.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Got it. Let&#x27;s hurry!<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> It seems like now&#x27;s not the time for our match.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Sounds like a whole load of aradama-chan are out there. Good thing I joined in on this training.<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> We&#x27;ll be up against aradama, so I&#x27;ll be depending on you readily.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Ahhh, why did this have to happen-!?  </p><div class="videoWrapper"><iframe width="640" height="480" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w5SUJ2yqPuo"></iframe></div><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="7-everyones-pretty-motivated-arent-they"></a>7: Everyone&#x27;s...

<strong>Yomi:</strong> These may be hasty arrangements, but... I ask you all for your support.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...The silver lining is this happened while we were here training. With all these people, we can take care of it quick.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm... I want to show what we&#x27;ve learned from training.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Ahhh... Even though the training was hard, I thought we wouldn&#x27;t be in any danger at least...<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Ah--!?<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> With all these amazing people here, do they really need me? They don&#x27;t need me, do they!<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> That won&#x27;t do. This is your mission too, so you need to handle it properly.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> But I think I&#x27;m definitely not needed here... Sigh... It&#x27;s scary; I don&#x27;t want to fight any aradama.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I understand the way you&#x27;re feeling. Me too... I don&#x27;t want to have to fight if I can help it.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> ...Musumi-san!<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> (They give me support and they help me out; maybe I can depend on people from Heijou...?)<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> I&#x27;ll keep being in your care then!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Nn? ...Mmhm, likewise.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Shichinosato-san, I&#x27;m relying on you to get me aradama data.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Yeah, count on it.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> (Ah... Thinking about this the other way around, with all these strong people here, doesn&#x27;t that make this a really safe mission?)<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Shichinosato-san&#x27;s started looking all excited too.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That&#x27;s usually how she is before we go on a mission.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> You better be letting me play with some aradama-chan tough enough to be worth it, okay?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> No need to worry about that. We&#x27;re expecting a lot from the group with you, Itomi, and Juujou.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> The site you&#x27;re going to has a high number of outbreaks.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Understood.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Ahhhhh... Why do you want to go to the most dangerous places?<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> (I just don&#x27;t get it... Are Shichinosato-san and Itomi-san actually space aliens or something...?)<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> Don&#x27;t make that face. If it comes down to it, I&#x27;ll be there to save you.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Hokuto-san... I won&#x27;t leave your side!!<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> Then we wouldn&#x27;t be able to fight, would we...?<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> ...Are you feeling that motivated for this?<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> I am. It&#x27;s rare to join a mission alongside a select group of top fighters. There&#x27;s nothing to dislike about it.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I am feeling a little nervous, but let&#x27;s try our best to keep up, Asahina-san, Inami-san.<br>

<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Just gimme a minute.<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> ...GUGGGI!<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> ...Waaahh!? They came this way!?<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> I feel like I&#x27;m in danger; I&#x27;m running away!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Not you too, Inami-san!? There&#x27;s still aradama that way!<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> This&#x27;s it for you--<br>

<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Huh!? Hey... You&#x27;re getting in the way of the good part!<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Buttt...<br>

<strong>Aradama:</strong> ...GGGII!<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Eeeeeek!?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...Inami-san!? Whatever you do, keep your utsushi up!<br>
Elsewhere, Hokuto and the others were--</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Things are taken care of over here.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> It was a real help having you handle the aradama following the big one around, Asahina-san, Ban-san.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm... We could focus on it thanks to you and Tsugumi.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> No need to thank us. It&#x27;s our mission.<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> I only did what I was capable of.<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> (Itomi Sayaka, Juujou Hiyori... They really are strong.)<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> (It&#x27;s not that I think I&#x27;ll get the chance to become that strong just by completing missions with them, but, a toji&#x27;s strength... There might be no limit to it.)<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> (Though... Why are there this many talented individuals in one group to begin with?)<br>
<strong>Screaming Voice:</strong> EEEEEEKK!?<br>
<strong>Screaming Voice:</strong> SOMEBODY HELP MEEEEEEEEEE...!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Just now; that&#x27;s...!<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> ...It&#x27;s Suu. Let&#x27;s hurry.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Musumi-san... Shichinosato-san! I&#x27;m begging you... I&#x27;m begging you, so... Hurry!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> There&#x27;s still way more aradama-chan to go through, so sit put!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Inami-san, you reapplied utsushi just now, didn&#x27;t you? That makes the third time... There aren&#x27;t a lot of toji who can reuse utsushi that much.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> We came to save you, but, you seem okay...?<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> I&#x27;m not okay at all... At all!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> I saw you reapply utsushi just now. You can still fight.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> I&#x27;ve been in a huge pinch this whole time!<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> She can still fight. Suu can use utsushi even more than this.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Why are you telling them that!?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> That&#x27;s amazing...<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> In that case, you can keep on being aradama bait for me!<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Ehhhhh!?<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Certain data does indicate that aradama also tend to attack weaker seeming targets. Though it&#x27;s still in need of verification.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Don&#x27;t just decide that on your own...!! I&#x27;m not an aradama charmer, okay!?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> You don&#x27;t need to worry. We&#x27;ll protect you, Suu.<br>

<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Are you doing alright-?<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> I just got a little spooked by the sound of okatana hitting an aradama...<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Even though I realize everyone&#x27;s getting rid of the aradama.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I see. Though, Inami-san, it seems like you can use utsushi a great number of times, so if you were able to overcome your fears facing aradama, it would be very unlikely you would get hurt.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Thinking about it is one thing, but actually doing it is a whole different story.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I understand. Raw data gathered from aradama will be biased, so it&#x27;s vital to see the aradama moving about up close like this as well.<br>
<strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Today is looking to be an auspicious day, with all the aradama I&#x27;ve gotten to see and the data to collect.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Ah.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> (This person too... She&#x27;s dangerous after all!)<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> (I don&#x27;t know how many times I&#x27;ve thought this now, but... Let this be over already-!)<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I&#x27;m leading this aradama over towards you!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Sure! Don&#x27;t worry about beating &#x27;em, just keep sending more and more aradama-chan my way!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> We&#x27;re only doing it like this for today, okay?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> I&#x27;m more than happy to do this anytime though.<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> Shichinosato-san! Would it be alright for me to send one more aradama at you then?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> I&#x27;ll take any of them you&#x27;ve got!<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Step right up, fresh aradama-chan!<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> (We weren&#x27;t at all able to reach the coordination we were working towards during practice, in the end.)<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> (With Shichinosato-san, we could hardly even take a formation.)<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Honestly... You&#x27;re only paying attention to the aradama that come right in front of you.<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> (But outside of practice, Shichinosato-san is like a different person.)<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> (And Musumi-san, understanding her nature, smoothly supports her while fighting the aradama.)<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> I can&#x27;t let myself lose here either... can I.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Great work, everyone-. Today was a little rough on us, huh.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Were you in charge of leading a different group, Iwakura-san?<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Mmhm. I was working together with the people from my group to stop the aradama from leaving the predicted area, and also helping escort anyone who couldn&#x27;t evacuate on time.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> I wouldn&#x27;t really be able to do that.<br>
<strong>Sanae:</strong> Everyone has their own role. I wouldn&#x27;t be able to fight like you can either, Itomi-san.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Sayaka. Since there were so many aradama, you must have taken out a lot of them, right?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> I stopped remembering how many halfway.<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> If we&#x27;re comparing numbers, you would have gotten the most, wouldn&#x27;t you?<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Probably-. I got to play with so many aradama-chan I couldn&#x27;t even keep up counting, so I&#x27;m satisfied.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> I&#x27;ve got her to thank for that too.<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> Suu wouldn&#x27;t feel so fortunate though... You really do love to fight aradama, don&#x27;t you.<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> I can&#x27;t overlook that you ignored both orders and the unit&#x27;s formation, but adaptability is a necessity, and I admire your dedication to the mission.<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> I suppose it&#x27;s fine so long as you don&#x27;t cause any trouble for the girls you&#x27;re assigned to work with.<br>
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Heh, Kiyoka can handle it so it&#x27;s all good.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> I don&#x27;t know how many times I thought I was going to die today... I mean it, I&#x27;m on my last legs.<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> Though, since you weren&#x27;t hurt in the end, it turned out fine.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> No way; this time was bad enough that I want a special vacation or something. My heart took more than enough damage!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> What&#x27;s this? I&#x27;d heard Inami was about to drop from exhaustion, but you look lively enough to me.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Shidou-san!? D-Did you need something from us?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Nothing in particular. Just checking in on the toji who took part in the mission.<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> You elite guard must have had your hands full too. Though, there&#x27;s something on my mind. Mind if I ask you?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Go right ahead.<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> Whichever way you look at it, don&#x27;t you think the group Suu and I were put in had an excessive amount of fighting strength?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Ahh, that&#x27;s what you mean. The plan was always to make one team of more average ability and one with more capable fighters.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Just in order to counter any powerful aradama that appeared. On top of that, there were a lot of unique individuals, so it was Suzuka&#x27;s thinking that having them all in one place would make them easier to manage.<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> ...Because of that, we had a lot of trouble.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> And I... I ended up being some kind of aradama bait... It was the worst.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ...That must have been difficult. Though, while the average level of students chosen for this training was high, not many could keep up with that group you were in.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Knowing you two, I suggested you. And, it doesn&#x27;t look like I was wrong.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Sigh... Just because I can use utsushi a little more than usual, I wish you wouldn&#x27;t forget how weak I am...<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> I... I want to see how many times you can apply utsushi.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> I-Itomi-sama!? How long have you been here for!?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Not long. I saw you from the front entrance.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> But, why are you using &quot;sama&quot;? I&#x27;m... not that important.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Itomi-sama... You&#x27;re way too strong, aren&#x27;t you... So that&#x27;s why!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> There are toji stronger than me. ...You can call me Sayaka.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> No no no... There&#x27;s no way I could say your name that bluntly! At least let me use Sayaka-san!!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Alright. And... How many more times can you apply utsushi, Suu? I want to see.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> How many more times...? I&#x27;m all out of stock for today, so I can&#x27;t show you any more utsushis!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> That&#x27;s a shame...<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> But, we go to the same school. I&#x27;ll look forward to when we go on missions together.<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> It&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s any fun to see either...<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Hokuto-san, why do you look like you&#x27;re enjoying this. You&#x27;re a bully.<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> That&#x27;s not what I was smiling about. I was just thinking, it might have been difficult, but this was a good experience for you.<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> If nothing comes up, I won&#x27;t be leaving for another two days, so do you want to go out somewhere and enjoy ourselves tomorrow?<br>
<strong>Suu:</strong> Absolutely! I&#x27;ll start coming up with a list of places to go right now!<br>
<strong>Hokuto:</strong> You really do change moods at the drop of a hat, don&#x27;t you.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations/edit/docs/North_and_South_Swordsman_Record.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_2_ui" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_3DPF"></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"></div></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_35-E thin-scrollbar"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#1-in-order-to-overcome-these-hardships" class="table-of-contents__link">1: In Order to Overcome These Hardships!</a></li><li><a href="#2-this-was-supposed-to-be-my-day-off-to-recharge" class="table-of-contents__link">2: This Was Supposed to Be My Day off to Recharge...</a></li><li><a href="#3-before-i-knew-it-i-was-with-three-heijou-institute-girls" class="table-of-contents__link">3: Before I Knew it, I was With Three Heijou Institute Girls!</a></li><li><a href="#4-joint-training-it-started" class="table-of-contents__link">4: Joint Training...
