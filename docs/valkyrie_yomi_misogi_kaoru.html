Here, over here~.  
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I could tell where you were without you having to shout.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> You just looked like you were kinda spacing out over there. Anyway, ready to go?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I was wondering where you were taking me. A cakery?<br><strong>Akira:</strong> What's wrong with that? The limited run parfaits this place makes get a lot of talk for being good.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> You still like parfaits like you used to.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> So, what was the reason you called me here for?<br><strong>Akira:</strong> I had a little something to take care of around here. So I thought I'd give you a call. It's no fun eating by yourself, right?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> ......<br><strong>Akira:</strong> I know you've probably got a lot going on too, but you've gotta take a breather every now and then.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I have to be part of a promotional photo shoot later today, so I can't stay here for very long.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Huhh? What're you doing a photo shoot for?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> You could say it has to do with the results of the Miss Five Traditions competition that was held the other day, I suppose.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Ahh, oh yeah, they put those out, huh.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> That reminds me, didn't you place pretty high yourself? I was surprised to hear it. I never thought you'd be up there.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Though, it must be boring as hell to sit through some photo shoot cause of it.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I can't neglect this, considering it's part of my duties as a toji.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> You got so straight laced. But, if that's what you're set on. You better do it right.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> You gonna be doing it in your uniform? They'd probably get mad if you wore something too casual; so a jacket like mine's out.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> You're probably right. Though, this time it's arranged for me to wear a valkyrie themed costume, along with Tsubakuro-san and the others.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> ......<br><strong>Akira:</strong> What're you talking about?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> You may not know about it, Akira, but valkyries were something that was part of Norse mythology--<br><strong>Akira:</strong> It's not like I don't know what valkyries are...! I'm asking, why're they making you dress up like that...!?  
<strong>Yomi:</strong> That's what I'd like to know.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Yeah, I guess... The bureau does say to do some ridiculous stuff sometimes, huh.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> ...Well, do what you can. Whatever you're buying here'll be my treat.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Then, I'll have some tea. The black tea here is fairly good; it goes well with sweet foods.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> I'll have the same thing you're drinking then.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Ah, when you get the photos back, lemme see. Those'll be fun to look through for sure.  </p><h2 id="valkyrie---yomi-end-this-one-is-my-favorite" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Valkyrie - Yomi: End]: This One is My Favorite</h2><p><strong>Akira:</strong> Yo! It's rare for you to call me to hang out.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I got the photos back from that photo shoot we spoke about the other day.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I think they'll be published online soon, but I had heard you were coming by on an assignment.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Cool; let me just put my bike away. Wait here a minute.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> So, how'd that photo shoot turn out anyway?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Like this.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Whoa-!? The hell... You're looking way too cool in this.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> That sharp look on your face is great. It came out really damn nice.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I didn't expect you to praise it so much.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Why not? Of course I would if it turned out this good.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> That's true. Though, I expected you to make fun of me.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Yeah, if I'm being honest, I was planning to, until I actually saw this. This whole valkyrie thing came out of nowhere.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> But this seems like it'll get some attention. Especially if Tsubakuro Yume and Kanami and the others are doing it.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> You got any other shots of you in this?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> No. This is the only one I brought with me.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> That's too bad. I really like the look of this one.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I see. I wasn't sure which photo to bring myself, so the others in the special defense team picked it out for me.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Huh. Didn't think you were so close with them, Yomi.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Does that mean you're pushing omusubi on them too?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Sometimes... I do.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> The omusubi you make are weirdly good, y'know. Somehow, just talking about them made me hungry.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> I'm thinking of getting something to eat here, but, what about you?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I'd like to join you, but I've already made plans.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> With the special defense team?<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> Yes.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Guess there's no helping that. We didn't get to see each other much, but I had fun today.<br><strong>Yomi:</strong> I did too. Then, until next time.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> She's working real hard for her buddies, huh.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Alright... I've gotta stick to it too.<br><a href="https://youtu.be/A4RipDwmT9Y">https://youtu.be/A4RipDwmT9Y</a></p><h2 id="misogi---kaoru-start-a-little-about-the-past" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Misogi - Kaoru: Start]: A Little About the Past</h2><p><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Today's kinda hot, isn't it-... My water bottle's already run dry...<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Ne~~...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I only have a little bit left in mine, but, want to drink it, Kaoru?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Gladly. Or at least, I'd want to, but, if you ran out of yours, that'd be bad too.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Should we make a trip back to town then? We'd be losing a lot of time though.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Ellen-san, Kaoru-san. It's alright. I brought lots of drinks with me.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Chie, thank you so much!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> It's nice somebody came prepared. You really saved us. [gulp gulp]... Phwah. Can't thank you enough.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> It's just a part of me acting as everyone's onee-san.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Have you been an onee-san ever since you were a little girl, Chie?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> When I was little, I spent most of my time together with Mihono-chan, so it's true that back then I wanted to try hard to act as an onee-san.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Though I'm not sure it went too well at first.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Well, there's no way you could've been the same as a kid. But we all depend on you the way you are now.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> That's right; Chie's our reliable onee-san.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> By the way, I've never really asked you about it before, Kaoru, but, what were you like as a little girl?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Ah, I'd like to hear about that too.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Give me a break...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Don't be like that. Do it for meee.<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Nenenene~. Ne~ne.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Nene-chan's asking for it too, see?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Kh... Letting her hold you like that; you're totally on her side now...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> I'll tell you about it, but it's not all that interesting, okay?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I don't believe that for a minute, Kaoru! I have a feeling this'll be very interesting!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Anyway, when I was little, I was a real brat. I used to play with kids around the neighborhood, and I sorta ended up in the position of leading them around.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> That's a little unexpected.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> It just sort of happened after I'd stand up for the ones who got left out or got messed with.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Maybe it's cause I was hooked on the heroes you'd see in tokusatsu shows-.<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Nene!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> You still like tokusatsu heroes now too, don't you, Kaoru-. Did aim towards becoming a toji ever since back then?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> I guess-. I know you know, but the Mashikos are a toji family, so my mom and grandma were both toji too. I respected it because of that, or maybe looked up to it.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Becoming a toji meant you got to defeat aradama, after all.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> What else were you like?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> What else-; when I was a kid, I played with my grandpa a lot too. I always felt at ease being around him.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Since I love my grandpa too, that makes us the same~.  
<strong>Chie:</strong> I'd imagine you always got along with Nene-chan too, right?<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Ne!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> About Nene...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Before we can talk about that, it looks like we've got work to do. There's a reading on the spectrum finder.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Guess we'd better hurry-.<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Nene~!  </p><h2 id="misogi---kaoru-end-together-with-nene" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>[Misogi - Kaoru: End]: Together With Nene</h2><p><strong>Ellen:</strong> Kaoru! Behind you!<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> KSHAAAAAA!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> !?  
<strong>Nene:</strong> NENE--!!<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> GGGII...!<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Ne! Nenene-- NEEEE-......<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Nene-chan!?  
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Damnit...!!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Outta my way! KIEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Is Nene okay!?  
<strong>Nene:</strong> ......<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> You can relax, Kaoru. He's only passed out.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Oh...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> You really do treasure Nene-chan, don't you.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> He's family. I don't want him to get hurt anymore.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> All the more because, in the past, I hurt Nene once...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Eh...?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Something like that happened between you and Nene...?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> I told you before, I looked up to toji. But, there was also a time I didn't want to be a Mashiko toji.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> I'm not proud of it, but that was my rebellious phase.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...I didn't want to work as a toji who killed aradama, so I hated it.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> But, since I was a girl from the Mashiko family... There's no way I could just not be one. It's not like I could go against Grandma and everybody.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...So I got way too fed up with it and started lashing out.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...Seeing me taking my anger out on stuff, Nene came and tried to calm me down... I hit him by mistake.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> And... really hard, too...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> That's...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Kaoru...<br><strong>Nene:</strong> ......<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> If people won't get hurt, wouldn't it be fine to let aradama be around?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> I want to make the world a place where nobody hates aradama, including this guy here.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I see. I completely agree with that viewpoint of yours, Kaoru!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> A world where neither aradama or people hurt each other... I'd like that to be a reality someday.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> And, as a symbol of that, when the time comes, let's make an Aradama Park!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Eh?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Kuku... Now there's an idea. We can quit being toji and kick back and relax at Aradama Park.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> I smell trouble brewing...<br><strong>Nene:</strong> ...Ne?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Oh, you're up? You overslept a little, but I'll forgive you this once.<br><strong>Nene:</strong> Nee??<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> You're gonna be the park's main attraction, after all.
