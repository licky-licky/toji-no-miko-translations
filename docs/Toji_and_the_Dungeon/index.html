Whenever I&#x27;m training, that&#x27;s always on my mind.<br>
Still, what should I be doing besides swinging my okatana? What should I be doing besides polishing what I already know? Is there something else, something I&#x27;m missing?<br>
Again and again, I can&#x27;t get it out of my mind. But I still haven&#x27;t found the answer...</p><p><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Jeez. They said there&#x27;s a huge outbreak of aradama in these hills, but the spectrum finder hasn&#x27;t picked up anything since we got here. Yoo, Hiyori, how&#x27;s your thing doing?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Nn? Ahh... My spectrum meter hasn&#x27;t reacted either.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Hmm, this is strange. The report said they were right around here.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> You think maybe, they ran away...?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> But, the STT officers have the area surrounded. If they saw something, surely they&#x27;d call us about it...<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Hey, why don&#x27;t we just head back to the command post and check? We&#x27;re only wasting our time walking in circles out here.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...You&#x27;re right. That&#x27;s probably for the best.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Okay. You lead the way, Kiyoka.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Alright. Umm, if I remember right, the command post was this way... ...Huh? What&#x27;s that sound?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Uhh, beats me? Actually, can you feel the ground shaking?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> You two, watch where you&#x27;re standing! The ground&#x27;s collapsing!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Eh...? Wah, kyaaaaaaa-!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Kiyoka...! Ah, I&#x27;m falling tooooooo!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Whoahh, it&#x27;s even happening over here!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Ahh, I can&#x27;t escape!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Kh... If I use jin&#x27;i...!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> N-No use... My balance...!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ..................ugh...<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Oh, Hiyori&#x27;s awake.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Juujou-san, are you okay!? Did you get hurt anywhere!?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Ahh, I&#x27;m fine... But, where are we...?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> We&#x27;re in some kind of cave system.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> But, it&#x27;s weird... The ground under our feet collapsed, yet...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> There&#x27;s no hole in the ceiling...!?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> That&#x27;s not all that&#x27;s weird. Take a look around the cave. Isn&#x27;t it strangely bright in here?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Now that you mention it... Those crystals have some kind of glow to them. What do you think they are...?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> We can&#x27;t get through to call for rescue, and it&#x27;s anyone&#x27;s guess which way we should go to get out... Aghh, why does this have to happen to me.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Huh? Any of you guys hear that?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That sound... It sounds like someone&#x27;s fighting!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Nnn? Aren&#x27;t we supposed to be the only toji out here?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Then maybe that&#x27;s our rescue.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Whoever they are, we can&#x27;t ignore them. Let&#x27;s go, everyone.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> They&#x27;re close! Right up ahead!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I think I see them...! Wait, huhhh!?<br>

<strong>Aradama:</strong> GUAAAAAA...<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> W-W-W-Wh-What the hell!?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> There&#x27;s a beautiful girl in armor, and an elf, and magic!!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Magic...!? That&#x27;s not real though...!?<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> GUAAAAAA!<br>
<strong>???:</strong> Ais-san, there&#x27;s more of them!<br>
<strong>Ais:</strong> Get back, Lefiya... I&#x27;ll get rid of these monsters...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Look out! They&#x27;re getting surrounded!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> If we use jin&#x27;i, we can get there in time!

<strong>Ais:</strong> ...!<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> GUOOOOOO...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> That&#x27;s amazing! The rest of the aradama were beaten in no time!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Yeah... I can&#x27;t believe what I&#x27;m seeing. She used the wind to cut them up.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> It&#x27;s actual real magic power!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Seems like they didn&#x27;t need our help after all...<br>
<strong>Ais:</strong> Phew...<br>
<strong>Lefiya:</strong> That was fantastic, Ais-sama! Nicely done!<br>
<strong>Ais:</strong> Nn, you too, Lefiya... And the rest of you too...<br>
<strong>Lefiya:</strong> Thank you for your assistance. And, those weapons... Did you come from the far east, by any chance?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Far... East...?<br>
<strong>Ais:</strong> ...?<br>
<strong>Lefiya:</strong> Eh? Am I wrong?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Ah, uhh, that&#x27;s right. We&#x27;re from the far east alright, you can&#x27;t mistake it.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Oi, Kaoru...!?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Just play along for now. I&#x27;ve got no clue what&#x27;s going on, but if we cause some misunderstanding these two could be big trouble for us, okay?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Well, you have a point...<br>
<strong>Lefiya:</strong> We received a request from the guild, to investigate those monsters we were fighting just now... What brings all of you here?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Right. We got a request from the guild too, to investigate the a... The monsters, you know.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Yeah, yeah. But, while we were investigating, we got lost. I hate to ask, but could you help show us the way back out?<br>
<strong>Lefiya:</strong> Adventurers like yourselves got lost this close to the entrance...?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> I know, right! But all of us have a terrible sense of direction!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Wow...! They just keep lying their way through everything...!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Shhh. Don&#x27;t say that so loud, Hono-chan.<br>
<strong>Lefiya:</strong> A bad sense of direction...? Hmm... Ais-san, what should we do?<br>
<strong>Ais:</strong> Nn, we should head up too... We&#x27;ve finished our investigation, after all...<br>
<strong>Lefiya:</strong> That&#x27;s true. Very well then, everyone. It&#x27;s this way. We can exit together.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Ah... Thanks, and sorry to bother you.<br>
<strong>Lefiya:</strong> It&#x27;s no bother, Ais-sa--<br>
<strong>Lefiya:</strong> --You&#x27;re not Ais-sama!? I&#x27;m so sorry, I mistook you for her!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...How?<br>
<strong>Lefiya:</strong> We&#x27;re going to make our report to the guild now, but what will you all do?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> We were supposed to meet somewhere else first, so we&#x27;ll stop by the guild later.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> That&#x27;s right!<br>
<strong>Lefiya:</strong> I see. Then, we&#x27;ll be parting here. Let&#x27;s go, Ais-san.<br>
<strong>Ais:</strong> Nn...<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> ...Are they gone?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> All clear.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Then there&#x27;s no point holding it in anymore...<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> What the hell&#x27;s going on around hereeee!? Where the hell are we anywayyyyy!?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> I&#x27;m about to have a panic attack! Actually, I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ve been having one this whole time!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Wawa, calm down, you two! Though it&#x27;s not like I can calm down either!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Elves, magic, guilds, monsters, adventurers... And the outside world looks like this... I think, maybe, we...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Did you figure something out, Kiyoka?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Umm... Normally you wouldn&#x27;t expect something like this to happen, but I read about it in novels a lot... We might have been sent to a parallel world...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Parallel world...?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Oi oi, seriously...?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> But, why? Weren&#x27;t we just on a hillside?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Well... When that hole opened under us, it might have been a link to another world, I think...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Then, how are we supposed to get back to our world?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Um... I don&#x27;t know that much, exactly...<br>
<strong>???:</strong> Wawawa, what&#x27;re you doing? Come on, let go of me!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Nn? What&#x27;s going on?<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> GUAAAAAA!<br>
<strong>???:</strong> Hyaaaa! I&#x27;m under attackkkk!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Oh no! Those aradama are dragging that girl into the tower!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Wait, isn&#x27;t that were we just came from!?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Let&#x27;s get after them! We have to save her before we lose sight of them!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="3-goddess-hestia"></a>3: Goddess Hestia<a class="hash-link" href="#3-goddess-hestia" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>???:</strong> Oh boy, you girls saved me. I never expected to get attacked by monsters while I was working this part time job.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> As long as you&#x27;re safe. By the way, who are you...?<br>
<strong>???:</strong> I haven&#x27;t introduced myself yet, have I? I&#x27;m Hestia. As you can see, I&#x27;m a goddess!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> A... Goddess...?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Err, you&#x27;re working a part time job even though you&#x27;re a goddess?<br>
<strong>Hestia:</strong> Uuu... There&#x27;s a really good reason for that. But it&#x27;d take a while to explain, so you&#x27;ll just have to trust me.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Oi, Kiyoka. Is she really a goddess? I mean, normally speaking, she does have a pretty ridiculous body type.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I-I don&#x27;t think her body matters... But this is a parallel world, so anything could be possible.<br>
<strong>Hestia:</strong> Hmm? What&#x27;re you whispering about? And, now that I look closer, I&#x27;ve never seen anyone like you before...<br>
<strong>Hestia:</strong> ...Oh, I think I get it. Hmmhmm. I see, that&#x27;s how it is.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Nn? That&#x27;s how it is, what&#x27;s how it is?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> D-Don&#x27;t look at me...?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> By the way, Hestia. Could you tell us about what&#x27;s been going on in this town? We&#x27;re, um, ahh, how should I put it...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> We just came back from a long journey, so we aren&#x27;t up to date on how things have been going.<br>
<strong>Hestia:</strong> Hmm, a long journey, huh? Okay. Well I&#x27;ll go with that explanation for now.<br>
<strong>Hestia:</strong> In that case, you girls must be surprised too, right? These past few days, this town&#x27;s lost a lot of its liveliness.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Lost its liveliness...?<br>
<strong>Hestia:</strong> Well you know, this town is made up of merchants and the adventurers who get compensated by them to defeat the monsters in the dungeon, right?<br>
<strong>Hestia:</strong> But a few days ago, those weird monsters from before are the only thing people can find in the dungeon.<br>
<strong>Hestia:</strong> Even when you beat them, they don&#x27;t drop any items that can be turned in for money at the guild. So now the adventurers have had their supply of income cut off.<br>
<strong>Hestia:</strong> Thanks to them, it&#x27;s a mad dash for any part time jobs people can grab around town. Even my darling Bell-kun is out working against his will, far away from home...<br>
<strong>Hestia:</strong> Awww... Bell-kun, come back and see me soon...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Sounds like the aradama are putting the people here through a really hard time.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> I guess that&#x27;s why the two we met in the dungeon before were investigating them.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah, then maybe...!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Did you figure something out, Kiyoka?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Yes. I think we might have been brought here to eliminate those aradama. So, once we clear them all out...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I get it! Then we can go back to our world!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah, but... Before we get sent back home, I kinda want to see for myself what they have around this world...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Even if it&#x27;s just once, I want to use magic.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Oh! Good idea! Don&#x27;t you think so, Hiyoyon?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> I... Both the okatana and training my mother left me are all that I need...<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Look at you, acting all serious. You know you can tell us you&#x27;re way more into it than anyone, right? I saw the way your eyes were glued to them when they were casting magic back there.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Th-That was...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Um, Hestia-sama? How would we go about using magic? None of us know how to...<br>
<strong>Hestia:</strong> Hmm, magic, huh. There&#x27;s a technique to it, but... Nn?<br>
<strong>Hestia:</strong> Hello there? Who&#x27;s feeling up my butt?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Butt? It isn&#x27;t one of us.<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> KISHAAAAAA-!<br>
<strong>Hestia:</strong> Wawawa, there&#x27;s another more! Hey, let go! Uhyaaa, I&#x27;m being kidnappedddddd! Outsiders, h-h-help meeeee!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Ahh!? She got carried into the dungeon again!?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Besides that, she called us &quot;outsiders&quot; just now...<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> They just keep going straight for that goddess, don&#x27;t they?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Aradama were enshrined as gods in the past, so maybe they think she&#x27;s one of their friends?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Save it for later! We need to get Hestia back right now!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="4-the-little-guide"></a>4: The Little Guide<a class="hash-link" href="#4-the-little-guide" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Hestia:</strong> I can&#x27;t thank you enough, really. Guess I shouldn&#x27;t be going anywhere near the dungeon for a while.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> That&#x27;s probably a good idea...<br>
<strong>Hestia:</strong> Still, you girls... Like I thought, you seem used to fighting those monsters.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Eh? You can tell?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> And weren&#x27;t you calling us &quot;outsiders&quot; before...?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> So did you figure out that we&#x27;re from another world?<br>
<strong>Hestia:</strong> Fufu, didn&#x27;t I tell you? I&#x27;m a goddess. I knew all about that right from the start.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> So then, the one who called us to this world is...<br>
<strong>Hestia:</strong> Wait wait, that wasn&#x27;t me. Gods using their powers on the lower world is off limits, as a rule.<br>
<strong>Hestia:</strong> Though with the way things are around here, it&#x27;s causing problems between the gods too, so one of them besides me might have tried getting clever with the rules.<br>
<strong>Hestia:</strong> Anyway, with that out in the open, just what are you outsiders? I can tell a lot, but not quite that much. And can you tell me what you know about those monsters too?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Sorry for keeping this a secret from you, Hestia. In our world, we&#x27;re known as &quot;toji&quot;.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> And those monsters are &quot;aradama&quot;. They&#x27;re native to our world.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Our job as toji is to defeat aradama. But when we were on a mission doing that, we fell in a hole... When we woke up, we somehow came into this world.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> We don&#x27;t know how the aradama got here either.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Still, at the very least, it seems pretty likely one of the gods summoned us here.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Right. These &quot;okatana&quot; we&#x27;re using have the power to purify any aradama.<br>
<strong>Hestia:</strong> Mmmmm...!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> O-Oi... Is something wrong, goddess?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Did you get a stomachache?<br>
<strong>Hestia:</strong> Then that means, you outsiders really are my savior!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Uwah, that made me jump!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Your savior...? What are you saying, Hestia?<br>
<strong>Hestia:</strong> I mean, you are, aren&#x27;t you? You&#x27;re here to defeat those arawhatevers, which means...<br>
<strong>Hestia:</strong> Once the dungeon&#x27;s back to normal, my darling Bell-kun will come back home!<br>
<strong>Hestia:</strong> If that doesn&#x27;t make you my saviors, what would!?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> O-Okay... No, I don&#x27;t get it at all.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> But it&#x27;s plain as day how happy she is about it.<br>
<strong>Hestia:</strong> Go ahead and ask me for anything you need, foreginers! If it&#x27;ll help you get rid of those arawhatevers, I&#x27;d be happy to lend a helping hand or two!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> W-Will you really!? Then, can you teach us how to use magic!?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> (Can we actually use it too...?)<br>
<strong>Hestia:</strong> Ah, sorry. I can&#x27;t teach you how to do that so suddenly.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> O-Oh, okay...<br>
<strong>Hestia:</strong> Yeah, but is there anything else?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...How about this. Our number one problem in clearing out the aradama is that none of us know our way around the dungeon.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah, you&#x27;re right about that. The moment we got in there we got lost.<br>
<strong>Hestia:</strong> Hmmhmm... Then you want me to find a guide for you?<br>
<strong>Hestia:</strong> Leave it to me! I know just the person who can help you!<br>
<strong>Lilly:</strong> Now then, everyone, will you follow me. Ah, I&#x27;m Liliruca Arde. You can call me Lilly.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Sh-She&#x27;s a kid...?<br>
<strong>Lilly:</strong> I am not a kid. I&#x27;m from a race known as the Pallum. For what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;m 15.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Eh-!? She&#x27;s older than me!?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> She looks like that, but she&#x27;s almost me and Ellen&#x27;s age... Seriously?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Mmm, it&#x27;s a parallel world after all.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Um, by the way, Lilly...<br>
<strong>Lilly:</strong> Yes, what is it?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Can you... Use magic too?<br>
<strong>Lilly:</strong> Yes, a bit. Though it&#x27;s not the kind that&#x27;s useful in combat.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Then, what kind of magic is it? Is it like the kind that lets you fly through the air?<br>
<strong>Lilly:</strong> No, it&#x27;s nothing that impressive...<br>
<strong>Lilly:</strong> I guess... This is a secret from everyone besides Bell-sama and them, but since you&#x27;re all from another world, I think I can tell you. However, please keep this a secret from anyone else you meet here.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Okay, we won&#x27;t tell anybody!<br>
<strong>Lilly:</strong> I use transformation magic. So long as my body stays mostly the same size, I can transform myself to look like anything I want.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> I see, there&#x27;s transformation magic...<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> What&#x27;s wrong, Hiyori? I thought you said you weren&#x27;t interested in magic?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> N-No... It&#x27;s not like that...<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> I can understand though. If you could use transformation magic, you could do something to cover up that eternal part of yours.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Kh... I&#x27;m done talking about this. We need to keep moving forward. We don&#x27;t have time to talk if we want to destroy all the aradama deeper in.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="5-a-bad-feeling-and-jagamaru-kun"></a>5: A Bad Feeling and Jagamaru-kun<a class="hash-link" href="#5-a-bad-feeling-and-jagamaru-kun" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Haaaaah-!<br>

<strong>Lilly:</strong> You&#x27;re all so strong! You completely overpowered those mosnters!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Still, the spectrum meter is reacting to something. We aren&#x27;t done here.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I don&#x27;t see any more aradama around though...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Kaoru, does your spectrum finder show anything?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Yeah, I&#x27;m checking it now... Tch, so that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s going to be.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Nn? What&#x27;s wrong?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> They&#x27;re down, below us. It&#x27;s picking something up under here. And it looks like there&#x27;s loads of &#x27;em.<br>
<strong>Lilly:</strong> There&#x27;s dozens of floors to this dungeon, so they must be deeper in.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> There&#x27;s that many floors...!?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Don&#x27;t worry. As far as I can tell from this thing, we shouldn&#x27;t have to go that deep. Though they also don&#x27;t seem to be right next to us... They couldn&#x27;t make it easy.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Are you feeling tired, Kaoru?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Yeah... There&#x27;s open spaces here and there, but fighting in these cramped tunnels can take a lot of extra effort from me.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Nenekirimaru&#x27;s no good for fighting in here, huh. It&#x27;s true that if you went all out, you&#x27;d cause more trouble than it&#x27;s worth.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> There&#x27;s a lot of side tunnels as well, so you never know where aradama could come from... It&#x27;s mentally exhausting...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> I know what you mean...<br>
<strong>Lilly:</strong> Would you all like to take a break here? With that little glowing rock of yours you can tell if the monsters come near us, right?<br>
<strong>Lilly:</strong> And also, it&#x27;s a rule we follow to avoid exhaustion at all costs. Because in the worst case scenario, it means you might be unable to come back out.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...I see. Thank you, Lilly. Let&#x27;s take a quick break, everyone.<br>
<strong>Lilly:</strong> In that case, I can provide you with food and drinks. It&#x27;s another rule of the dungeon to recover properly as you progress.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Whoa, this is yummy! The outside is cold and crunchy, but the inside&#x27;s still nice and hot!<br>
<strong>Lilly:</strong> Those are Jagamaru-kun, which Hestia-sama herself gives all of us to eat.<br>
<strong>Lilly:</strong> Please try a drink of this as well. It&#x27;s effective in recovering your stamina.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Gulp, gulp... Phwaa-! Ahh, I feel alive again-!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You know, the adventurers really are amazing. I can&#x27;t believe they always come down into the dungeon like this. And you too, Lilly-san, supporting them like this.<br>
<strong>Lilly:</strong> Ehehe, you think so? Though I think it&#x27;s equally amazing the way you&#x27;ve been able to adapt coming down here for your first time.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> You&#x27;re such a good girl, Lilly. I wish we could take you back to our world.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Uh, I think that would cause problems...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Anyway, Lilly. Could you tell us a bit more about the dungeon we&#x27;re in now?<br>
<strong>Lilly:</strong> Ah, I can do that. Where should I start.<br>
<strong>Lilly:</strong> As I told you before, this dungeon is structured in a way with many dozens of floors. We are currently on the first floor.<br>
<strong>Lilly:</strong> And as you go deeper in the dungeon, the area of each floor grows larger. For that reason, exploring each layer becomes more and more difficult.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Oh. So that&#x27;s why you said it&#x27;s important not to waste your stamina as you keep going.<br>
<strong>Lilly:</strong> Right. Ordinarily, the early floors have weaker monsters, while the stronger monsters are only found the deeper you go. However, those monsters are unthinkably strong to be appearing on the first floor.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> And according to the spectrum finder, there&#x27;s a lot more waiting for us up ahead.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Nn? Hang on... What if the aradama keep getting tougher the deeper we go in too...? They shouldn&#x27;t, right?<br>
<strong>Lilly:</strong> I have no way of knowing...  The investigation the guild requested only covered the first floor.<br>
<strong>Lilly:</strong> So it&#x27;s unknown how much stronger those monsters could be on the next floors...<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Ughh... This has bad idea written all over it.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Y-Yeah...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Still, we might not be able to return home until we destroy all the aradama...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Lilly, can you give me one of those &quot;Jagamaru-kun&quot; too? It sounds like I&#x27;ll need to build my stamina for the fighting ahead.<br>
<strong>Lilly:</strong> Yes, here you go. There&#x27;s plenty more left, so if any of you want some, feel free to ask.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="6-longing-for-power"></a>6: Longing for Power<a class="hash-link" href="#6-longing-for-power" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Pant... Pant... Pant... Damnit, the aradama really are getting stronger the lower we go...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> And with the floors getting wider, we have to move that much further... It&#x27;s exhausting, isn&#x27;t it...<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> At least this looks like the last floor we need to clear out. I&#x27;m not picking up any aradama lower than this...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Even so, there&#x27;s still lots of them left on this floor...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Wheeze... Wheeze... Wheeze...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Are you okay, Mihono...?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Y-Yeah... I-I can keep fighting...<br>
<strong>Lilly:</strong> Everyone, you can&#x27;t push yourselves to your limits. Why don&#x27;t we return to the last floor, where it&#x27;s safe, and have another break...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Ahh, we should... Nn? What? The spectrum meter is having a big reaction to something?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Not good, Hiyori! The aradama started moving in our direction! On top of that, I&#x27;m picking up a really big one in the middle of them!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Kh... We have to hurry, all of you!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It&#x27;s no use! The aradama are already here!<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> GUAAAAAAAAAA-!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Shit! They&#x27;re coming from all sides!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Tch, what got their attention so fast...!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> You don&#x27;t think they were luring us in, do you...!?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> W-We have to fight, guys...! We can&#x27;t afford to lose here...!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Hono-chan...! Right, I can still...!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Yeah! Let&#x27;s show them what we&#x27;ve got!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> We&#x27;re not about to lose to some aradama!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Everyone...!<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> GURURURURUR...!<br>
<strong>Lilly:</strong> There&#x27;s monsters in every direction! Be careful, all of you!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Lilly, stay in the center of us! Form a ring! Don&#x27;t show them your backs!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> (But... In our exhausted state, taking on this many aradama will be...)<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> (What do we do... Is there something we haven&#x27;t thought of...? At this rate, before long...)<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> (Damnit... If only I were stronger...!)<br>
<strong>Lilly:</strong> H-Here they come!<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> GUGAAAAAAAAAAAA-!!<br>

<strong>Aradama:</strong> OOOOOooooo...<br>
<strong>Lefiya:</strong> Everyone, are you unhurt!?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Ah... You two...!<br>
<strong>Ais:</strong> Hestia-sama asked us to help you... This time, it&#x27;s our turn to...<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Ais and Lefiya, right? We owe that goddess big time.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> For sure! You showed up in the nick of time!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Hono-chan, we can do it now...!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah, with those two with us...!<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Let&#x27;s go, everyone! If we all work together, we should be able to defeat every aradama here!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="7-asking-for-the-impossible"></a>7: Asking for the Impossible<a class="hash-link" href="#7-asking-for-the-impossible" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yaaaaaah-!<br>

<strong>Hiyori:</strong> No, that&#x27;s not it...<br>
<strong>Ais:</strong> Then what is...? With how strong you are, you should have been able to beat that...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> How strong I am...?<br>
<strong>Ais:</strong> Nn... I can&#x27;t move like you can. You&#x27;re so much faster...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Are you talking about &quot;jin&#x27;i&quot;?<br>
<strong>Ais:</strong> Maybe...<br>
<strong>Ais:</strong> Ever since I saw you fight the first time, I&#x27;ve been thinking about it... How can I move like you did...<br>
<strong>Ais:</strong> I&#x27;m jealous of that strength of yours...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> No, I&#x27;m the one feeling jealous of you.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> If I could use magic the way you do... I know now&#x27;s not the time to get caught up in thought... But still, I can&#x27;t help it...<br>
<strong>Ais:</strong> We&#x27;re both alike, I think... We both want to become stronger...<br>
<strong>Ais:</strong> But, like I have my strength, you have yours... What we&#x27;ve experienced is completely different...<br>
<strong>Ais:</strong> So, your strength is inside... Umm...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Strength has to come from within... You mean? Ahh, you might be right about that.<br>
<strong>Ais:</strong> Nn...<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> GUGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-!!!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Listen to that roar...! That aradama&#x27;s not like the others!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Tch, is it time for the boss fight already?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Kh... If we want to stand a chance of beating that, we&#x27;ll have to deal with the surrounding aradama first.<br>
<strong>Ais:</strong> Don&#x27;t worry... We&#x27;ll take care of any of the other monsters in your way...<br>
<strong>Ais:</strong> Lefiya, can you help me...?<br>
<strong>Lefiya:</strong> Of course, Ais-san! I&#x27;ll begin chanting!<br>
<strong>Lefiya:</strong> Proud warrior, snipers of the forest. Take up your bows before the advancing plunderers. Answer the call of your brethren and ready your arrows...<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> GAAAAAAAAA!<br>
<strong>Ais:</strong> I won&#x27;t let you...<br>
<strong>Aradama:</strong> OOOOOooooo...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Everyone, listen to me! Once her magic hits, we need to all attack that aradama at once! Will you match your timing with me!?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Y-Yes...!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Roger!<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Can you make it, Mihono!<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Yep! I&#x27;ll do it!<br>
<strong>Ais:</strong> Lefiya, now...!<br>
<strong>Lefiya:</strong> Tinge them with flame, the lamplight of the forest. Release them, the fire arrows of the fairies. Falling like rain, burn away the savages...<br>
<strong>Lefiya:</strong> Fusillade Fallarica!<br>

We just barely made it safely back outside.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Ughh, I&#x27;m dead tired though. I can&#x27;t believe as soon as we were done with the aradama, this world&#x27;s monsters started coming out.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> It really feels like we made it out by a hair&#x27;s breadth.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> If Lilly-san hadn&#x27;t shown us the shortest route, we would have been in a lot of trouble back there...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Thanks for everything, Lilly-san! You saved our butts!<br>
<strong>Lilly:</strong> Ehehe, this is sort of embarrassing.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> I want to thank you two again as well. You saved us when you arrived. I&#x27;m grateful.<br>
<strong>Ais:</strong> Nn...<br>
<strong>Lefiya:</strong> You&#x27;re welcome, I&#x27;m just glad we were able to help.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah... But, is this going to work? We were in the dungeon, weren&#x27;t we? When we first came to this world.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> O-Oh yeah, we were...! Don&#x27;t tell me, we have to go back in there to get back to our world...<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Oi oi, don&#x27;t joke like that...!<br>
<strong>Hestia:</strong> Fear not. The god who summoned you here wouldn&#x27;t work you all that hard.<br>
<strong>Lilly:</strong> Ah, it&#x27;s Hestia-sama.<br>
<strong>Hestia:</strong> Sorry to put you through that, Supporter-kun. You too, Wallenwhatever-kun and Elf-kun.<br>
<strong>Ais:</strong> No...<br>
<strong>Lefiya:</strong> Dealing with those monsters was very important to us as adventurers, after all.<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> So what now, goddess? How&#x27;re we supposed to get back home?<br>
<strong>Hestia:</strong> Now now, don&#x27;t be in such a rush. Before we get to that, there&#x27;s one thing I want to confirm with you outsiders.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> And what&#x27;s that...?<br>
<strong>Hestia:</strong> Remember, before you went into the dungeon? How you said you wanted to learn magic.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Huh? But... I thought you said you couldn&#x27;t teach us so suddenly?<br>
<strong>Hestia:</strong> Yes, but only so soon.<br>
<strong>Hestia:</strong> You know, with a powerful enough grimoire, just reading it would be enough to let you use magic. Though something like that is too pricey for me to get my hands on.<br>
<strong>Hestia:</strong> But that&#x27;s not the only way to learn.<br>
<strong>Hestia:</strong> Which brings me to my point. Hey, outsiders, how&#x27;d you like to be a part of my familia?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Hestia-sama&#x27;s familia...?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> First off, what&#x27;s a familia?<br>
<strong>Hestia:</strong> It means my household.<br>
<strong>Hestia:</strong> If you were to join my household, I could begin giving you outsiders the grace of gods, Falna.<br>
<strong>Hestia:</strong> Whether or not that&#x27;ll give you magic depends on the person, but if you kept working as an adventurer, you might someday get your hands on a grimoire, you know?<br>
<strong>Hestia:</strong> So, how about it? So long as you promise not to lay a hand on Bell-kun, I&#x27;ll welcome you with open arms.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Umm... I do want to use magic, but...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah... But...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Mmm... It&#x27;s a tempting offer though...<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Yo-? What do you think, Hiyori?<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> I...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> No, I should stop.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> What happened today helped me understand. In order to become stronger, I should improve my own skills first.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Besides, there&#x27;s something I need to do in our world. You all feel the same, don&#x27;t you?<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Well, yeah. Besides, staying behind here as an adventurer sounds like a whole lot of work.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> We&#x27;ve all kind of said it, but I love our world too much to stay, so there&#x27;s nothing I can do but give up on magic.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Me too. I wouldn&#x27;t want Chii-nee to get all worried about me.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Fufu, that&#x27;s right.<br>
<strong>Hestia:</strong> Is that so? Well, I wasn&#x27;t expecting you to go along with it anyway.<br>
<strong>Hestia:</strong> Anyway, this is farewell, outsiders. Oops, looks like it&#x27;s already starting.<br>
<strong>Lilly:</strong> Goodbye, everyone! It made me very happy the way you praised me back then!<br>
<strong>Lefiya:</strong> We need to say our thanks as well! Thank you very much for defeating those monsters, for the sake of this world!<br>
<strong>Ais:</strong> If there&#x27;s ever another chance...<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> Thanks, Ais. It&#x27;s because of you that I was able to reexamine myself. If we ever meet again... I&#x27;ll look forward to it.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...Nn, where are we?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Huh? Why were we sleeping out here?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Now that you mention it...<br>
<strong>Kaoru:</strong> Ahh... I feel like I had a long dream...<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> You did? What a coincidence, I had one too.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> I feel the same way, but... Nothing. I can&#x27;t remember anything about it.<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> (But, that&#x27;s strange...? I suddenly feel the need to train with Kanami...)<br>
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> (Fu... Well, it&#x27;s not so bad once in a while. When I get back, I&#x27;ll ask her.)</p></div><footer class="docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="row"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations/edit/docs/Toji_and_the_Dungeon.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_2_ui" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_13-_"></div></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"></div></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_35-E thin-scrollbar"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#1-awakening-in-a-dungeon" class="table-of-contents__link">1: Awakening in a Dungeon</a></li><li><a href="#2-an-echoing-scream-in-another-world" class="table-of-contents__link">2: An Echoing Scream in Another World</a></li><li><a href="#3-goddess-hestia" class="table-of-contents__link">3: Goddess Hestia</a></li><li><a href="#4-the-little-guide" class="table-of-contents__link">4: The Little Guide</a></li><li><a href="#5-a-bad-feeling-and-jagamaru-kun" class="table-of-contents__link">5: A Bad Feeling and Jagamaru-kun</a></li><li><a href="#6-longing-for-power" class="table-of-contents__link">6: Longing for Power</a></li><li><a href="#7-asking-for-the-impossible" class="table-of-contents__link">7: Asking for the Impossible</a></li><li><a href="#8-time-to-decide" class="table-of-contents__link">8: Time to Decide</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Links</div><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://pastebin.com/LdyviZ8Z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Translator anon&#x27;s pastebin<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Site source code<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Built with Docusaurus.</div></div></div></footer></div>
