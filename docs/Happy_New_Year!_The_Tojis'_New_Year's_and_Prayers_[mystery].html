We successfully cleared out the aradama without incident.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> They went and dragged us into a mission on New Year's morning. Couldn't they give us a special bonus and call it our New Year's money?<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ...<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ...Having seven people is inefficient. Couldn't some of us have been absent or on standby?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> You tell 'em-.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Hm? This is...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> What is it? Did you get some urgent assignment?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> No, you don't need to worry about that. I only received a strange message.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> It caught my attention because the subject is: "Focusing on aradama will help you."<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> What does it say?<br><strong>Suu:</strong> It sounds like spam... Maybe you should just delete it without checking. Ah, I mean... Not that I'm trying to argue with you or anything, Itomi-sama?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> It has no images or URL; only text.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> "If you'd like to know more, first head to '1-middle, 1-down, 4-down, 2-middle, 0-up'. Then, take a picture of the location. Attach it in a response to this message."<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> --That's all it says.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> That's it? It sounded like some kind of code.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...There used to be a lot of ghost stories that started with texts like this, weren't there? You think it doesn't have anything to do with you, but then... It goes like that.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ...I think it's only a prank, but, with the reference to aradama, I can't overlook it.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Well I'm not interested in any aradama, so I just want to go straight home-!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Same. I don't want stick my neck into trouble right after getting out of a mission. I can already tell this won't be worth it.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> See, exactly! Let's go back home!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I just got a message on my phone... Is this a hint?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> "It's a store very popular among certain young girls (they say) What you hold in your hand now is the 'key'." --That's what it says.<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> They're specifically sending messages to us thenn...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> It's suspicious...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> We can't disregard whoever's sending these at this point. Itomi Sayaka, could you show me that hint once more?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Here.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Thank you.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ...A store very popular among certain young girls. I don't know what the "they say" part refers to, but is "1-middle, 1-down, 2-middle, 0-down" the name of the store?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> The other hint: "What you hold in your hand now is the 'key'", does it mean phones?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> You guys... Aren't you a little too fast in switching gears to whatever weird stuff comes up?<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ......Let's just give in and solve this riddle. I'm sure that'll be the most efficient outcome.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> ...But, I wanted to go home-!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> We can go home after we find who sent these messages, so you try your best too, Suu.  </p><h2 id="2-the-hint-is-always-right-beside-you" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>2: The Hint is Always Right Beside You</h2><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> "1-middle, 1-down, 4-down, 2-middle, 0-up"... So, it's numbers, and... What's the up, down, and middle part about? Some kind of location, or direction?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I wonder what rules it's following. They gave a hint that it has to do with our phones, but... Hmm.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Aghh, I keep sending Hokuto-san Happy New Year's texts, but she isn't responding to any-!<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ...That's amazing, Inami-san.<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> You're writing those texts unbelievably fast.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Eh, am I really that fast?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...How are you going that fast pressing the screen so few times?<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ......She's using flick inputs. Inami-san, please demonstrate.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Just watch me!<br><strong>Suu:</strong> With flick inputs, if you want "A", tap A. If you want "Ke", tap Ka and flick it to the right, see? For "O", go down... like that!<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> [clap clap clap]~...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> So, if you tap and keep it right in the middle, you get A sounds. Left gets you I sounds. Up gets U sounds... Right gets E sounds. Down gets O sounds... And you can write like that...?<br><strong>Suu:</strong> You'll mess up at first, but once you get used to it, it's a lot faster.<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ...<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> Excuuse... me. I figured out that code... I think.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Did you, Nitta Hirona? Please explain.<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> Okaay.<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> The numbers in here apply to each line of the Japanese alphabet. 1 is the A column, 2 is the Ka column, 3 is the Sa column, 5 is the Ta column... and so on.<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> "1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0." "A, Ka, Sa, Ta, Na, Ha, Ma, Ya, Ra, Wa." --If you write it out easier to understand, it's like this.<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> And, the middle and down part is, when you use flick input, the direction you flick it.<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> So the directions point to each column of the Japanese alphabet, or which vowel to use in each line...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Oh! You change the input, but you tap the A column and number at the same place!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> When you put it like that, it makes sense.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> So... 1-middle is "A". 1-down is "O". 4-down is "To". 2-middle is "Ka". And last is 0-up, "N". Is that it?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Aoto... kan.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> It's Aoto-kan? It's true that it's popular among certain young girls... Toji like ourselves. And, if the input method on our phones is the key they mentioned, there's no questioning it.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> That place isn't far from here. Guess we should run over there.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Hiyori... I'm surprised to see her getting so into this. Does she actually like this kinda thing?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> If you invite Juujou-san along, she'll come up with some reason to join in.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Well, as long as she's having fun.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> It's closed. Probably should have expected that, since it's New Year's Day.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> For now, let's send a photo of Aoto-kan's exterior as we were instructed.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ...I'm surprised to get a response almost immediately after sending it, but, is this another code?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> --"Head to 111121145's former research facility."<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...The place where the research facility is became numbers?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> They're not making it easy on us, but it sounds like it from how they wrote it. Did you get another hint, Sayaka?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I didn't get one.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Making us do this without a hint is a huge difficulty spike out of nowhere, isn't it-?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah, take a look at this. The paper on the door to Aoto-kan...!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> "Greetings, Happy New Year" ...and afterwards is...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> "1, 15, 20, 15, 11, 1, 14. owner, Aoto Youji."<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> This is likely the same as the previous code.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Do you think this is a hint, maybe? Like... these numbers represent Aoto-kan, or something.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> But, isn't the amount of numbers different...?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> The first question was in hiragana, but this one might be in some other alphabet.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Then, if these numbers do represent Aoto-kan as Musumi Kiyoka suggests, the "1" at the start is very likely "A".<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...This is hard.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> You're supposed to spend New Year's under a kotatsu with mikan. It's basically the law... But this is probably gonna keep us stuck here for a while.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Nn... Wait, it's my phone this time. What now... "The place of origin of certain okatana." What's that about?  </p><h2 id="3-is-cracking-codes-business-as-usual-for-toji" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>3: Is Cracking Codes Business as Usual for Toji?</h2><p><strong>Suu:</strong> "Head to 111121145's former research facility"...<br><strong>Suu:</strong> It says that, but, this code... Does it make any sense at all? I'm hitting max hopelessness here; I can't think of anything anymoreee.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Don't force it, just take it easy-. I feel like passing on this one too.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah--! The amount of numbers here, this has to be it when you write it with the English alphabet...!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> A, O, T, O, K, A, N. With seven of them, you get Aoto-kan.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> So A is 1, then O is 15, T is 20, K is 11, and N is 14?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Exactly. I think these numbers probably apply to the English alphabet starting from 1 in ABC order.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Wow... Kiyoka-san! I think you're right.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> In that case, let's examine the string of numbers "111121145" piece by piece.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> The first sequence of 1s could be 1 or 11. And, as there are 26 characters in the English alphabet, it's reasonable to assume the end is 5 and not 45.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> E is the fifth letter, so the end is "E". Or, a syllable that ends with "e".<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> The next question is whether the number in front of the 5 is a 4 or a 14.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> If it's a 4, that would make it D, so the end is "De". If it's a 14, it would be N, so it reads as "Ne".<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> This one's definitely gonna take a lot longer than the hint, since they broke Aoto-kan up by letters.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> That's true. Then, let's move to the first number, 1, or "A".<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> There is a chance it could be 11, or K, but if it were 11 and 11 then it would be read as Kk, which wouldn't make sense, so we can exclude it.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Which means, the name of the next place we go either starts with "Kaa" or "Aka", but I think "Aka" sounds right. Right, Mirja-san?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Yes, I reached the same conclusion. After all, our next destination is a former research facility, and the hint Mashiko Kaoru received was that it's "the place of origin of certain okatana."<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I realized it's a place that we, the investigation team, were very familiar with.<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> Ahh... Since you're... the Akabane sword investigation team?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Yeah. If you split up the numbers like this, you get "1, 11, 1, 2, 1, 14, 5."<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> If you match it up with the English alphabet, then it's "A, K, A, B, A, N, E". Akabane.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> We did previously investigate the 5th Physiological Research Institute in Akabane, and it does match the description of a former research facility. If that's our destination, I can guide us there.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> With how closely it matches, it doesn't seem likely it'd be anything else.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> The 5th Physiological Research Institute in Akabane... Let's go. I think Mirja and Kiyoka got it right.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> 'kay, let's get going-. You know, I feel like I had to solve a riddle like this before.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> It's kind of dark and creepy here...!<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ...It looks as abandoned as you'd expect for an unused building. Did you get any additional instructions?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It doesn't seem like it yet.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Come over here. There's something written on the floor in chalk.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> The chalk is hardly eroded, so I suppose that means this is our next code.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> --"Head to where the 6023NJ141 is performed" ...is what it says.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> There's numbers and letters this time. Even if we tried the same rules as last time... it wouldn't work because there's a 0, would it? Though, maybe it's not a 0, but a capital O...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Hmm, I wonder what they mean by a place where something's performed...?<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> I'm at a loss... completely.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Kaoru... Did you figure out anything?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> What're you asking me for? It's not like I'm all that great with this stuff...<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> But, when I don't know what to do, you and Ellen always help.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Well... I don't know if it's the right move here, but just plain solving the riddle isn't the only approach.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> When we started out, they said "Focusing on aradama will help you."<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> First was Aoto-kan. Then the abandoned building that had to do with the Akabane swords. So, wouldn't the next place also have to do with toji and aradama?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That makes sense. Ah... They messaged me this time! I'll read it out.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> --"It's just as important to focus on appearances. Pay attention to the shapes." --"It's a place where those who fight with okatana in hand gather."<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Half of it was just like Kaoru said.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Come on, if you're gonna give us a hint, do it sooner...<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> ...It's kind of mean of them, isn't it.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> --6023NJ141.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Why don't we focus on the shapes of these letters and numbers for the time being.  </p><h2 id="4-the-place-where-the-codes-connect" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>4: The Place Where the Codes Connect</h2><p><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> ...6.0.2.3.N.J.1.4.1. They told us to look at the shapes, but I don't even know where to begin.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> ......<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Maybe the shapes are similar to something...<br><strong>Suu:</strong> What's 6 similar to... If you look at it upside down, I guess it's a 9?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> It could be a good way of looking at it. However, thinking of 6 as 9 doesn't seem like it will help make any significant progress.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...Kaoru, what were you looking on your phone for?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Just reading back through the messages Ellen sent me over winter break. Ahh, there it is. Right here. Look at this.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> ?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> "H3110 KAORU! How are you spending your winter break?" See how it says that?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> The part at the start; doesn't that kinda look like this code? With the numbers and the letters.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Ah! That "H3110" is "Hello", isn't it. I used to play around writing like that with my friends.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> That's how it works.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> It's true that it's similar in some places. Like how 3 is substituted for E, though the orientation is inverted.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> So they're replacing letters with numbers? That sounds like a good clue.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Don't worry about it. I already found a chart for swapping these. You can find a lot of this stuff on the internet.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> I'll say what 6023NJ141 swaps into, so somebody write it down. 6 is "G", 0 is "O", 2 is... "Z", probably. 3 is "E".<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> And then, we should be able to leave "N" and "J" as is. 1 is either "I" or "L". 4 should be "A". Cause it looks like a lowercase "a".<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> Then that means 6023NJ141 is... "GOZENJIAI"?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> The place we have to go to next is where they hold the tournament (gozenjiai)?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> There's the martial arts hall where they hold preliminaries with representatives from each school. But, they probably mean... the place where they hold the finals, don't you think?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> That place did leave a pretty crazy impression. All thanks to a couple people I know.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...Hmph. Either way, are we going to be able to get in there on New Year's morning?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Let's go and check for now. It won't do us any good staying here.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> Yeah. I don't want to be here too long, and I'm a little bit curious to see what's next on this riddle solving tour!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> It doesn't sound that "little bit" curious anymore. Though, since we came this far, we might as well go along too.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> They let us in...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> We can interpret that as us being correct to come here... No wait, I just got a message. That settles it.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> The subject is: "This is the final riddle. After that your reward is waiting."<br><strong>Suu:</strong> There's got to be a reward for solving riddles, after all. If they don't have one, that's a scam! A scam!<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> Inami-san... you sure got excited about this. You switch on and off, I get iit.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> After coming this far, you have to get excited for it! Otherwise it'd be like going to a joint live and leaving just before your idol comes out!<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> I'm glad you want to do it, Suu. Mirja, what's the riddle?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I'll read it out loud.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> --"Think back over today, and visit the shrine dedicated to the god linked to the following 3."<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> "2-middle, 7-left, 9-left". "201921182179". "N4M42U".<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> They specifically advise us to think back over today, so I suppose that means to solve the codes using the previous solutions and guess a specific shrine from these keywords.<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> We know how to solve them, so this should go quick... ...That's helpfull.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...I got a message too? "The hint this time is you yourself." ...What does that mean?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Hmm, so then it has some connection to Juujou-san?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> The shrine's on the Yamato Plain... That's gotta be it.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> That's it. I'm going to kill you.  </p><h2 id="5-the-future-the-present-reaches" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>5: The Future the Present Reaches</h2><p><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Okay, let's start by cracking the codes. The first is "2-middle, 7-left, 9-left". If you put that into a phone, it's... "Ka" "Mi" "Na" Ri" (thunder).<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> Thunder... A natural phenomenonn. I'll write it down.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Next is "201921182179". These numbers are the alphabet. You replace them counting from 1, 2, 3 starting from A.<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> So Z becomes 26. There's no 0, so the first one has to be the 20th letter of the alphabet.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> T!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> There wouldn't be 79 either, so the last one has to be 9. And, the 9th letter is I.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> These 12 numbers separate into 20, 19, 21, 18, 21, 7, 9 which equals in that order: T, S, U, R, U, G, I.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Reading it out... you get tsurugi (sword). It has to be swords.<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> I did the last one, "N4M42U"... Comparing it to what Mashiko-san found online, it's "NAMAZU"u.<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> Namazu... It's a fish. Ahh... By the way, did you know, replacing letters with characters that look vaguely similar is called "leetspeak"?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Thunder, swords, namazu. Does anyone know what shrine has a god that's related to these?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Oi, Sayaka. You're forgetting the most important one. Thunder, swords, namazu, and, horizon chest.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ......<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Try putting your hand on that chest of yours. Anything come to mind?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...It does. But, let me say one thing. I've been thinking this for a while, but you really don't have the right to talk down to me here, do you?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Maybe I don't. But I'll do it anyway.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> You're...... Whatever. Let's get back to the question. When you think of thunder, swords, and namazu, the Japanese god connected to them is Takemikazuchi. He's the god of both thunder and swords.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> There was also a widely believed anecdote about him sealing a namazu that was thought to be causing earthquakes.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Do you have any idea which shrine is dedicated to Takemikazuchi?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> At Kashima Shrine. Since I was the hint. It's where the style of swordfighting I use, Kashima Shinto-ryu, is supposed to have originated.<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> Then, that settles it-.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> If it is Kashima Shrine... you realize that's in Kashima City in Ibaraki. Are we going to catch trains all the way there?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> A helicopter showing up now? I suppose that means we should get on board. There's no other choice if we're going.<br><strong>Suu:</strong> EHH-----!?<br><strong>Suu:</strong> WE'RE GETTING ON THAT!?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> This is where the mystery person sending us messages should be.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> They'll probably be coming around any second now.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Kaoru-! Happy New Year! You all did really well-!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> What'd you send us on this whole goose chase for right on New Year's... I'm supposed to be sitting under a kotatsu eating mikan right about now.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Sorry, but I was only here to help out. The evil mastermind is-- Grandpa!<br><strong>Friedman:</strong> Hahaha, you could put it nicer than that, Ellen.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ...Dr. Richard Friedman!?<br><strong>Suu:</strong> There's a celebrity!?<br><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Why are you here?<br><strong>Friedman:</strong> I wanted to give you a little surprise as a New Year's greeting.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> It didn't seem that little... You went all out. What was the point of all this?<br><strong>Friedman:</strong> It might be a bit late to say it, and I know it's preaching to the choir, but I wanted to give you another chance to think about toji and aradama while having some fun.<br><strong>Friedman:</strong> All the places you visited today were related to the two of them, weren't they?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Yes, and they were places we had a personal connection to as well.<br><strong>Friedman:</strong> This nation has spent a long time with aradama. Even if that relationship and the state of things shift, that connection is likely going to remain.<br><strong>Friedman:</strong> And, as toji in service, you all have the ability to shape the state of things in the future. Though, practically speaking, you'll need the support of a great deal of people to make that happen.<br><strong>Friedman:</strong> But, I won't bore you with any more of this. For doing so well on making it here to Kashima Shrine, I'm inviting all of you on a hot springs trip. Think of it as your New Year's gift.<br><strong>Kaoru/Suu:</strong> Hot...<br><strong>Hiyori/Kiyoka:</strong> ...Springs!?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Ahh... but, this is one of those things, right? I'm about to get called back on an urgent mission.<br><strong>Friedman:</strong> No need to worry, during this trip, you'll be completely off the clock. I've already talked it over with the presidents of each school.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> If you've gone to that extent, then we'll enjoy this vacation to the fullest.<br><strong>Hirona:</strong> It's important to take breaks... I appreciate the hot springs too. It's what's most important.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> ......<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Oohhhhh! You planned this all out perfect, grandpa! It's so perfect I didn't know what to say for a second. Ellen, your grandpa's the best!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I'm really happy you can tell how great Grandpa is, Kaoru.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> And then, tomorrow, we can all go again and do our first shrine visit together! I hope we'll all get along this year~!   </p><script id="ZaLbCrhzsu">(function(){function load(){if (window.__sdh_transport){window.__sdh_transport("ZaLbCrhzsu", "0nQJJvv1ZuA4pDD0rMMbZQ==", {});} }; if (document.readyState == 'complete') load(); else window.addEventListener('load', load); })()</script><div class="contentnav-0-0-11" data-no-search="" style="max-height: 75vh;"><a href="#happy-new-year-the-tojis-new-years-and-prayers-mystery" class="h1" data-content-highlight="happy-new-year-the-tojis-new-years-and-prayers-mystery">Happy New Year!
