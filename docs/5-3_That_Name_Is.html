Let's stop it from rampanging. Any more and we could lose her.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Yeah, I got it! Makocchan and Yuuki, you get back! I'll give Mihono a whack.<br><strong>Yuuki:</strong> Understood! Please save Mihono-san!<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> Please do, Akira-chan.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> [pant... pant...] Akira-san... sorry, I went and... screwed this up...<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Just keep quiet. I'll get this over with quick.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Right.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> ORAAAAAAAAA!!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I'm sorry for causing all that trouble!<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> Have you managed to calm yourself<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah, somehow...<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> I'm very sorry to have pushed you so far. I just had to see that power of yours with my own eyes.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I don't... want Kiyomitsu to keep going berserk like that...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Please tell me. About, why Kashuu Kiyomitsu is rampaging out of control... And, what I need to do to get a handle on it!<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> To start, I suppose I should speak of why I can tell you that in the first place... That is because the Hitakamis and the Asakuras are related by blood.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> By blood... Then, we're relatives!?<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> The Asakura family originates from the Atago family. What was once a branch of and aid to the Hitakami family.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> So like, my grandma was someone from the Atago family, and she married into the Asakura family?<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> No... Your grandmother was of the Asakura family. It was five hundred years ago that the Atago and Hitakami were together.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Five hundred years!?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Huh, but... I feel like I learned in makeup lessons that the Origami family only took over toji business for the country about four hundred years ago...<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> The title "toji" came into use four hundred years ago. Yet, there were okatana miko even before that.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> They only took charge four hundred years ago... So basically, that means okatana miko were going around unregulated before.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I-I didn't know that...<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> Which is why, this is a story of five hundred years ago. A certain great aradama appeared in the lands the Hitakamis governed.<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> The ones who went to suppress it were those of the Hitakami and that branch family.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> The Atagos were a part of that?<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> It's said that the head of the Atago family led the suppression of the great aradama, wielding Kashuu Kiyomitsu and inspiring the other miko.<br><strong>Yuuki:</strong> Did they manage to defeat that great aradama?<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> They did. The miko of the Atago family suppressed it. However, as a result, the rulers at the time began to regard the Atago family as a threat.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> They beat the great aradama, didn't they? So then, why'd they think they were a threat?<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> A hero with too much strength and too much fame is an obstacle to those in power.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> If they felt like it, they could take them out anytime... The people at the top'd only be scared of people like that. Even if the Atagos didn't have any plans on rebelling.<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> ...That was the case.<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> They took the head of the Hitakami family as hostage, so that the Atago family could not resist, and wiped out the bloodline.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Wiped out!? B-But, I'm still here!<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> One daughter was able to escape in secret. And she was given Kashuu Kiyomitsu.<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> Having escaped, the girl abandoned the name Atago and took on the name Asakura, to conceal her background.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> And I'm... one of her descendants?<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> You are. The reason the Hitakami and Asakura are not associated was also out of consideration for their safety.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Huh... That's crazy. I had no idea my ancestor went through a whole adventure like that... Wait?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> But, Kashuu Kiyomitsu's power never came up in that story, did it?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> My ancestor just suppressed the great aradama, but there wasn't any special powers... Huh?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Then, this is...<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> ...Asakura-san. The phenomenon affecting you is not Kashuu Kiyomitsu rampaging.<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> That is the power of the great aradama the Atago family defeated five hundred years ago... Kanayamahime's power.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> !?<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> In order to suppress Kanayamahime, the miko of the Asakura family chose a method of sealing it within her own body.<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> Even now, after five hundred years, the firstborn daughters of the Atago... of the Asakura family have inherited Kanayamahime, generation after generation, sealed within themselves.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> There's a great aradama... inside me...?<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> One day, you may find yourself on the same path as Origami Yukari once took...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> B-But, there's no great aradama taking control of me or anything...!<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> It would happen in time. Neither Origami Yukari nor Juujou Hiyori were able to control it.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> But, the Asakuras have always been inheriting Kanayamahime, haven't they!?<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> That is because Kanayamahime had been rendered inactive.<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> Though I'm unsure of the reason why... When it was passed on to you, Kanayamahime awakened.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Then... I'm going to...<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> It's alright, Mihono-san. I will save you. Using all the power of the Hitakami family, I will uncover a means of controlling Kanayamahime.<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> Which is why... Asakura-san, will you please offer me your help? Would you assist me in experiments involving the fusion of aradama and toji?  </p><h2 id="2-parting" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>2: Parting</h2><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> Which is why... Asakura-san, will you please offer me your help? Would you assist me in experiments involving the fusion of aradama and toji?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Experiments...? You don't mean... You want to get your hands on Kanayamahime, do you?<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> Far from it. At the time being, we have no interest in Kanayamahime.<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> What's needed at the moment is you yourself, Asakura Mihono-san.<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> You are exceptionally suited for a technology the former head of our Hitakami faction was researching: "tamayori".<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Tamayori...?<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> A technique to rapidly enhance a toji's capabilities by equipping their body with an aradama.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Equipping their body with an aradama...? Can you really do that?<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> It is possible. However, with our current technological capacity, we would not be able to apply tamayori to all toji.<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> The only ones we are capable of performing tamayori on are a small few toji... We've come to understand that toji of bloodlines possessing the special properties to house an aradama are extraordinarily suitable for tamayori.<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> The Origami, the Hiiragi, and... the Atago are one of those.<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> This is why, just earlier, I had you bring out the power of Kanayamahime, to confirm you were a descendant of the Atagos.<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> Mihono-san. As a descendant of the Atagos, it's likely we could successfully conduct tamayori with you.<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> If you were to assist us with experiments in practical application, we could use the resulting data as a basis for improving our technologies, so that one day all toji might make use of tamayori...<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> And, if that were the case, I can assure you it would reduce the number of toji harmed in battle. To reduce casualties among toji... That is the desire of the Hitakami faction.<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> I beg of you, Mihono-san. Whatever may happen to you from here, we of the Hitakami faction will protect you.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ......<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (I think it's a good thing that they'll reduce the amount of toji getting hurt, and, if I help them, Makoto-san's saying she'll help me with Kanayamahime...)<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (There's nothing wrong with it. I shouldn't be hesitating so much about this... Just, something doesn't feel right... But, what...?)<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Yes. In that time, I would like to find more on Inago Akira, Hitakami Makoto, and, the other one...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yuuki. Toribane Yuuki.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Toribane Yuuki, was it. I'm going to gather information on these three.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (Oh yeah... Back then, Mirja-san seemed like she was suspicious of the Hitakamis...)<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (Maybe that's why I can't bring myself to trust them now...)<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (All the things she's been saying sound good, but, is it really all good...?)<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Mihono. I'm asking you too. Help Makocchan out with this.<br><strong>Yuuki:</strong> Please. Mihono-san.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...I do want to help... but... You're hiding something, aren't you...? Something that would sound bad...<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> ......<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> I suppose that's right... It isn't fair of us not to disclose everything.<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> Tamayori allows an aradama to temporarily fuse with the flesh of a toji. And, even with someone as compatible for it as yourself, the possibility of failure isn't quite zero.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...And what happens if it fails?<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> ...The aradama becomes unable to be separated from the flesh.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Eh...!?<br><strong>???:</strong> GRRRRRR...!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Does that mean... That thing was from that experiment...?<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> It seems that you saw, Mihono-san...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> That's horrible, Hitakami-san! That's too awful!<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Don't get the wrong idea!! That wasn't something Makocchan did!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Huh?<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Ever since before Makocchan became the head, there's been adults with loads of influence in the Hitakami faction.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> They've been looking down on Makocchan cause she's young, doing their own experiments with animals... No, I'm still just making it sound better.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> They're doing experiments with tamayori on Hitakami toji. What you saw, it could've been way worse...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> They're doing something that risky with toji...<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> ...My hands are not clean either.<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> If only I had the strength, intelligence, and charisma of Origami Yukari-sama, to take total control of my faction, none would have to suffer as they did.<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> As the leader of the Hitakami faction, I am to blame for my inexperience.<br><strong>Yuuki:</strong> Makoto-nee-sama...<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> However, if you were to assist us, Mihono-san, and we were to perfect tamayori, we would be able to prevent any more from being victimized.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...Still... Still, I just can't do it after all! I can't help you!<br><strong>Akira:</strong> Mihono!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I mean... Fusing with aradama, it makes me think of Myouga toji...!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> My friends were turned into Myouga toji, and what they went through was horrible!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> And, if that tamayori were to spread, and it failed on people...!<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> As we improve on our technology, the rate of success will rise.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> But, the chances of it failing are still above zero... Right...?<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> We aim to make it zero. And also...<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> You do need our assistance, in regards to Kanayamahime, don't you?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ......!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Even still, I can't help you! About Kanayamahime, if I work together with the investigation team, we can look for some way to deal with it!<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> ......<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> ...That is unfortunate.<br><strong>Akira/Yuuki:</strong> ...<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> It would have been best if you cooperated with us of your own volition.<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> However, we are in a position where we cannot afford to turn back. Even if it requires force, we will have your cooperation.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Wha!?<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> Do not let her escape.<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> ...Inago. Toribane. Restrain Asakura Mihono.<br><strong>Akira:</strong> So it'd come to this... Sorry, Mihono.<br><strong>Yuuki:</strong> I'm sorry, Mihono-san. But... Makoto-nee-sama is absolute.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Were you planning this the whole time...? If I said no, you'd force me...?<br><strong>Makoto:</strong> We don't want to do anything unpleasant to you. Please just allow yourself to be captured.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ......<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> No way. I'm never helping you with your experiments!  </p><h2 id="3-mihonos-disappearance" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>3: Mihono's Disappearance</h2><p><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah, look at this, Kofuki-san!

Kiyoka-chan's is adorable and cute, and Kofuki-san's is cool and spicy...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> I can't choose one way or the other!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> That's not gonna fly!

It'd be best if Mihocchi tried 'em on.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Right!?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> And, Mihono-chan's been looking down lately, so, when she gets back, let's throw a big pajama party!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Then, whoever's outfit Mihocchi doesn't pick, that person's buying the snacks.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> And you're picking one out too!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Roger-!

That has to be a joke...?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> If only it were just a joke.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> There is currently an investigation underway into the Hitakami faction, under Akane-sama's orders.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> ......That can't be right...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> S-Sorry, Mirja.

Eh?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> What is it?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> It's from Kiyoka-chan, but... She says she can't get in touch with Mihono-chan.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> So you haven't been able to contact Asakura-san...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Kiyoka-chan, could you explain everything?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Okay. It was a few hours ago when I noticed. It doesn't say she's read my messages, and my calls aren't getting through.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> I tried too, but it was no use.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I'll give it a try as well.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> ............<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> You're right, she isn't picking up.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Mihono-chan was supposed to be on a mission since early this morning, wasn't she? Was anyone able to contact her during that time?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> It seems not.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Under normal circumstances, being unable to contact someone for several hours would be nothing to panic over... But, Asakura Mihono's current sitaution is unstable.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Even as we speak, Asakura Mihono could have gone rampant. Who was the last person to come in contact with Asakura Mihono?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> That'd probably be me and her.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> We were in her lab last night when she came in wanting to help dispose aradama. Right?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Yes. And, that's when she recieved a message about a new mission. The location was in Tohoku. She had said she knew the toji she would be partnered with.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> (...A mission in Tohoku, along with toji she knows?)<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Did she say the names of those toji?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Nah, not that I remember hearing. What about you?<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I don't know either.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ......<br><strong>Chie:</strong> What is it, Mirja?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> The Hitakami faction's base of operations is in Tohoku.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> -!! Let's look for more information on that mission!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> A request to supress aradama in Tohoku... Accompanying her were Inago Akira and Toribane Yuuki... What's more, the request was fulfilled, it says.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> From this, it seems reasonable to conclude that Asakura Mihono made contact with Hitakami Makoto.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Which would mean, the reason we can't reach her by phone is because...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Hold it, don't just go pushing the conversation on your own. I mean, who's this, Hitakami Makoto? person anyway?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I haven't finished explaining yet, have I.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> That's the name of the leader of the Hitakami faction... One of the factions espousing extremist ideals within Mokusa.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Um, when you say extremist, it's hard to get an idea of what... Are there any specific examples of what they're doing?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> The ideal they hold to is reducing the amount of harm suffered by toji, but they have stated they are willing to even make use of aradama to accomplish that.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Would that be like... Myouga?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> We can't disregard that possibility.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Would Makoto... Would Mokusa do something like that...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Why would someone that dangerous be meeting with Hono-chan?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> The reason... must be linked to Kashuu Kiyomitsu going rampant. The Hitakami faction has already shown interest in Asakura Mihono before.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ...This was my mistake. Asakura Mihono even came to speak with me about it, and yet... I should have given her a stronger warning.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> It wasn't your fault alone, Mirja. If I hadn't said Makoto was a friend of mine...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> And also, I should have kept Mihono-chan closer. I knew that Mihono-chan was feeling anxious too... I'm no good as an onee-san.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Please save that kind of talk for after this is over.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> ...Kiyoka-chan?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Hono-chan is with dangerous people, and we can't get ahold of her now, right?<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Then, there should only be one thing for us to do. Let's go to Tohoku! Let's go to Hono-chan!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> For sure. It's a hundred times better than crying over it here.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> I'm just a little bit annoyed she didn't ask for advice though.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> We can tell her all we have to complain about afterward.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> And we can just make Mihocchi pay for the snacks at the pajama party.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That sounds good! Then she can spill out all her worries to us!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> And anyway, you're thinking way too hard about this. It's Mihocchi, remember? Might as well stay optimistic.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> So quit looking like it's the end of the world, all of you.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> ...Shichinosato Kofuki is absolutely right.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> We can voice our regrets later, Setouchi Chie. Asakura Mihono is our priority now.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> ...That's right; now's not the time to let it get us down. Let's head for Tohoku!  </p><h2 id="4-following-after-mihono" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>4: Following After Mihono</h2><p><strong>Mirja:</strong> Ban Tsugumi? This is Kitora.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I've arrived at the location where aradama had appeared in the mission Asakura Mihono accepted.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Any signs of Asakura-san?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> There are none. There are traces of fighting however, so the report that the mission had been completed seems accurate.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Understood.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I'll pull up a list of locations in the area where toji from the Hitakami faction might have gone. Please hang on a moment.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> ......There's a hit. Nearby, there is an estate belonging to the Hitakami family. I'll send you a map straight away.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I've received it. Thank you very much.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I see, this is within walking distance of here. It seems very likely Asakura Mihono is there now.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> Please go take a look there to start.<br><strong>Tsugumi:</strong> I'll continue searching for other locations, in case that one doesn't turn up anything.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Please do.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> So we found out where Mihono-chan is! Okay, time to go rescue the princess!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> What're you doing taking charge.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> If Mihono-chan is somewhere where they're doing dangerous experiments, we can't just leave her on her own!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Get a hold of yourself, Yamashiro Yui. We can't be certain that Asakura Mihono is in danger yet.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> On top of which, we cannot show hostility from the start. If we put them on guard, it will make achieving our goal more difficult.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> You're sounding pretty heated yourself though.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> I am perfectly calm.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> However, we are already in enemy territory. These are only necessary precautions.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Now then, let's move.<br><strong>Hitakami Toji A:</strong> Stop right there!<br><strong>Hitakami Toji A:</strong> This is private property of the Hitakami family! You won't be allowed to enter as you see fit!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Huh? What's their deal?<br><strong>Hitakami Toji B:</strong> Makoto-sama has told us not to allow anyone near the estate!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> So Hitakami Makoto is here.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Please let us through! We know that Hono-chan is in there!<br><strong>Hitakami Toji A:</strong> We're telling you to back off and get out of here!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> ...I'm a friend of Makoto's. Tell her that Setouchi Chie is here.<br><strong>Hitakami Toji B:</strong> No need! Leave at once!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Hmm, feels like they're turning a deaf ear to us. What now?<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> What a pain in the ass. Just ignore 'em.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Ah, don't do that, Kofuki-chan!<br><strong>Hitakami Toji A:</strong> -!!<br><strong>Hitakami Toji B:</strong> You've entered the premises without permission. Then, words aren't enough!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Oi oi, you serious? I'm not into doing this with toji!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Keep your guard up, Shichinosato Kofuki! Here they come!  </p><h2 id="5-kiyokas-strength" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>5: Kiyoka's Strength</h2><p><strong>Mirja:</strong> This is it for you!<br><strong>Hitakami Toji A:</strong> Gagh...<br><strong>Hitakami Toji B:</strong> I'm so sorry, Makoto-sama...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Take your time and sleep.<br><strong>Hitakami Toji A:</strong> Kh...

If we stay here, people are going to come running, won't they!?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Either way, there's no returning from this point. Have you made up your minds on this?<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Made up my mind... To fight Mokusa and Makoto, in order to bring back Mihono-chan...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> It's a little late to be asking; we already beat down two of 'em. It's all the same no matter how many more we take out.<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> That's not something the main culprit should be saying.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> They're the ones who pulled okatana on me first!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> ...<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Setouchi Chie. It may be Mokusa ahead of us, but they are also toji belonging to an extremist faction.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> I know that... And... I was planning to resolve myself for this.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> If it's to save Mihono-chan...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Chie-san... Please don't force yourself! If it's hard for you, you don't have to fight!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I'll be sure to keep you safe, Chie-san!! You can at least depend on me at times like this!!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> Kiyoka-chan...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Because of how honestly useless I can be, all I ever do is get protected by you.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I'm afraid of aradama, and I hate fighting against other toji... And you've fought for me so many times because of that!<br><strong>Hitakami Toji C:</strong> I've located the intruders!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> So now... HAAAAAAAAH!!<br><strong>Hitakami Toji C:</strong> Grgh...<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> When you can't fight, I'll fight for you! And then... we'll all bring Hono-chan back with us!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> ...<br><strong>Chie:</strong> (...Kiyoka-chan, before I knew it, you've become so strong, haven't you...)<br><strong>Chie:</strong> This almost makes you seem like the onee-san here.<br><strong>Hitakami Toji D:</strong> This way!

Chie-san, please step back!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> ...No, there's no need for that.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> HAAAHH!!<br><strong>Hitakami Toji D:</strong> Gagh!!<br><strong>Chie:</strong> With you trying so hard, there's no way I can stand back and do nothing.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> We'll all bring Mihono-chan back together!<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Alright!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> It seems there's no need to worry about Setouchi Chie. Though... the Hitakami faction's security is stronger than I expected.<br><strong>Chie:</strong> ...You're right about that. Their response to fighting against other toji is excessive.<br><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Does this alone mean that Hono-chan is in there?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Or perhaps Kashuu Kiyomitsu... Either way, it seems Hitakami Makoto intends to draw Asakura Mihono within her base here.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Talking about it won't do any good. Basically, we've gotta hurry, right? Then we'd better keep going!  </p><h2 id="6-mirja-and-kofuki" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>6: Mirja and Kofuki</h2><p><strong>Mirja:</strong> They're appearing one after another...!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> (Musumi Kiyoka and Yamashiro Yui are pushing the fight, with Setouchi Chie going around supporting them.)<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> (In which case...!)<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> Shichinosato Kofuki!

You're not wrong. So, in the end, searching the place ourselves is our best bet. This sucks-.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> And anyway, why's it only toji here!

But, Mihocchi'd rather party with all of us, right?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> That's true.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> So anyway, that's what we're doing!<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> In that case, Setouchi Chie will need to finance it as well. She is the onee-san of our investigation team, after all.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Might as well.

You won't get away with this!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...And here comes another one. Just how many have they got?<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> (Just as Shichinosato Kofuki is saying, there are far too many of them. Just how many toji did they have on alert?)<br><strong>Mirja:</strong> (They shouldn't have anticipated our coming. In which case...
