Is there any need for a unit like this...<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Currently, there is a mixed unit from all the Five Traditions on a mission to investigate the Akabane swords. If all goes well, the number of okatana in our possession should steadily rise from here.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> In which case, we may find that there aren&#x27;t enough toji to pair with these okatana.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> In order to protect the people, the more toji we have, the better. If we use this unit wisely, there&#x27;s a chance it will increase the number of toji applicants.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Still...<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Do you disapprove? Maki.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> No. If you make the order, Yukari-sama, I will use all the power given to the elite guard to fulfill it. I have no complaints.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Good. Then, begin at once.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Understood. I will prepare a unit capable of accomplishing this mission. The Special Ritual Riot Squad Distinguished Publicity Unit--<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Hereby known as, the Toji Cheer Squad!!<br>
<strong>Takatsu Yukina:</strong> Just now, Yukari-sama sent an order down to each of the Five Traditions. A toji from each school will undergo a selection exam to take part in a unit undergoing a special mission.<br>
<strong>Yukina:</strong> Sayaka, you are my masterpiece. This is a chance to prove the vast difference between you and these other toji.<br>
<strong>Yukina:</strong> Pass their selection, and be acknowledged by Yukari-sama.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> I will. This special mission... What is it about?<br>
<strong>Yukina:</strong> Cheerleading.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ............Cheer leading?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Has everyone arrived?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Yes! Everyone&#x27;s here!<br>
<strong>Naruse Miki:</strong> Though everyone is just the five of us, isn&#x27;t it~?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I&#x27;m here, I&#x27;m here! When I heard they wanted someone for such a delicious event, I threw both my hands up!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Ah, you&#x27;re here too, Sayaka-chan?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm. President Takatsu ordered me to be here.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Osafune&#x27;s Kohagura Ellen, Heijou&#x27;s Naruse Miki, Ayanokouji&#x27;s Yamashiro Yui, Minoseki&#x27;s Yanase Mai, Renpu&#x27;s Itomi Sayaka--<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> So you five are each school&#x27;s nominees.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Makimaki? What are the five of us going to be doing here? We came all the way to this inn out in the mountains.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> You should have heard; all of you are applicants nominated to join the Toji Cheer Squad.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> In order to advertise the position of toji, this squad will improve our image.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> As this is a direct proposal from Yukari-sama, I won&#x27;t accept any half-hearted effort. You&#x27;ll acquire the skills necessary to put on the perfect cheerleading performance.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> To make that happen, you&#x27;ll now be participating in a special cheerleading training camp!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Camp! So I&#x27;ll be camping under the same roof with all these cuties...!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ahh, I-I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll be able to control myself! I&#x27;ll apologize in advance! If anything happens, sorry!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> If anything happens... Like what, exactly?<br>
<strong>Miki:</strong> I think it&#x27;s best not to pry into that. At least, that&#x27;s what my intuition&#x27;s telling me.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Hm... Well, fine.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> One week from now, Yukari-sama herself will be coming to inspect your performances.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> If she approves of you, only then will you be officially accepted into the Toji Cheer Squad.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> This sounds like fun. If we&#x27;re going to do it, we might as well give it our best shot!<br>
<strong>Miki:</strong> Though, cheerleading doesn&#x27;t exactly sound like a toji&#x27;s work, does it...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Naruse Miki. This was a direct order from Yukari-sama herself. I won&#x27;t allow you to take it lightly.<br>
<strong>Miki:</strong> I-I understand that~. So please stop glaring at me..<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...I&#x27;ll do my best.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Good. Starting now, all of you should aim to become the ultimate cheerleaders!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="2-cheerleaders-in-training"></a>2: Cheerleaders, in Training!<a class="hash-link" href="#2-cheerleaders-in-training" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Maki:</strong> We&#x27;ll start with your stamina! Run for one hour through the mountains. Afterwards, we&#x27;ll do squats, sit ups, and push ups.<br>
<strong>Miki:</strong> Pant~ pant~... Why... Are we doing something so sporty...?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Cheerleading works as a sort of endurance match too!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> I&#x27;ll do my best.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Next you&#x27;ll be learning the fundamental techniques. Beginning with stunts, and then forming a pyramid!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Stunts...?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Stunts are a part of the act as a cheerleader. A pyramid is made up of a combination of stunts. Now, let&#x27;s get started!<br>
<strong>Miki:</strong> Th-This got hard all of a sudden...<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> I&#x27;ll do my best.<br>
And so their practicing continued... After several days passed...</p><p><strong>Maki:</strong> Jump, step, watch those feet! Focus!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Good, stop. You all seem like you&#x27;re getting used to this.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> I could do this much before breakfast!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Though-- Itomi Sayaka. Your movements are perfect, but there&#x27;s still a stiffness that you can&#x27;t get rid of.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Stiffness...?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> According to my cheerleading textbook, showing emotion through your expression is essential... You need to work on that from now on.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Who wants to get in the bath with me!? The bath! We should all take a bath, you know! Have to take one right away!<br>
<strong>Miki:</strong> Why are you still so worked up...?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> What&#x27;s wrong, Sayaka-chan? You look down.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Shidou Maki told me before... I can&#x27;t get rid of my stiffness.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> I thought I was doing everything right. But, I&#x27;m missing something... I don&#x27;t know what to do.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> We all only just started cheerleading. I don&#x27;t think you should worry about it so much.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> But President Takatsu said I have to get Origami Yukari&#x27;s acknowledgement and become a cheer toji. I have to do my best...<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Sayaka-chan...<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I know! In that case, why not get some pointers from someone more skilled? You might learn something useful.<br>
The next day--</p><p><strong>Sayaka:</strong> Shidou Maki. Please teach me some pointers.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Sayaka-chan is worried... She wants to hear some advice from you.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ...Sorry. I don&#x27;t know anything about cheerleading myself, so I can&#x27;t teach you anything that&#x27;s not in the textbook...<br>
<strong>Miki:</strong> Eh-! Is that true!?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> That won&#x27;t do~. If you want to teach someone, you have to be able to do it yourself!<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Ahh, seeing Shidou-san dancing around cheerleading... I&#x27;d pay to see that! In fact, I need to see it, pant, pant...!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> No, I&#x27;m not going to be one of the cheer toji; I&#x27;m just your coach and judge... There&#x27;s no need for a coach to master the sport.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Makimaki, there&#x27;s a phone call for you.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ...For some reason... I have a strong feeling that I shouldn&#x27;t answer this...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Hello, Maki-san?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Yes. What&#x27;s going on, Suzuka.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yukari-sama asked me to pass along a message to you just now.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> &quot;I forgot to mention this, but you&#x27;re also assigned to participate as a member of the cheer toji.&quot; ...Is the message she left me.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> What... Did you say...!?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Hooray-! Now Shidou-san has no choice but to be a cheerleader with us!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Kh...!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...Shidou Maki wasn&#x27;t a cheerleading expert... Who else knows how...?<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> What about Naruse-san and Yamashiro-san?<br>
<strong>Miki:</strong> Eh, you want me to teach you? I&#x27;m hardly any better.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> I&#x27;ve been too busy watching the other girls cheering with all they&#x27;ve got, so I&#x27;m not that confident in my own skills.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Then that leaves... Ellen-chan?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Hm? You need me?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Yeah, yeah, yeah! Finish!<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Wow, Ellen-chan, your cheering is so good!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Fu fu fu! America is the home of cheerleading, after all! Of course I&#x27;m good at it!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the reason though... But Ellen is the best.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Ellen, teach me the techniques for cheerleading.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> And I&#x27;ll practice with you. If that&#x27;s alright with you, Ellen-chan.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> It&#x27;s okay! Just leave it to me!  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="3-final-exam"></a>3: Final Exam<a class="hash-link" href="#3-final-exam" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>And so, after several days--</p><p><strong>Ellen:</strong> Right, left, right, left, do a spin, and jump!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...I did it.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> I think I did it right too.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Excellent! You two are in perfect sync.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> And you, Saaya, your stiffness from before is gone! Very good!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Thank you. It&#x27;s because you taught me.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Non non, Saaya. I didn&#x27;t do anything.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> But you&#x27;re the one who taught me how to get better.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> You&#x27;ve always been so physically fit, Saaya, so your cheerleading techniques were already perfect.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> But your expression was too stiff. You looked like a beautiful doll, being puppeteered around...<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> I did...?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> But when you were with Maimai, you were making such a happy face. So Maimai is actually the reason you&#x27;re doing better!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> If you want to thank anyone, you should be thanking her.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> I see... Mai, thank you.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Eh!? I-I didn&#x27;t do anything though.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Ahaha, looks like Maimai&#x27;s the perfect medicine for Saaya after all!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> When you two were cheering just now, you were so coordinated you looked like sisters!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> If Mai were my sister... That wouldn&#x27;t be bad.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> S-Sayaka-chan!?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Today marks the end of the training camp. Finally, Yukari-sama herself will be judging all of you. If she approves, you will be officially admitted into the Toji Cheer Squad.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> This is an official mission you have been assigned as toji. Show me your fullest potential, the same as you would if you were suppressing aradama.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Are you going to be cheering too, Makimaki?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I&#x27;ve been practicing every waking moment since then... As a member of the elite guard, failure here isn&#x27;t an option.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Now then, one by one, show me your performances as a cheerleader.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Good, Naruse Miki. You pass.<br>
<strong>Miki:</strong> Thank you very much.<br>
<strong>Miki:</strong> Phew~, thank goodness~. If you want to stand out, you can&#x27;t wait for others to go ahead of you.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Yamashiro Yui, pass.<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Yes, I did it! I had to make it into this unit to be around those cute cheerleaders, after all!<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Kohagura Ellen, pass.<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Of course!<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Shidou Maki, pass. That was a good performance.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Thank you very much.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> ...If only I&#x27;d brought Suzuka here to see this.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> P-Please don&#x27;t joke like that, Yukari-sama!<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Yanase Mai, pass.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Phew... Thank you very much.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Lastly... Itomi Sayaka.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Yes.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> (Her expression is stiff. This type of role might not be suited for Itomi Sayaka...)<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Sayaka-chan, relax your shoulders. I&#x27;ll be here with you.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mai... Mm, okay.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> (...Hm. She was able to relax herself when she needed to.)<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> --Finish.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Good. Itomi Sayaka, you pass.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Good...<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> You did it, Sayaka-chan!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm. Thank you, Mai.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> All of you passed. You&#x27;ve done well, putting on these performances after such a short period of time.<br>
<strong>Yukari:</strong> Now then... In the coming days, you&#x27;ll have your final practical test.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="4-formation-of-the-toji-cheer-squad"></a>4: Formation of the Toji Cheer Squad<a class="hash-link" href="#4-formation-of-the-toji-cheer-squad" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Ellen:</strong> So our final test is putting us in actual combat!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Recently, there&#x27;s been a number of reports of aradama appearing around this stadium.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> If aradama appear while a game is taking place, a significant number of people in the stadium could be in danger.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> If aradama do appear, we need to defeat them right away...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> That&#x27;s how it is. For that reason, the Toji Cheer Squad will be standing by here in the stadium.<br>
<strong>Miki:</strong> On top of that, even though we&#x27;re meant to be cheer toji, we&#x27;re still wearing our ordinary uniforms, aren&#x27;t we?<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Sighhh~... What a letdown... I was so looking forward to everyone dressing up like cheerleaders.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> Ahaha... Still, I&#x27;m sort of relieved. It would be a little embarrassing fighting wearing something like that...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> That&#x27;s for sure...<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> --! The spectrum finder is detecting something...!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Looks like the aradama are already here. Let&#x27;s go!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Stop right there!<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> Oh, Hanahana, are you our backup?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I&#x27;m only here to deliver these clothes. The finishing touches took longer than expected, but here you are: the official uniforms of the Special Ritual Riot Squad Distinguished Publicity Unit.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> What... Are these...!?<br>
<strong>Ellen:</strong> WOW! Real cheerleader uniforms!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> Mm...<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> This is what cheerleaders have to wear, is it...<br>
<strong>Yui:</strong> Yessssss!! Cheerleader uniforms for everyone! I can&#x27;t believe my eyes!<br>
<strong>Miki:</strong> Don&#x27;t get too excited...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> You&#x27;ll carry out your mission while wearing these, everyone.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> And Yukari-sama has asked me to remind you to do your cheerleading performance after you&#x27;re done fighting.<br>
Several days later--</p><p><strong>Kanami:</strong> Check it out, Mai-chan, Sayaka-chan! They put up a video of the cheer toji on the internet!<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> It&#x27;s true.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> So they recorded it after all... When we were fighting wearing that.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> The number of views... Is a lot. It&#x27;s over one million.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> They said cheerleading would improve our image and make others want to join... But is this really going to make more girls want to be toji...?<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> I&#x27;m sure it will! I mean, see how cute you all look!<br>
<strong>Kanami:</strong> Oh, see, this is the part where you and Sayaka-chan started cheering after beating that aradama.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> ...Mm, I get it.<br>
<strong>Mai:</strong> ? What do you mean, Sayaka-chan?<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> I... Had more fun than I thought.<br>
<strong>Sayaka:</strong> (I&#x27;m glad I was able to do what President Takatsu asked me to... But, doing it with my friends... Was a little fun too.)</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations/edit/docs/Assemble_Toji_Cheer_Squad.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_2_ui" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_3DPF"></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"></div></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_35-E thin-scrollbar"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#1-special-mission-announcement" class="table-of-contents__link">1: Special Mission Announcement</a></li><li><a href="#2-cheerleaders-in-training" class="table-of-contents__link">2: Cheerleaders, in Training!</a></li><li><a href="#3-final-exam" class="table-of-contents__link">3: Final Exam</a></li><li><a href="#4-formation-of-the-toji-cheer-squad" class="table-of-contents__link">4: Formation of the Toji Cheer Squad</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Links</div><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://pastebin.com/LdyviZ8Z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Translator anon&#x27;s pastebin<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Site source code<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Built with Docusaurus.</div></div></div></footer></div>
