## 1: Riddles in Place of Osechi
**Mirja:** Good work on our mission, everyone. We successfully cleared out the aradama without incident.  
**Kaoru:** They went and dragged us into a mission on New Year's morning. Couldn't they give us a special bonus and call it our New Year's money?  
**Hirona:** ...  
**Hirona:** ...Having seven people is inefficient. Couldn't some of us have been absent or on standby?  
**Kaoru:** You tell 'em-.  
**Mirja:** Hm? This is...  
**Kiyoka:** What is it? Did you get some urgent assignment?  
**Mirja:** No, you don't need to worry about that. I only received a strange message.  
**Mirja:** It caught my attention because the subject is: "Focusing on aradama will help you."  
**Sayaka:** What does it say?  
**Suu:** It sounds like spam... Maybe you should just delete it without checking. Ah, I mean... Not that I'm trying to argue with you or anything, Itomi-sama?  
**Mirja:** It has no images or URL; only text.  
**Mirja:** "If you'd like to know more, first head to '1-middle, 1-down, 4-down, 2-middle, 0-up'. Then, take a picture of the location. Attach it in a response to this message."  
**Mirja:** --That's all it says.  
**Hiyori:** That's it? It sounded like some kind of code.  
**Kiyoka:** ...There used to be a lot of ghost stories that started with texts like this, weren't there? You think it doesn't have anything to do with you, but then... It goes like that.  
**Mirja:** ...I think it's only a prank, but, with the reference to aradama, I can't overlook it.  
**Suu:** Well I'm not interested in any aradama, so I just want to go straight home-!  
**Kaoru:** Same. I don't want stick my neck into trouble right after getting out of a mission. I can already tell this won't be worth it.  
**Suu:** See, exactly! Let's go back home!  
**Sayaka:** ...?  
**Sayaka:** I just got a message on my phone... Is this a hint?  
**Sayaka:** "It's a store very popular among certain young girls (they say) What you hold in your hand now is the 'key'." --That's what it says.  
**Hirona:** They're specifically sending messages to us thenn...  
**Hiyori:** It's suspicious...   
**Mirja:** We can't disregard whoever's sending these at this point. Itomi Sayaka, could you show me that hint once more?  
**Sayaka:** Here.  
**Mirja:** Thank you.  
**Mirja:** ...A store very popular among certain young girls. I don't know what the "they say" part refers to, but is "1-middle, 1-down, 2-middle, 0-down" the name of the store?  
**Kiyoka:** The other hint: "What you hold in your hand now is the 'key'", does it mean phones?  
**Kaoru:** You guys... Aren't you a little too fast in switching gears to whatever weird stuff comes up?  
**Hirona:** ......Let's just give in and solve this riddle. I'm sure that'll be the most efficient outcome.  
**Suu:** ...But, I wanted to go home-!  
**Sayaka:** We can go home after we find who sent these messages, so you try your best too, Suu.  

## 2: The Hint is Always Right Beside You
**Hiyori:** "1-middle, 1-down, 4-down, 2-middle, 0-up"... So, it's numbers, and... What's the up, down, and middle part about? Some kind of location, or direction?  
**Mirja:** I wonder what rules it's following. They gave a hint that it has to do with our phones, but... Hmm.  
**Suu:** Aghh, I keep sending Hokuto-san Happy New Year's texts, but she isn't responding to any-!  
**Hirona:** ...That's amazing, Inami-san.  
**Hirona:** You're writing those texts unbelievably fast.  
**Suu:** Eh, am I really that fast?  
**Hiyori:** ...How are you going that fast pressing the screen so few times?  
**Hirona:** ......She's using flick inputs. Inami-san, please demonstrate.  
**Suu:** Just watch me!  
**Suu:** With flick inputs, if you want "A", tap A. If you want "Ke", tap Ka and flick it to the right, see? For "O", go down... like that!  
**Hirona:** [clap clap clap]~...  
**Hiyori:** So, if you tap and keep it right in the middle, you get A sounds. Left gets you I sounds. Up gets U sounds... Right gets E sounds. Down gets O sounds... And you can write like that...?  
**Suu:** You'll mess up at first, but once you get used to it, it's a lot faster.  
**Hirona:** ...  
**Hirona:** Excuuse... me. I figured out that code... I think.  
**Mirja:** Did you, Nitta Hirona? Please explain.  
**Hirona:** Okaay.  
**Hirona:** The numbers in here apply to each line of the Japanese alphabet. 1 is the A column, 2 is the Ka column, 3 is the Sa column, 5 is the Ta column... and so on.  
**Hirona:** "1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0." "A, Ka, Sa, Ta, Na, Ha, Ma, Ya, Ra, Wa." --If you write it out easier to understand, it's like this.  
**Hirona:** And, the middle and down part is, when you use flick input, the direction you flick it.  
**Hirona:** So the directions point to each column of the Japanese alphabet, or which vowel to use in each line...  
**Kiyoka:** Oh! You change the input, but you tap the A column and number at the same place!  
**Kaoru:** When you put it like that, it makes sense.  
**Suu:** So... 1-middle is "A". 1-down is "O". 4-down is "To". 2-middle is "Ka". And last is 0-up, "N". Is that it?  
**Sayaka:** Aoto... kan.  
**Mirja:** It's Aoto-kan? It's true that it's popular among certain young girls... Toji like ourselves. And, if the input method on our phones is the key they mentioned, there's no questioning it.  
**Hiyori:** That place isn't far from here. Guess we should run over there.  
**Kaoru:** Hiyori... I'm surprised to see her getting so into this. Does she actually like this kinda thing?  
**Kiyoka:** If you invite Juujou-san along, she'll come up with some reason to join in.  
**Kaoru:** Well, as long as she's having fun.  
**Hiyori:** It's closed. Probably should have expected that, since it's New Year's Day.  
**Mirja:** For now, let's send a photo of Aoto-kan's exterior as we were instructed.  
**Mirja:** ...I'm surprised to get a response almost immediately after sending it, but, is this another code?  
**Mirja:** --"Head to 111121145's former research facility."  
**Sayaka:** ...The place where the research facility is became numbers?  
**Kaoru:** They're not making it easy on us, but it sounds like it from how they wrote it. Did you get another hint, Sayaka?  
**Sayaka:** I didn't get one.  
**Suu:** Making us do this without a hint is a huge difficulty spike out of nowhere, isn't it-?  
**Kiyoka:** Ah, take a look at this. The paper on the door to Aoto-kan...!  
**Hiyori:** "Greetings, Happy New Year" ...and afterwards is...  
**Hiyori:** "1, 15, 20, 15, 11, 1, 14. owner, Aoto Youji."  
**Mirja:** This is likely the same as the previous code.  
**Kiyoka:** Do you think this is a hint, maybe? Like... these numbers represent Aoto-kan, or something.  
**Suu:** But, isn't the amount of numbers different...?   
**Mirja:** The first question was in hiragana, but this one might be in some other alphabet.  
**Mirja:** Then, if these numbers do represent Aoto-kan as Musumi Kiyoka suggests, the "1" at the start is very likely "A".  
**Sayaka:** ...This is hard.  
**Kaoru:** You're supposed to spend New Year's under a kotatsu with mikan. It's basically the law... But this is probably gonna keep us stuck here for a while.  
**Kaoru:** Nn... Wait, it's my phone this time. What now... "The place of origin of certain okatana." What's that about?  

## 3: Is Cracking Codes Business as Usual for Toji?
**Suu:** "Head to 111121145's former research facility"...  
**Suu:** It says that, but, this code... Does it make any sense at all? I'm hitting max hopelessness here; I can't think of anything anymoreee.  
**Kaoru:** Don't force it, just take it easy-. I feel like passing on this one too.  
**Kiyoka:** Ah--! The amount of numbers here, this has to be it when you write it with the English alphabet...!  
**Kiyoka:** A, O, T, O, K, A, N. With seven of them, you get Aoto-kan.  
**Hiyori:** So A is 1, then O is 15, T is 20, K is 11, and N is 14?  
**Kiyoka:** Exactly. I think these numbers probably apply to the English alphabet starting from 1 in ABC order.  
**Suu:** Wow... Kiyoka-san! I think you're right.  
**Mirja:** In that case, let's examine the string of numbers "111121145" piece by piece.  
**Mirja:** The first sequence of 1s could be 1 or 11. And, as there are 26 characters in the English alphabet, it's reasonable to assume the end is 5 and not 45.  
**Sayaka:** E is the fifth letter, so the end is "E". Or, a syllable that ends with "e".  
**Mirja:** The next question is whether the number in front of the 5 is a 4 or a 14.  
**Mirja:** If it's a 4, that would make it D, so the end is "De". If it's a 14, it would be N, so it reads as "Ne".  
**Kaoru:** This one's definitely gonna take a lot longer than the hint, since they broke Aoto-kan up by letters.  
**Mirja:** That's true. Then, let's move to the first number, 1, or "A".  
**Mirja:** There is a chance it could be 11, or K, but if it were 11 and 11 then it would be read as Kk, which wouldn't make sense, so we can exclude it.  
**Kiyoka:** Which means, the name of the next place we go either starts with "Kaa" or "Aka", but I think "Aka" sounds right. Right, Mirja-san?  
**Mirja:** Yes, I reached the same conclusion. After all, our next destination is a former research facility, and the hint Mashiko Kaoru received was that it's "the place of origin of certain okatana."  
**Mirja:** I realized it's a place that we, the investigation team, were very familiar with.  
**Hirona:** Ahh... Since you're... the Akabane sword investigation team?  
**Kiyoka:** Yeah. If you split up the numbers like this, you get "1, 11, 1, 2, 1, 14, 5."  
**Kiyoka:** If you match it up with the English alphabet, then it's "A, K, A, B, A, N, E". Akabane.  
**Mirja:** We did previously investigate the 5th Physiological Research Institute in Akabane, and it does match the description of a former research facility. If that's our destination, I can guide us there.  
**Hiyori:** With how closely it matches, it doesn't seem likely it'd be anything else.  
**Sayaka:** The 5th Physiological Research Institute in Akabane... Let's go. I think Mirja and Kiyoka got it right.  
**Kaoru:** 'kay, let's get going-. You know, I feel like I had to solve a riddle like this before.  
**Suu:** It's kind of dark and creepy here...!  
**Hirona:** ...It looks as abandoned as you'd expect for an unused building. Did you get any additional instructions?  
**Kiyoka:** It doesn't seem like it yet.  
**Sayaka:** Come over here. There's something written on the floor in chalk.  
**Mirja:** The chalk is hardly eroded, so I suppose that means this is our next code.  
**Mirja:** --"Head to where the 6023NJ141 is performed" ...is what it says.  
**Hiyori:** There's numbers and letters this time. Even if we tried the same rules as last time... it wouldn't work because there's a 0, would it? Though, maybe it's not a 0, but a capital O...  
**Kiyoka:** Hmm, I wonder what they mean by a place where something's performed...?  
**Hirona:** I'm at a loss... completely.  
**Sayaka:** Kaoru... Did you figure out anything?  
**Kaoru:** What're you asking me for? It's not like I'm all that great with this stuff...  
**Sayaka:** But, when I don't know what to do, you and Ellen always help.  
**Kaoru:** Well... I don't know if it's the right move here, but just plain solving the riddle isn't the only approach.  
**Kaoru:** When we started out, they said "Focusing on aradama will help you."  
**Kaoru:** First was Aoto-kan. Then the abandoned building that had to do with the Akabane swords. So, wouldn't the next place also have to do with toji and aradama?  
**Kiyoka:** That makes sense. Ah... They messaged me this time! I'll read it out.  
**Kiyoka:** --"It's just as important to focus on appearances. Pay attention to the shapes." --"It's a place where those who fight with okatana in hand gather."  
**Sayaka:** Half of it was just like Kaoru said.  
**Kaoru:** Come on, if you're gonna give us a hint, do it sooner...  
**Hirona:** ...It's kind of mean of them, isn't it.  
**Mirja:** --6023NJ141.  
**Mirja:** Why don't we focus on the shapes of these letters and numbers for the time being.  

## 4: The Place Where the Codes Connect
**Kiyoka:** ...6.0.2.3.N.J.1.4.1. They told us to look at the shapes, but I don't even know where to begin.  
**Kaoru:** ......  
**Hiyori:** Maybe the shapes are similar to something...  
**Suu:** What's 6 similar to... If you look at it upside down, I guess it's a 9?  
**Mirja:** It could be a good way of looking at it. However, thinking of 6 as 9 doesn't seem like it will help make any significant progress.  
**Sayaka:** ...Kaoru, what were you looking on your phone for?  
**Kaoru:** Just reading back through the messages Ellen sent me over winter break. Ahh, there it is. Right here. Look at this.  
**Sayaka:** ?  
**Kaoru:** "H3110 KAORU! How are you spending your winter break?" See how it says that?  
**Kaoru:** The part at the start; doesn't that kinda look like this code? With the numbers and the letters.  
**Suu:** Ah! That "H3110" is "Hello", isn't it. I used to play around writing like that with my friends.  
**Kaoru:** That's how it works.  
**Mirja:** It's true that it's similar in some places. Like how 3 is substituted for E, though the orientation is inverted.  
**Hiyori:** So they're replacing letters with numbers? That sounds like a good clue.  
**Kaoru:** Don't worry about it. I already found a chart for swapping these. You can find a lot of this stuff on the internet.  
**Kaoru:** I'll say what 6023NJ141 swaps into, so somebody write it down. 6 is "G", 0 is "O", 2 is... "Z", probably. 3 is "E".  
**Kaoru:** And then, we should be able to leave "N" and "J" as is. 1 is either "I" or "L". 4 should be "A". Cause it looks like a lowercase "a".  
**Hirona:** Then that means 6023NJ141 is... "GOZENJIAI"?  
**Sayaka:** The place we have to go to next is where they hold the tournament (gozenjiai)?  
**Hiyori:** There's the martial arts hall where they hold preliminaries with representatives from each school. But, they probably mean... the place where they hold the finals, don't you think?  
**Kaoru:** That place did leave a pretty crazy impression. All thanks to a couple people I know.  
**Hiyori:** ...Hmph. Either way, are we going to be able to get in there on New Year's morning?  
**Mirja:** Let's go and check for now. It won't do us any good staying here.  
**Suu:** Yeah. I don't want to be here too long, and I'm a little bit curious to see what's next on this riddle solving tour!  
**Kaoru:** It doesn't sound that "little bit" curious anymore. Though, since we came this far, we might as well go along too.  
**Kiyoka:** They let us in...  
**Mirja:** We can interpret that as us being correct to come here... No wait, I just got a message. That settles it.  
**Mirja:** The subject is: "This is the final riddle. After that your reward is waiting."  
**Suu:** There's got to be a reward for solving riddles, after all. If they don't have one, that's a scam! A scam!  
**Hirona:** Inami-san... you sure got excited about this. You switch on and off, I get iit.  
**Suu:** After coming this far, you have to get excited for it! Otherwise it'd be like going to a joint live and leaving just before your idol comes out!  
**Sayaka:** I'm glad you want to do it, Suu. Mirja, what's the riddle?  
**Mirja:** I'll read it out loud.  
**Mirja:** --"Think back over today, and visit the shrine dedicated to the god linked to the following 3."  
**Mirja:** "2-middle, 7-left, 9-left". "201921182179". "N4M42U".  
**Mirja:** They specifically advise us to think back over today, so I suppose that means to solve the codes using the previous solutions and guess a specific shrine from these keywords.  
**Hirona:** We know how to solve them, so this should go quick... ...That's helpfull.  
**Hiyori:** ...I got a message too? "The hint this time is you yourself." ...What does that mean?  
**Kiyoka:** Hmm, so then it has some connection to Juujou-san?  
**Kaoru:** The shrine's on the Yamato Plain... That's gotta be it.  
**Hiyori:** That's it. I'm going to kill you.  

## 5: The Future the Present Reaches
**Kiyoka:** Okay, let's start by cracking the codes. The first is "2-middle, 7-left, 9-left". If you put that into a phone, it's... "Ka" "Mi" "Na" Ri" (thunder).  
**Hirona:** Thunder... A natural phenomenonn. I'll write it down.  
**Sayaka:** Next is "201921182179". These numbers are the alphabet. You replace them counting from 1, 2, 3 starting from A.  
**Sayaka:** So Z becomes 26. There's no 0, so the first one has to be the 20th letter of the alphabet.  
**Suu:** T!  
**Kaoru:** There wouldn't be 79 either, so the last one has to be 9. And, the 9th letter is I.  
**Mirja:** These 12 numbers separate into 20, 19, 21, 18, 21, 7, 9 which equals in that order: T, S, U, R, U, G, I.  
**Hiyori:** Reading it out... you get tsurugi (sword). It has to be swords.  
**Hirona:** I did the last one, "N4M42U"... Comparing it to what Mashiko-san found online, it's "NAMAZU"u.  
**Hirona:** Namazu... It's a fish. Ahh... By the way, did you know, replacing letters with characters that look vaguely similar is called "leetspeak"?  
**Sayaka:** Thunder, swords, namazu. Does anyone know what shrine has a god that's related to these?  
**Kaoru:** Oi, Sayaka. You're forgetting the most important one. Thunder, swords, namazu, and, horizon chest.  
**Hiyori:** ......  
**Kaoru:** Try putting your hand on that chest of yours. Anything come to mind?  
**Hiyori:** ...It does. But, let me say one thing. I've been thinking this for a while, but you really don't have the right to talk down to me here, do you?  
**Kaoru:** Maybe I don't. But I'll do it anyway.   
**Hiyori:** You're...... Whatever. Let's get back to the question. When you think of thunder, swords, and namazu, the Japanese god connected to them is Takemikazuchi. He's the god of both thunder and swords.  
**Hiyori:** There was also a widely believed anecdote about him sealing a namazu that was thought to be causing earthquakes.  
**Kiyoka:** Do you have any idea which shrine is dedicated to Takemikazuchi?  
**Hiyori:** At Kashima Shrine. Since I was the hint. It's where the style of swordfighting I use, Kashima Shinto-ryu, is supposed to have originated.  
**Hirona:** Then, that settles it-.  
**Hiyori:** If it is Kashima Shrine... you realize that's in Kashima City in Ibaraki. Are we going to catch trains all the way there?  
**Mirja:** A helicopter showing up now? I suppose that means we should get on board. There's no other choice if we're going.  
**Suu:** EHH-----!?  
**Suu:** WE'RE GETTING ON THAT!?  
**Mirja:** This is where the mystery person sending us messages should be.  
**Kaoru:** They'll probably be coming around any second now.  
**Ellen:** Kaoru-! Happy New Year! You all did really well-!  
**Kaoru:** What'd you send us on this whole goose chase for right on New Year's... I'm supposed to be sitting under a kotatsu eating mikan right about now.  
**Ellen:** Sorry, but I was only here to help out. The evil mastermind is-- Grandpa!  
**Friedman:** Hahaha, you could put it nicer than that, Ellen.  
**Mirja:** ...Dr. Richard Friedman!?  
**Suu:** There's a celebrity!?  
**Sayaka:** Why are you here?  
**Friedman:** I wanted to give you a little surprise as a New Year's greeting.  
**Hiyori:** It didn't seem that little... You went all out. What was the point of all this?  
**Friedman:** It might be a bit late to say it, and I know it's preaching to the choir, but I wanted to give you another chance to think about toji and aradama while having some fun.  
**Friedman:** All the places you visited today were related to the two of them, weren't they?  
**Mirja:** Yes, and they were places we had a personal connection to as well.  
**Friedman:** This nation has spent a long time with aradama. Even if that relationship and the state of things shift, that connection is likely going to remain.  
**Friedman:** And, as toji in service, you all have the ability to shape the state of things in the future. Though, practically speaking, you'll need the support of a great deal of people to make that happen.  
**Friedman:** But, I won't bore you with any more of this. For doing so well on making it here to Kashima Shrine, I'm inviting all of you on a hot springs trip. Think of it as your New Year's gift.  
**Kaoru/Suu:** Hot...   
**Hiyori/Kiyoka:** ...Springs!?  
**Kaoru:** Ahh... but, this is one of those things, right? I'm about to get called back on an urgent mission.  
**Friedman:** No need to worry, during this trip, you'll be completely off the clock. I've already talked it over with the presidents of each school.  
**Mirja:** If you've gone to that extent, then we'll enjoy this vacation to the fullest.  
**Hirona:** It's important to take breaks... I appreciate the hot springs too. It's what's most important.  
**Kaoru:** ......  
**Kaoru:** Oohhhhh! You planned this all out perfect, grandpa! It's so perfect I didn't know what to say for a second. Ellen, your grandpa's the best!  
**Ellen:** I'm really happy you can tell how great Grandpa is, Kaoru.  
**Ellen:** And then, tomorrow, we can all go again and do our first shrine visit together! I hope we'll all get along this year~!
