## 1: On a New Year's Trip for Two!
**Mihono:** Pant, pant... Thank goodness! We made it to the train right on schedule.  
**Chie:** Slow down, Mihono-chan! Honestly, if we missed this train, we could have just caught the next one. Why are you in such a rush?  
**Mihono:** That's cause, I get to go on a big trip with Chii-nee, of course! There's a whole bunch of things I want to do, so I want to follow the schedule exactly.  
**Mihono:** Ah! That reminds me. These are our schedules for this trip. This one's for you, Chii-nee.  
**Chie:** You made these yourself!? They're thick too, aren't they...  
**Mihono:** Ehehe. Once I started writing down all the places I wanted to see and the things I wanted to do, it started getting really long.  
**Chie:** Fufu. Well, thank you for going to the trouble. And also, this schedule is so detailed, isn't it? You have what we'll be doing divided down to the minutes.  
**Mihono:** I thought we'd get through every one of my goals for the trip, so it ended up being tighter than I expected. But, when it's us two, where there's a will, there's a way! Right?  
**Chie:** Well, if we go down the list, we might be able to manage it... But, don't you think it would be better to relax a bit more?  
**Mihono:** We can't do that! Let's do all of it! Cause we came on this trip together!  
**Chie:** (? Mihono-chan's acting different than usual... I wonder what's gotten into her...)  
**Mihono:** Hey, we can do all of it, right? That'll be fine, right, Chii-nee?  
**Chie:** O-Of course, so long as you're happy, Mihono-chan. It is our last trip of the year, after all.  
**Mihono:** ...  
**Chie:** ...What's wrong? You're making such a sad face.  
**Mihono:** Ah-! It's nothing! Yeah, I'm just fine! It's all alright!  
**Chie:** Are you sure? Then, if you say so...  
**Chie:** Oh, I'm getting a call from school. What if it's about a mission... I'll just step out of the compartment for a minute while I take this.  
**Mihono:** She left...  
**Kiyoka:** Oh? Hono-chan. What are you doing here? Are you going somewhere?  
**Mihono:** Kiyoka! And Iwakura-san too! You too; what are you doing here?  
**Sanae:** We're on our way to take care of an expedition assignment. Everyone else seems to already be on their New Year's break, but this is our last work day of the year.  
**Kiyoka:** What about you, Hono-chan? You're already on your vacation, aren't you?  
**Mihono:** Yeah! Chii-nee and me are using our New Year's break to go on a trip together, starting today. See, look at this! It's our trip guide. I made it myself, and I'm pretty proud of how it turned out!  
**Sanae:** Wow, that's incredible! The schedule is packed tight too; it's just dripping with your excitement for the trip.  
**Kiyoka:** It sure is. I think it seems like a little much to do in just two days and one night though...  
**Mihono:** Well, that's because, Chii-nee's going to...  
**Mihono:** Ah! Nevermind that! It's nothing, so don't worry about it! Okay!  
**Sanae:** Doesn't it seem like Asakura-san was hiding something just now?  
**Kiyoka:** It does. It's like Hono-chan's worried about something important on this trip...  
**Kiyoka:** Ahh, while we were chatting, we arrived at our stop. Anyway, Hono-chan, have fun on your trip, okay.  
**Mihono:** Thanks--! You two take care too!  
**Mihono:** ...Chii-nee sure is taking a while. I wonder if she's still on the phone...  
**Chie:** Mihono-chan, sorry I took so long! I bought ice cream from the train. Let's have it together.  
**Mihono:** Awesome-! Thanks, Chii-nee! I'll dig right in...  
**Mihono:** Wait, huh!? The ice cream's so frozen my spoon won't go in!   
**Chie:** Fufu, you're right. It's a frozen as ice. We'll have to warm it up so it gets softer.  
**Chie:** ~~! So cold!   
**Chie:** !? Mihono-chan? You didn't have to take a picture now...  
**Mihono:** But, isn't getting to see you warming up ice cream with your hands the kind of thing you'd see on a trip?  
**Chie:** Honestly... Then, at least take it with the both of us. Just set it on a timer, and...  
**Chie:** Oh, the ice cream's melting! Mihono-chan, here you go.  
**Mihono:** Thanks! Ahhm!  
**Mihono:** Look, look, Chii-nee! It took the picture right when we were taking abite!  
**Chie:** Wow, it sure did! You can see the scenery out the window too. We've only just started and already we've gotten a wonderful photo of our trip.  
**Mihono:** Yeah! Let's keep this up and make a whole bunch of memories here!  
**Chie:** Sure!  
**Chie:** ...Ah! It looks like we're here at the station. Mihono-chan, be sure you don't forget anything, okay?  
**Mihono:** Here we are! In the guidebook, it says the locals welcome tourists here with singing and dancing, but...  
**Aradama:** Guooooo...  
**Chie:** Aradama! For them to be here of all places.  
**Mihono:** And our trip's barely even started! We have to get rid of them quick, so we can make a bunch of memories like we planned on!  

## 2: It's Hard Sticking to the Schedule!?
**Mihono:** Phew, we beat the aradama, so let's get our trip back on track!  
**Chie:** First, we need to try the limited offer mitarashi dango they sell at the station...  
**Chie:** Oh no; they're all sold out for today!?  
**Mihono:** Eh-!? But...  
**Shopkeeper:** Sorry about that, we just sold out. If you'd been here five minutes sooner...  
**Mihono:** Uuu... Just five minutes... If only those aradama weren't here...  
**Chie:** There's nothing we can do about it. Even if we are off duty, it's still a toji's responsibility to suppress aradama.  
**Shopkeeper:** Oh, you two were dealing with some aradama? Then, as thanks, take this. It's fresh bread from a local bakery.  
**Mihono:** Whoaa~, it smells great. And it's warm too; I bet it's yummy!  
**Shopkeeper:** About that bakery, they don't mention it in the guidebooks. It's a special little place only the locals know about. Here, eat it before it goes cold.  
**Chie:** Thank you very much. Then, we'll take you up on that. Ohm...  
**Chie:** Mm, it's delicious!  
**Mihono:** It really is! This is good! It's nice and hot and fluffy; I feel like I could eat this forever!  
**Chie:** Fufu, I'm glad to see you're cheering up now, Mihono-chan. Suppressing the aradama might have taken some of our time, but because of that, we found something nice we weren't expecting.  
**Mihono:** Yeah, it's all because the locals were nice to us that we got to eat such good bread. This'll be a good memory too, won't it!  
**Sanae:** Hm? We ran into each other again!  
**Chie:** Kiyoka-chan, Sanae-chan! You two were on an expedition, weren't you? Did you finish that up already?  
**Sanae:** Yes. We managed to take care of it sooner than expected, so I talked with Musumi-san about doing a little sightseeing before we went back.  
**Kiyoka:** If you take the bus from in front of the station, you can get to a a lake with a power spot that's secretly famous.  
**Mihono:** For real!? That wasn't in any of the guidebooks I read, but it sounds cool! Chii-nee, do you want to go check it out too?  
**Chie:** Sure! Having a spur of the moment change of plans is part of the thrill of going on a trip. Let's go see!  
**Sanae:** If we're all going, then let's hurry over to the bus stop. The bus only comes twice per day, so we have to be careful not to miss it.  
**Mihono:** This place is that rare, huh! I'm getting excited; it's like we're going exploring!  
**Aradama:** Guooooooo...  
**Mihono:** Eh-!? More aradama!? This time for sure, I won't let them ruin our trip!  
**Kiyoka:** Let's all fight our best, to get to that power spot!  
**Chie:** Here I go! HAA!  
**Sanae:** TAAAAAAH!  
**Kiyoka:** Pant, pant... No matter how many we defeat, more are appearing... This might be too much for the four of us...  
**Mihono:** Uuu... We're running out of time doing this too-!  
**Maki:** We'll be backing you up!  
**Sanae:** Shidou-senpai!?  
**Mihono:** And Tsubakuro-san too!  
**Yume:** Kyahaha. Looks like I'll be able to beat a whole ton of them here!  
**Yume:** EIII---!  

## 3: On a Big Fun Girls Tour Together!
**Chie:** With Shidou-san and Tsubakuro-san's help, we managed to clean them all out.  
**Sanae:** But still, what brings you two here anyway?  
**Maki:** We were on our way back from an expedition, and just happened to be passing through. I'm glad we could lend a hand.  
**Yume:** It wasn't really enough to satisfy me though-. And hey, what are those onee-sans looking all sad for?  
**Mihono:** Uuu... The bus that only comes twice a day left already...  
**Kiyoka:** It's a shame, but I'll have to come see this power spot another time. Sigh...  
**Chie:** Hey, you two. There's so many other things left for us to do, soit's a waste for you to be moping around now. Let's cheer up and move on to our next destination!  
**Sanae:** Setouchi-san is right! There should be plenty of things left that we can do now. Like, if we leave from this neighborhood now, we can...  
**Maki:** Nn? What's that? That big book with all those notes in it.  
**Sanae:** It's the trip guidebook Asakura-san made. They were supposed to follow this and have a good time sightseeing, but then aradama appeared...  
**Maki:** I see. It must be frustrating having plans this detailed getting spoiled like that.  
**Yume:** Let me see it too!  
**Yume:** Hmm-! I didn't think there'd be this many neat sounding places this close by here.  
**Yume:** Maki-onee-san, we should go see them too!  
**Maki:** Unfortunately, I've got another mission to take care of, so I can't guide you around. We can do it some other time.  
**Yume:** Ehh-, but, after coming all the way out here, I wanna play around some-.  
**Chie:** In that case, would you like to join us, Tsubakuro-san?  
**Mihono:** Good idea! I wanna thank you for helping us out, and it's more fun with more people!  
**Sanae:** Shidou-senpai, we'll take responsibility and make sure she gets home safe, so please don't worry and go on your mission.  
**Maki:** Alright. If you insist, then I guess I'll leave her with you.  
**Maki:** Yume, make sure you do what they tell you, okay?  
**Yume:** Hooray-! Come on, onee-sans, let's go right now!  
**Chie:** Wow, the stained glass is gorgeous. It was beautiful on the outside, but inside the building, there's such a lovely old fashioned feeling to it.  
**Mihono:** A bunch of guidebooks said you just had to see the stained glass at this church!  
**???:** ~~  
**Yume:** Huh? I hear some pretty voices singing.  
**Sanae:** It sounds like it's practice time for the choir. Getting to hear hymns being sung live in such a romantic place is a real luxury!  
**Mihono:** We must be really lucky, showing up just in time for them to start practicing!  
**Chie:** That's for sure. Our plans were thrown off due to the aradama, but we got to experience something this nice thanks to it.  
**Sanae:** So, next is a cake shop in a studio up in the mountains. Even though it's so far from town, there's so many customers here!  
**Kiyoka:** It seems popular enough that people will come far and wide to eat here. Hono-chan, we found a really nice shop!  
**Mihono:** Ehehe, we sure did! Still, there's so many different kinds of cakes, and they all look so good, that it's tough making up your mind!  
**Chie:** Fufu, in that case, how about we split ours with each other? That way you can have double the cakes.  
**Mihono:** Oh yeah! Nice idea! I'll have this strawberry shortcake then! I'll give you the part with the big strawberry, Chii-nee!  
**Chie:** You can have the chestnuts off the top of my Mont Blanc then, Mihono-chan.  
**Yume:** Those onee-sans really get along, don't they.  
**Kiyoka:** They sure do. Just watching them together makes me feel happier.  
**Mihono:** Phwah-! That tasted so good! Guys-, if you're done eating, next up is a horseriding experience at a farm close by!  
**Sanae:** Even though we've been stopping by one place after another, there's still more to see? This really is a whirlwind tour.  
**Mihono:** Since we had the chance to go on this trip, I wanted to do as much as we can before the sun goes down!  
**Yume:** I want to ride on the horsies too! Let's go there fast, onee-sans!  
**Aradama:** Guooooo...  
**Yume:** Hey-! Why'd aradama have to come out now!  
**Mihono:** We might've gotten to see a bunch of fun stuff because aradama messed up our schedule, but I still hate them getting in our way!  
**Chie:** Agreed; let's make sure to defeat them now so they can't interrupt us any more!  

## 4: Enjoying a Trip to the Hot Springs
**Yume:** Eh-, while we were busy beating the aradama, the sun went down!  
**Mihono:** Uuu... After the horseriding, we were supposed to do mandarin picking at an orange farm, and then there were a ton ton ton more things I wanted to do---!  
**Chie:** Mihono-chan, cheer up. It's gotten cold now, so wouldn't it be fine if we just relax at the ryokan and pass the end of the year together?  
**Chie:** Getting in some hot springs and taking your time in a nice yet unfamiliar room is part of enjoying a trip too, isn't it?  
**Mihono:** You're right, that does sound fun too, but... Uuu...  
**Kiyoka:** Don't let it get you down, Hono-chan. We're going back now, but you two have a wonderful stay at a ryokan booked for you, don't you?  
**Sanae:** That's right; didn't you write in the guide all the things you wanted to do in your room together? I'm sure you'll still have lots of fun from here!  
**Mihono:** ...You're right! This is no time for me to be down in the dumps!  
**Yume:** Thanks to you onee-sans, I got to have a really fun New Year's Eve~. Have fun at the hot springs, okay?  
**Mihono:** Wow, this room is so pretty looking! Getting this whole big room just for me and Chii-nee is so deluxe-!  
**Chie:** Isn't it? Let's take a short rest here, then go to the hot springs. It seems like they let you reserve open air baths too.  
**Mihono:** Whoa-! I'm getting excited for it now! And dinner will be waiting for us after we get out of the baths, so there's still lots of fun to have together!  
**Mihono:** Ahh-, I ate my fill back there. The hot springs felt so good after eating too. I'm feeling nice~.  
**Mihono:** So, uh, next on the schedule is... An end of the year card tournament with Chii-nee!  
**Chie:** Fufu, you're just full of energy, aren't you.  
**Chie:** Mihono-chan, the year isn't quite over yet, but thank you for spending it with me.  
**Mihono:** Chii-nee... Don't go saying it's over or anything!  
**Chie:** Eh? Why not, Mihono-chan?  
**Mihono:** Ah... Nevermind, it's nothing. Sorry about that.  Now, where'd I put the cards...  
**Chie:** (What's come over Mihono-chan? That reminds me, there was a time on the train ride when she acted different from her usual self too.)  
**Chie:** (Maybe she was so excited for this that she couldn't sleep last night? If that's what it is, then I can't let her push herself too hard.)  
**Chie:** Mihono-chan, come lie here on this futon for a minute.  
**Mihono:** Eh? What's this for, Chii-nee?  
**Chie:** You must be tired from running around since this morning, right? I'll give you a massage.  
**Mihono:** Ehh!? You will?  
**Chie:** Fufu, of course I will. It's a show of my appreciation for all the fun places you took me to. Here, lie down.  
**Mihono:** If you say so, then...  
**Mihono:** ...Ahh... That feels so good~.  
**Mihono:** Chii-nee, your hands are so waaarm.  
**Chie:** Fufu, just lie back and relax.  
**Mihono:** Sure... Fuaahh... It's like my back is melting; it's too good~.  
**Mihono:** Haa~... That feels nice...  
**Mihono:** Fuah~... Nnn~... Zzz...  
**Chie:** Oh, Mihono-chan? Fufu, she's sleeping now.  
**Chie:** ...Her face is so innocent when she's asleep. I wonder what she's dreaming about.  
**Mihono:** [mumble mumble]... Chii-nee... We're going here next...! Chii-nee... Ngh...  
**Chie:** Even in her dreams, she's still leading me around. Thank you very much for taking me on a pleasant journey, Mihono-chan.  
**Chie:** Yawn~. Looking at how happily Mihono-chan's sleeping is making me feel drowsy too.  
**Chie:** It doesn't look like we'll be able to do a countdown to the new year, so I'll just lie down and we can sleep together.  
**Chie:** [sleep breathing]...  
**Mihono:** [sleep mumbling]...  
**Mihono:** Nn...?  
**Mihono:** WAHH------!!  
**Mihono:** (No way-! I fell asleep!?)  
**Mihono:** (What do I do now; we might not make it for the most important part of this trip--!!)

## 5: Will We Make to the Main Event!?
**Chie:** ......? Mihono-chan? What's the matter? It's still pitch dark outside...  
**Mihono:** Chii-nee, get up! If we don't get out there soon, the first sunrise'll happen!  
**Chie:** If you want to see the sunrise, we can do it from the window here, you know.  
**Mihono:** There's someplace I want to go with you no matter what though! I want us to see the first sunrise from there-!  
**Chie:** (It's been on my mind ever since yesterday, but why is Mihono-chan acting so frantic? Does she have some special reason...?)  
**Chie:** Alright then. If you really want to go, let's go see the first sunrise together.  
**Mihono:** Uuu, I was prepared for this, but it's still freezing... Are you doing okay, Chii-nee? Sorry, for forcing you to come out in the cold with me.  
**Chie:** I'm just fine. But, look at you, your hands are all red. Here, why not use my gloves?  
**Mihono:** If I did that, then your hands would get cold! I'll be fine! See, I'm doing great...  
**Mihono:** Achoo!  
**Chie:** Honestly... You're pushing yourself so hard, Mihono-chan.  
**Chie:** Here, we'll each wear one of my gloves. And then, we can hold each other's hands with the hand that doesn't have a glove on. Alright?  
**Mihono:** Whoa! Your hand is so warm, Chii-nee.  
**Chie:** Fufu, that's better, isn't it? It's almost time for the sunrise, so let's keep going!  
**Mihono:** Yeah!  
**Chie:** It's getting brighter out. Are we almost to where we're going?  
**Mihono:** Ahh, look down the path! The first sunrise is coming up!  
**Chie:** Wow... You're right! It's beautiful...!  
**Mihono:** ...I'm so glad we made it. I got to see the first sunrise with Chii-nee...!  
**Chie:** Mmhm. I'm glad I got to see such a beautiful sunrise with you, Mihono-chan.  
**Chie:** Thank you for bringing me along.  
**Mihono:** I'm really happy I got to see the first sunrise together with you too, Chii-nee.  
**Mihono:** But...  
**Chie:** What's wrong, Mihono-chan?  
**Mihono:** Fighting with aradama took up our time, so we didn't get to do half the things I wanted to...  
**Chie:** Oh, Mihono-chan... Don't you think there were too many things to do on your list in the first place? Why were you so desperate to do them all?  
**Mihono:** That's because...  
**Mihono:** Since you're four grades higher, you're about to graduate before me, right? And, when you do, we might be split up again...  
**Mihono:** So that's why, while we still have time together, I wanted to make as many memories as possible.  
**Chie:** Mihono-chan...  
**Chie:** Come here.  
**Mihono:** Wah, you're making me embarassed, rubbing my head out here like that-.  
**Chie:** Fufu, what's wrong with it.  
**Chie:** You know, Mihono-chan. From now on, whatever path I take, the two of us will always be together. So don't worry.  
**Chie:** So, the places we didn't get to go on this trip, we can go see together the next time.  
**Mihono:** Chii-nee...  
**Chie:** Fufu, thank goodness. You're smiling again, Mihono-chan.  
**Chie:** I know, let's make a wish on the first sunrise. A wish that we'll be able to peacefully spend another year together.  
**Mihono:** Good idea! After all we went through to see this sunrise, whatever we wish for is gonna get granted for sure!  
**Mihono/Chie:** This year, and the next year, and every year after that, please let us stay happily together!
