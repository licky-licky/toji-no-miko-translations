<strong>Yomi:</strong> All student members of the executive committee have assembled here.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> That&#x27;s right. We should get this meeting started straight away.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Members of the executive committee, thank you all for gathering today to discuss the Five Traditions Unified School Festival. I&#x27;m Shidou Maki, filling the role of committee chairman.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> I, Konohana Suzuka, am assistant executive committee chairman. Everyone, let&#x27;s work together to create a wonderful festival.<br>
<strong>Students:</strong> Yes!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> (What do I do... I wasn&#x27;t thinking, so I thought &quot;Joining the school festival&#x27;s executive committee sounds exciting!&quot;, but now...)<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> (This feels like it could be a much more serious job...)<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> To begin with, we need to settle on which activities the school festival will be performing. Does anyone have any ideas they&#x27;d like to propose?<br>
<strong>Students:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Nobody...?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> It takes courage to be the first to state your opinion. Perhaps we should begin by offering our own proposals?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Good point. Then, I&#x27;ll start with my idea. With toji from every school gathered here, why don&#x27;t we hold a tournament that decides the strongest of them all?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ooh, let&#x27;s do that, let&#x27;s do that! It sounds fun!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Right?<br>
<strong>Female Student A:</strong> <em>whispering</em> Wait, but then it sounds like non-toji students don&#x27;t get to do anything...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Maki-san, Yume. That would be no different from the official yearly tournament.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Er, you have a point...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Coming up with an idea for the festival is harder than it seems. What do you think, Suzuka?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Let&#x27;s see... Since it is a festival after all, why not hold a formal dress party?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Along with that, it would be nice to invite an orchestra to perform a classical concert for us.<br>
<strong>Female Student B:</strong> <em>whispering</em> What does a formal party have to do with a school festival...<br>
<strong>Female Student C:</strong> <em>whispering</em> A classical concert is gonna put people to sleep...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> That&#x27;s way too serious, Suzuka onee-san! It just sounds boring!<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> We should do a swordfighting tournament after all-! Everyone from the Five Traditions is gonna be there anyway~!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Hmmm... Yomi, why don&#x27;t you tell us what you think?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> In my case... I have no preference when it comes to the subject of the school festival.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> But, I think it&#x27;s necessary we consider in advance what kind of aradama countermeasures to prepare.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> What&#x27;s wrong, Maki-san?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ...Nothing, I just remembered a request that President Hashima and President Gojou asked of me.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> What&#x27;d those old ladies want?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> They said &quot;When it comes to the Five Traditions unified school festival, be sure to keep it student appropriate and do something everyone attending can enjoy.&quot;<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Thinking on the &quot;student appropriate&quot; part, our suggestions have been somewhat off, haven&#x27;t they.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> But what should we do...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Um...<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> What is it? Musumi Kiyoka. If you have a proposal, speak up and share it.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Y-Yes!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Um... I&#x27;m not sure if my ideas will be any good, but...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Don&#x27;t be shy, tell everyone.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Uh... We could all wear cute matching dresses, and work at a maid cafe?<br>
<strong>Female Student D:</strong> Huh... Well that&#x27;s better than a swordfighting tournament or a classical concert.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> And then... We could get the girls who are good at singing and dancing together, and have a live show on stage!<br>
<strong>Female Student A:</strong> That could work! I&#x27;ve always wanted to be a part of a girl band!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> And also, all the students from all the schools could do a beauty pageant!<br>
<strong>Female Student B:</strong> Sounds like fun! My girl&#x27;s better looking than most, you know.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> That&#x27;s surprising... They were so quiet before, but now they&#x27;re all joining in.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah... I&#x27;m sorry! I&#x27;m talking too much, aren&#x27;t I.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Not at all. Your ideas seem to be quite popular.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Everyone, what do you think about using her suggestions?<br>
<strong>Students:</strong> WE APPROVE-!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> (Thank goodness. I think I managed to help out.)  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="2-distribution-of-roles"></a>2: Distribution of Roles<a class="hash-link" href="#2-distribution-of-roles" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Maki:</strong> Okay, now we have a general idea of what activities we&#x27;ll be doing during the festival. To continue, we should assign everyone&#x27;s positions.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Members of the executive committee will be responsible for different roles on the day of the school festival. If there&#x27;s a position you want, you can go ahead and claim it...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> In that case, why not let Musumi-san, who came up with those great suggestions, choose the role she wants first.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> N-No, I couldn&#x27;t! I&#x27;d be fine helping with any position! The maid cafe, the beauty pageant, or the live stage, I&#x27;ll do my best to help wherever you need me to!<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Musumi-san, are you sure about that?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Yes. There&#x27;s so many things I want to do that it&#x27;s hard to pick just one... I know! To keep things fair, why don&#x27;t we use a lottery to decide?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Understood. If that&#x27;s how you want it, we&#x27;ll do it.  </p><p>After drawing the lottery--</p><p><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Aww...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> (I said I&#x27;d do my best at anything, but I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d draw the most boring one...)<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> (Security duty patrolling the neighborhood. Which means, I have to be standing around far away from the actual festival...)<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> How did it come to this... Why am I assigned to the maid cafe?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> What are the chances, that&#x27;s my position too. And Yume and Yomi&#x27;s as well.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> There&#x27;s gonna be lots of guests coming to the maid cafe, right? Since they&#x27;re all coming from the Five Traditions, that means there could be strong girls in there too! I wanna fight them already!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yume... A maid cafe is no place to be starting fights.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> ...<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ......<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> What&#x27;s with you two?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Does this mean I&#x27;ll have to be serving guests in a maid uniform...?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> It&#x27;s nothing... The lottery&#x27;s outcome has me slightly shocked...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I know what you mean. It was a bit of a shock for me too, being on the security team...<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ...Musumi-san, I have a proposal. You could trade duties with me.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Eh, you don&#x27;t have to go that far!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I see, I hadn&#x27;t considered that... If I could be on the security team instead, then I&#x27;d rather...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Maki-san, Yomi. You can&#x27;t always go around expecting to only do security work.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I know, but... I can&#x27;t be a maid...<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> I&#x27;d be better suited patrolling the area than serving guests...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Ehh, then I want to be doing that too!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Hold it right there! We of the elite guard have been entrusted to supervise and manage this entire school festival.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> So don&#x27;t you think it would be wrong to have three of us patrolling outside the school grounds?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ...When you say it that way, it&#x27;s difficult not to agree...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Unless something urgent happens, the elite guard should remain inside the school grounds.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> It&#x27;s like you said... Yomi, I think we should try to do the duties the lottery gave us, but what do you think?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> ...I understand. Whatever task I&#x27;m given, I will do everything in my power to carry out.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> (...It&#x27;s disappointing, but I&#x27;ll try to do my best on patrol too...)  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="3-grand-opening-the-five-traditions-unified-school-festival"></a>3: Grand Opening! The Five Traditions Unified School Festival<a class="hash-link" href="#3-grand-opening-the-five-traditions-unified-school-festival" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>On the day of the Five Traditions Unified School Festival--</p><p><strong>Maki:</strong> There&#x27;s more guests than I expected. I knew the executive committee would be busy, but can they handle this...?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Everyone&#x27;s putting in a good effort. You too, Maki-san. When you have the time, feel free to take a break. You must be tired; you were running around all morning.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> This much is nothing for me... Or I&#x27;d like to say that, but this is too different from the duties I&#x27;m used to. I don&#x27;t want to make any mistakes, so I&#x27;ll rest while I can.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Hey, hey, aren&#x27;t you onee-sans gonna be maids too?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> It isn&#x27;t our shift yet.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Though, Yume. Aren&#x27;t you supposed to be serving at the cafe right now? Want to explain why you&#x27;re out here still in your usual uniform?<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Boo. It&#x27;s no fun there if you and Suzuka onee-san aren&#x27;t gonna come!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Still, we decided that it was your duty to be there right now. You have to stick to the schedule. Go on, hurry up back to the cafe.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Fiiine.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Alright, next they need me as an announcer on stage. Starting in three minutes. If I hurry, I can make it in time.  </p><p>At that time, outside the school festival grounds--</p><p><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Sigh... I know security is important and all... But am I really going to miss the whole festival standing out here...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> The band should be playing up on stage right about now. That must be so exciting...<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Huh? Kiyoka?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> What are you doing out here?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Hono-chan! And you too, Setouchi-san. Why are you here?<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> The crepe stand we&#x27;re managing ran out of ingredients, so we had to run out and buy more.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> You should come check it out later, Kiyoka. Chii-nee makes some super yummy crepes!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I wish I could go, but... I&#x27;m busy with my duties.<br>
<strong>Chie:</strong> That&#x27;s right, you&#x27;re on the executive committee, aren&#x27;t you? You must have a lot of responsibilities.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Yes, it&#x27;s my job today to patrol the perimeter of the school festival.<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Oh, really? Sorry, we had no idea and came up and bothered you...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> No, don&#x27;t worry about it!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> But Hono-chan, you should get going. Everyone&#x27;s waiting for you to bring back those ingredients, right?<br>
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah... Then, I&#x27;ll see you later, Kiyoka.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Have a good time.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Sigh... Now I&#x27;m alone again.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> That crepe stand sounds like fun... The maid cafe must be busy too...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Huh? Someone&#x27;s calling.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It&#x27;s from Shidou-san! Why would she call me...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Hello, this is executive committee member Musumi Kiyoka, on patrol. What do you need from me?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> An emergency came up. Musumi Kiyoka, return to the school as fast as possible.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Eh-, what happened...?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I&#x27;ll explain the details after you arrive. Come quickly.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> She hung up... What sort of emergency do they need me for?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah... Does that mean aradama appeared in the festival!?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> I have to get back there!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Pant... Pant... Musumi Kiyoka, is here.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Good, you&#x27;re here already. Something unexpected came up.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Yes, please tell me what happened!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Right, actually... The maid cafe is a runaway success, and we&#x27;re severely understaffed there...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Eh...?  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="4-the-school-festival-i-dreamt-of"></a>4: The School Festival I Dreamt Of<a class="hash-link" href="#4-the-school-festival-i-dreamt-of" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Kiyoka:</strong> The maid cafe... Is understaffed? Then, why did you call me here...?<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> I&#x27;m sorry to ask this suddenly, but I want you to change positions to serving at the maid cafe.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Y-You want me to be a maid?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Yes. We&#x27;ve decided to reassign 10% of the security team to the maid cafe. And you&#x27;re one of them.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Your uniform has already been prepared for you. Once you&#x27;re ready, begin standing in the hall and helping guests.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Um... But then, will there be enough people helping security?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> You shouldn&#x27;t be concerned with that. In place of the ones reassigned, I will become part of the security team.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Just by yourself, Satsuki-san...?<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Extensive search and lookout assignments are my specialty.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> If that&#x27;s all, I&#x27;ll go to my post.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah... Satsuki-san, she left...<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Is it really okay, letting Satsuki-san handle that much by herself?<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Of course. Interacting with the guests was leaving Yomi fairly worn out.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> We decided it would be a better use of their talents putting people in roles they&#x27;re more accustomed to.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Musumi Kiyoka. I&#x27;d like for you to start working in your new position straight away.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Ah... Understood! Of course I will!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> (I can&#x27;t believe I get to serve guests at the maid cafe! I&#x27;m so glad I tried the executive committee!)<br>
<strong>Passing Guest:</strong> Excuse me, I want to go to the maid cafe. Can you tell me which way it is?<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> In that case, I&#x27;ll guide you there, master!<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Musumi-san immediately understands how to win a guest&#x27;s heart. Having them switch positions was the right idea after all.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> Agreed. Everyone has something they&#x27;re better cut out for.  </p><p>And like that, the school festival finished without incident--</p><p><strong>Maki:</strong> So it&#x27;s already time to shut it down. I&#x27;m glad everything went smoothly.<br>
<strong>Yomi:</strong> Because of my reassignment, I was also able to fulfill my duties until the end. Thank you very much.<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> We received nothing but praise from both our guests and the presidents. Job well done, everyone.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> It&#x27;s a little sad, saying goodbye already...<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> You looked like you were having a lot of fun being a maid, Onee-san!<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> That&#x27;s for sure. Even I was hearing about the reputation you built up among the guests.<br>
<strong>Maki:</strong> From helping with the preparations, to working security, to even serving guests, having you around was a huge relief. Thanks.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> You don&#x27;t have to go that far... I just wanted to have a good time with everyone...<br>
<strong>Suzuka:</strong> Everything turned out so well in part thanks to those feelings. I&#x27;d like to thank you as well, Musumi-san.<br>
<strong>Yume:</strong> Yeah, you helped me out a lot too! Thanks, Onee-san!<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> Hearing that from all of you... Makes me glad.<br>
<strong>Kiyoka:</strong> (I was nervous at first... But I&#x27;m glad I tried this...)</p></div><footer class="docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="row"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/swordpolishing/tnm-translations/edit/docs/Grand_Opening_The_Five_Traditions_Unified_School_Festival.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_2_ui" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_13-_"></div></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"></div></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_35-E thin-scrollbar"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#1-the-unified-school-festival-executive-committee" class="table-of-contents__link">1: The Unified School Festival Executive Committee</a></li><li><a href="#2-distribution-of-roles" class="table-of-contents__link">2: Distribution of Roles</a></li><li><a href="#3-grand-opening-the-five-traditions-unified-school-festival" class="table-of-contents__link">3: Grand Opening!
