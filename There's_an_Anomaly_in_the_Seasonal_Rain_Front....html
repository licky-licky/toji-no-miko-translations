We expect the rainy season to have cleared up by this weekend.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> (Ah, the rainy season is ending.)<br><strong>Mai:</strong> (We'll finally have some sun for once... What should I do? Of course, I should take care of the laundry that's been gathering up, but it's sort of lonesome if that's all I have planned, isn't it?)<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Mai-chan, what are you watching on TV?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Oh, Kanami-chan.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> It's just the weather report. They say the rainy season will clear up this weekend.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Really!? It feels like it's been raining forever; that's great news.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> It's not like I don't like rain, but sometimes you just want to go outside and exercise, don't you?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Sure!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> ...You know, it's been a while since we had a chance to talk with just the two of us, hasn't it?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Now that you mention it... I think it has.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> It's fun with all of us together, but sometimes I want to hang out with just us two.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Ah, I've been thinking the same thing!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> In that case, this weekend... Do you want to go on a trip with me? We could wake up early, and bring bento with us.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> It's a picnic!! Sounds like fun; let's do it, Mai-chan!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Is there anywhere you want to go?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Where to go... Oh, I know where. There's somewhere I want to take you.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Take me? Hmm, where could that be? Tell me, Mai-chan!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> It's... A secret, until we get there.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> (If Kanami-chan doesn't remember... Then it would be kind of sad.)<br>--The day before the picnic.</p><p><strong>Mai:</strong> Let's get everything ready for the bento! Since we're having a picnic and all, I can get a little extravagant.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Karaage, ginger fried pork, hijiki kinpira. With this many brown colored foods, I should add a side dish of boiled spinach with soy sauce, tamagoyaki with tomatoes, and some Chinese style cucumber salad!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> After that... Kanami-chan's favorite: natto over rice! ...I can't make that now though... Oh, right! I can just set the rice cooker for tomorrow morning... There!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Fufu~. Mr. Teru Teru Bozu, I'll be needing your help tomorrow~. [teru teru bozu are simple dolls made to pray for a sunny day]<br>--The day of the picnic.</p><p><strong>Weatherman:</strong> --In what would normally be an unthinkable weather pattern, it seems the rainy season will be continuing over this particular area for a while longer.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Eh!?  
<strong>Mai:</strong> (The rainy season cleared up everywhere besides the spot we were planning to go picnicking at!?)<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Look at that... The rain front's a total V shape. It's like it got stuck on something there.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Is it cause of the air pressure or something?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> ...Sigh.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> (There's nothing I can do about it. The bento is already made, so I'll search for a place nearby with a good view, and we can go there instead!)  
<strong>Mai:</strong> (It's a shame I won't be able to take Kanami-chan to that spot though...)<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Hey, it's a mission!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> They messaged me too. And...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> ...Oh, that's right, me too.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Let's see, the members are... Myself, Kanami-chan, Hiyori-chan, Shichinosato-san, and Yui-chan. The five of us will be going... Eh?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> There!?  
<strong>Mai:</strong> (I never thought we would be coming here like this...)<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> GOTCHAAAA!!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Nice going, Kofuki-san!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Ha ha ha! Keep the aradama-chan coming-!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Anyway... With the aradama appearing right where the rain front is sticking around, the rain sure isn't making this any better.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> That's not true, Hiyori-chan! In fact, with it soaking shirts see through, I say bring on the rain!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...You're always like this, aren't you.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> It's too bad, Mai-chan. We got pulled into this mission all of a sudden...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I know. But still, our duty as toji is important, so let's set our feelings aside and work our hardest.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Right!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Though, I did make our bento, so I would at least like to share it today.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I'm sure everyone would love to share your bento, Mai-chan!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> By the way, isn't this place--<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Huh? Look over here, everyone! A teru teru bozu came out with the noro!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Teru teru bozu? Why was that in there?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> I bet the aradama were wishing tomorrow would be bright and sunny too! ...Just kidding.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> No, wait... Look at that!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> It's brightening up? But, it was pouring rain just a minute ago...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Fufufu, it's all becoming clear now...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> The reason this place is the only spot where the rain didn't go away is because the aradama stole the teru teru bozu!!  </p><h2 id="2-clearing-away-the-rain-and-eating-bento" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>2: Clearing Away the Rain and Eating Bento</h2><p><strong>Yui:</strong> Fufufu, it's all becoming clear now...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> The reason this place is the only spot where the rain didn't go away is because the aradama stole the teru teru bozu!!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Get real.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> (Defeating the aradama gets rid of the rain? Could that actually be the case?)<br><strong>Mai:</strong> (I did see the rain stop with my own eyes though...)<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I'm going to check the weather forecast site real quick.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> What's it say, Mai-chan?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I can hardly believe it, but... The weather front moved just a little bit north.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> See! It's just like I was saying!<br><strong>Yui:</strong> We have to get back the teru teru bozus, all filled up with everyone's wishes for sunny skies... That's our mission here!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> But, still... What do you think, Mai?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> ...Teru teru bozu have been a tradition since ancient times, so maybe there's some sort of cause and effect happening here...?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Is that how this works...?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ahaha, well, that might be what's happening, so we should try doing like Yui-chan says. People worked hard to make those teru teru bozu, so let's get them back.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Kanami-chan... I love you!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Get off of her. It's wet and gross enough as it is without you making things more muggy.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> This isn't muggy at all! Actually, it's pretty cold after the rain...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> I just made a sound unbecoming of a maiden! [her stomach growled]<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Who are you calling a maiden.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> No matter how you look at me, I'm a maiden, aren't I!? Anywayyy, my heart might be full, but my stomach right now...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I did bring a bento box with me... Would you like to have some?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> I'd eat it even if it were poison!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Then we should eat now, whil the rain's stopped!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> I'd hate to have the bento Mai-chan worked so hard to make get rained on.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Hmm, it's simple, yet carefully made. Let's see... Mm, this is good.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> This karaage's seriously the best! This onigiri too...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Oh, that has...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Natto!? Who puts natto in onigiri; that's just weird.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> ...Hey, but it's still good. There's plums, and sardine, and, what else did you mix in here?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I used natto and plums as the base. After that, I would make some slight changes to add variety.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> I can tell you really challenged yourself with these onigiri, Mai. But, the sardines give it an interesting texture. It goes well together.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Mmhmm, that's Mai-chan for you. I'm glad to be on this earth if it means I get to eat onigiri this good~~~!!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> ...What do you think of them, Kanami-chan?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Of course I think they're extra delicious! The ginger fried pork and kinpira are really good too, but I love the natto onigiri the most!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> ...I'm glad to hear it.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> (I made that bento so you could eat it here, after all...)<br><strong>Mai:</strong> (It might not be the picnic we planned on, but I think this might be fine in its own way.)<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah~, that totally hit the spot~. I wish I could eat your cooking every day, Mai-chan!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> -!!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Oh, nothing helps a full stomach like some exercise! That's my aradama-chan, always looking out for me!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> You're the last of 'em! I love you!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> So, that aradama had a teru teru bozu too?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Wait? This is...<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Did you notice something about the teru teru bozu?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Could you let me see that, Hiyori-chan?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Sure.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Thank you.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> ...Mm, I'm sure of it. This is the teru teru bozu I made for today.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Why would something you made end up here...?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I thought it was in my room when I left, but... After that, maybe an aradama got it...?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Hang on, there's a bigger mystery here than that!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Yui-chan?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> This smells... I can smell it...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> ...Smell what?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> The finely crafted bento, and the teru teru bozu hoping to stop the rain...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> The weather forecast did say the rainy season would end today.<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Exactly, which means, Mai-chan must have had plans to go on a date with someone today!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ohh-! That's amazing, Yui-chan! You almost figured it out!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> (Wait, why did Kanami answer?)<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Was it with Sayaka-chan!? Were you going on a date with Sayaka-chan!?  
<strong>Kofuki:</strong> Get ahold of yourself. If she were going on a date with Sayaka, there would've been a bunch of cookies in the bento box, right?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> ...Ah-! You're right!!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Umm, I do have cookies here...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> I'll have some!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Ah, can I have some too!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> (Chew chew)... So anyway, who were you going on a date with?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I was...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> (It's not something I need to keep a secret, but... For some reason, I don't want to say...)<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> I guess this is no time for us to be standing around talking.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Ah-! A real big one showed up! Time to help myself to dessert!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Let's go, everyone!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Yeah!  </p><h2 id="3-the-scenery-we-once-saw" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>3: The Scenery We Once Saw</h2><p><strong>Aradama:</strong> oouuu...<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Phew, we're just about done with them all.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> What, that's it already?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> I'm totally beat... Fighting in the rain is actually pretty tough...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Do you want to take a short break then? If we wait a moment, the rain should clear up too.<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> I don't see why not.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Mai-chan.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> What is it, Kanami-chan?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Will you come take a walk with me?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> (Kanami-chan... What could she want, asking that out of the blue?)<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Mai-chan, do you remember?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Eh?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> We've been here before.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> ...You remembered that, Kanami-chan?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> How could I forget!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> The time we stopped here, back when we had just become toji, on our way back from a mission. This place is important to us.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Me too... I would never forget.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> To tell the truth, I was thinking of coming here for our picnic.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> You were!?  
<strong>Mai:</strong> That's why, it was kind of depressing. This was the only place the rain didn't clear up... And then we were called on to suppress aradama.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Mai-chan...<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Even so... Getting to talk with you like this now... I'm a little glad.<br><strong>Mai:</strong> A lot happened, but... I think we got to make a more memories here than just a simple picnic, didn't we?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Of course we did! I'll never forget about coming here today!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Kanami-! Mai-!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Hiyori-chan? What does she want?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> Let's go find out, Kanami-chan!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> What is it, Hiyori-chan?<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> Look up at the sky!<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> The sky...? Ah!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> A rainbow...<br><strong>Yui:</strong> I never noticed this place was so beautiful.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> That's a weirdly decent comment from you. Did Mai's bento fix you?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> What if... It's purifying me from inside out!?  
<strong>Hiyori:</strong> ...I'm sure if we had eaten Mai's bento while looking out on this, it would have tasted even better.<br><strong>Kanami/Mai:</strong> ...Pfft. Ahaha!<br><strong>Hiyori:</strong> What's with the two of you?<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> Oh, it's nothing! I was thinking the same thing, Hiyori-chan!<br><strong>Mai:</strong> In that case, how would you all feel about coming to a picnic here?<br><strong>Mai:</strong> I'd want Sayaka-chan and the others to see this scenery too.<br><strong>Kanami:</strong> That'd be great!<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Bring the same onigiri with you again!
