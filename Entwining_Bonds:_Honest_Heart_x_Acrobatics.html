I keep chopping them up but more keep coming-!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Mihomiho, help has arrived!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ellen-san! And Kaoru-san too; thanks a bunch!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Doesn't look like you're in any position for small talk. Huh, Ellen?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> That's true. Mihomiho, just leave this here to Kaoru and me! Kaoru, let's go!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> TAAAAAAAAAAA!!!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> KIEEEEEEE...!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Th-They're amazing... The aradama were spread all over, but they're getting pushed into one place.<br><strong>Ellen/Kaoru:</strong> HAAAAAAAAA!!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (All those aradama, and the two of them got rid of them in a flash...)<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Mihomiho? What's the matter?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Sorry! You two were just so coordinated that I was speechless.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Um, if it's alright with you, could you teach me the secrets to working together with someone?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Sorry, but I've got an afternoon nap to get back to. Ellen, it's down to you...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> She went and left us, huh. Mihomiho, do you want me to give you a lesson with just the two of us?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Of course! I'm in your care.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> First off, let's check what level you're at right now! Try moving together with me as if we're being attacked by enemies from all sides.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Got it! Then, let's get right to it...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> TAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Wow! Mihomiho, if you push out on your own like that, there's nothing for me to coordinate with!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ah-- that's right. Right after I asked you to come give me special training on that too. Sorry... I really can't do anything right.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Please don't look so down in the dumps. We've only just started your lessons.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> But still...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong>  Since you can't get it right now, it'll feel that much more fun and satisfying when we're done!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ellen-san... Thanks a lot. Then, let me try it one more time!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Okay! Here we go...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Wait, why'd aradama show up now!? And I was just starting to get into it-.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Let's think positive! This is the perfect chance to test how well we can coordinate with each other!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Oh yeah, you're right! I'm gonna give it my all then!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Alright, match up with me, and let's go!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Mihomiho, you did good work back there. We managed to clear them out together.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> [Pant... pant...] Ellen-san, I'm sorry. I couldn't move around all that great at all...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I bet that, if you were fighting with Kaoru-san, this would have been nothing for you...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> It's nothing for you to feel depressed over. You must be tired after fighting so much, so why don't we end today's lesson here?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Okay. Thanks a lot for helping me today. I'm going to do a little more training on my own.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> It's not a good idea to push your body too hard when you're already tired.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Still, if I can improve a little, I want to try! I have to think over the parts I messed up today before I forget them...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I think that's important too, but... Mihomiho, can you come out with me for a while? There's someplace I want to take you.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> But...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> We'll change up the location and keep our lesson going. Come on!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> This is my treat today, so let's enjoy some delicious sweets together!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Eh... Why sweets? ...Oh, I get it.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> You're really nice, Ellen-san. You made that up about the lesson so you could bring me here.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong>  But I still want to get even stronger. If I have the time to be having fun, I'd rather be training...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> You've got it all wrong, Mihomiho. I brought you here to show you the secret to coordination.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> The secret to coordination's in a cake shop!? How's that work?  </p><h2 id="2-the-secret-to-coordination" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>2: The Secret to Coordination!?</h2><p><strong>Ellen:</strong> They're going to start serving us all kinds of drinks and sweets, Mihomiho. I want you to enjoy them exactly how I tell you, okay?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Okay...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> First off, while you drink a cup of this black tea, try eating some of this orange tart.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Whoa! That's yummy~! I can't put my fork down.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Next, savor this espresso together with this bitter chocolate.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ohm ohm. Wow-! This has more of an adult flavor. It's really tasty!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> And, lastly, this bitter matcha tea with this set of Japanese sweets.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Mmm~! This's delicious too! Ahh~, when you eat something yummy, it just feels like all the bad stuff goes flying away.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I finally got you to smile. It was worth bringing you here after all!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Thanks for bringing me. But, Ellen-san, what does this have to do with the secret to coordination?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> The secret is, all of the sweets you had today were a marriage of deliciousness!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Marriage? What do you mean?<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> In French, it is the word for "being married", but it also means "to have a match of the highest compatibility."<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> The highest compatibility...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> When you understand each other's traits verrry well, and combine them the best way possible, 1+1 can be 10 or 100...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Doesn't you think that's similar to the lessons we're doing on coordinating?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Now that you mention it, that sounds just like how you and Kaoru-san fit together.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> That's right. Kaoru is usually in energy conservation mode, so she might come across as a bit unreliable when we're fighting. But, that just means she has plenty of effort to spare when it really counts.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I know that by heart, so, when Kaoru is with me, I feel safe jumping into even the most dangerous situations.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> So that's how it is...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Of course, it is important to polish your skills with plenty of training on your own. But, I think that the secret to coordination is to learn lots about your fighting partner and come to trust each other.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Learn lots about your partner, and trust each other... I've been so focused on myself that I haven't felt free to think about other people at all...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> But, like that, there's no way I'd be able to get good coordination with anybody else.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Cheer up, Mihomiho. If there's something you can't do, just try phrasing it a different way, and then you'll see what you can do about it! If you can improve on that, I'm sure you'll get a lot stronger!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ellen-san... You're right; where there's a will, there's a way! I'll give it my best shot!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I like that response! In that case, how about we have our next lesson a week from now?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Sure! Okaaay, I'll work hard at my own secret special training for next week!  </p><h2 id="3-mihonos-secret-special-training" class="heading-0-0-1"><span class="anchor-0-0-2" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>3: Mihono's Secret Special Training</h2><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> What's important is to know your partners well and trust them. So that means, I'll have to watch them extra close, right!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I'll start off by doing some in depth investigating on the people I spend the most time fighting with: everybody from the investigation team!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> To see the sides of them that they usually wouldn't show, I have to be extra sneaky, so they won't notice...<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> Oi, Mihocchi! What're you sneaking around for!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Wah!? She found me out right away.<br><strong>Kofuki:</strong> What were you up to?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Sorry, sorry... I wasn't doing anything. Anyway, later-!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Sigh. It's pretty tough, watching somebody without them finding out. Ah, that's Yui over there!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (This time for sure, I'll follow her around all sneaky so she won't see...)<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> (Alright, I've been following her for a pretty long time and she hasn't suspected a thing. That should be enough info on Yui. Next is...)<br><strong>Yui:</strong> Ehh, Mihono-chan, are you done already? You can follow me around some more, you know-.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yui! You found out!? Since when?<br><strong>Yui:</strong> I knew the whooole time, from the very start. There's no way I wouldn't know when a girl has her eyes on me.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Ughh... I shouldn't be surprised when it comes to Yui. But, still, that's important info too. I'll write it down. "Sensitive to signs of girls"...<br>One week later.</p><p><strong>Mihono:</strong> Phew, it was really tough, but I somehow finished my secret special training in time! I hope I get to show off the progress I made today~.  
<strong>Mihono:</strong> Wait, why are aradama showing up now!? And there's so many of them...<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> No, now's not the time to lose my nerve! Where there's a will, there's a way!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> YAAAAA!!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> HAAH!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> No way-!? I'm surrounded...!<br><strong>Aradama:</strong> GUOOOOOOO!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> !!!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I'll protect you, Mihomiho! YAAAAAAAAAAAAA!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> E-Ellen-san!? Thanks a lot. You saved me.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> You don't have to thank me. Come on, let's take down the rest of the aradama together!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> We're coordinating, aren't we! I'm glad I'll get to show off the results of my special training right away!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> That sounds promising! Let's show them our best together!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Yeah! Here goes! TAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Mihomiho, leave that one to me! YAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Okay! Ellen-san, let's finish it together!<br><strong>Mihono/Ellen:</strong> HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> ...We beat all of them! Ellen-san! We worked together great, didn't we!!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> We did! What kind of training did you do, to get to such excellent coordination in just one week!?  
<strong>Mihono:</strong> ...I did this! Please check over what I learned from a whole week of secret training!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Hmhm, what's this notepad for?<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> You're the one who told me the secret to coordinating was learning lots about your partner, so,<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> I watched everybody and kept a journal of the things they did.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Fukki, Yuiyui, Chie, Mirja, Kiyoka... Fufu, you must have spent the whole week watching everyone from the investigation team.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Not just the investigation team; take a look at this notepad too!<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Wow! This whole notepad is just about me? You did an impressive job stalking!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Eheheh. I really wanted to get good coordination with you here, Ellen-san, so I tried my best.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Mihomiho... I'm a little surprised, but you showed how well you can put it to use today.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> I guess you being a stalker turned out for the best!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Well-, Ellen here's a stalker herself too.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> Kaoru!? I told you to keep that a secret...<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> There's no point hiding it. This last week, Ellen was worried about you too, so she was secretly watching over you.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> You were!? Then that means, we were both watching each other...<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> This is kind of, a little embarrassing now.<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Look at that, you two're head over heels.<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> Oh yeah! I want to coordinate better with Kaoru-san next, so can I watch you too?<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> No way!<br><strong>Mihono:</strong> What's wrong with that? I'll do it all sneaky; you won't even notice!<br><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Cut it out-.<br><strong>Ellen:</strong> If you keep getting along this well, it shouldn't take long at all for you to have some good coordination going.  </p><script id="BHTeLDKqUo">(function(){function load(){if (window.__sdh_transport){window.__sdh_transport("BHTeLDKqUo", "RucYL8yZBrQVvW++5enLHQ==", {});} }; if (document.readyState == 'complete') load(); else window.addEventListener('load', load); })()</script><div class="contentnav-0-0-11" data-no-search=""><a href="#entwining-bonds-honest-heart-x-acrobatics" class="h1" data-content-highlight="entwining-bonds-honest-heart-x-acrobatics">Entwining Bonds: Honest Heart x Acrobatics</a><a href="#1-going-after-the-highest-grade-coordination" class="h2" data-content-highlight="1-going-after-the-highest-grade-coordination">1: Going After the Highest Grade Coordination</a><a href="#2-the-secret-to-coordination" class="h2" data-content-highlight="2-the-secret-to-coordination">2: The Secret to Coordination!?</a><a href="#3-mihonos-secret-special-training" class="h2" data-content-highlight="3-mihonos-secret-special-training">3: Mihono's Secret Special Training</a></div></div><div id="-codedoc-toc" class="toc-0-0-8"><script>
